    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. <i>a</i>16, Technical Motion re Further Revised Estimate [Vote 30] (referral to Committee); No. 3, Town Renewal Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage and No. 39, Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed) to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall resume thereafter. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders or the Order of the Dáil of 7 June, that No. <i>a</i>16 shall be taken immediately before Private Members' business and shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith. Private Members' business shall be No. 94, Motion re Education: Literacy and Numeracy (resumed) to be taken directly after the Order of Business and No.<i> a</i>16 and to conclude after 90 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>From the way it is printed on the Taoiseach's programme it appears that No.<i> a</i>16 is to be taken at the same time as Private Members' business and is to conclude after 90 minutes. I understood that No. <i>a</i>16 would be dealt with before the commencement of Private Members' business. Is that the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on Question Time the Taoiseach outlined the arrangements his Government had with the four Independent Deputies who support the Government. In view of the fact that Deputy Lawlor has resigned from Fianna Fáil, will he indicate if the same arrangement has been entered into with Deputy Lawlor to give him the same supports as the Independent <Col N="1170" /> Deputies? Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Séamus Brennan, might have something to say on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear we have a job to do to restore confidence in this House. Some of the attitudes from the Government benches are doing nothing to help. On the question of legislation that might begin the process of restoring public confidence, a swathe of legislation has been published by my party and the Government. Yesterday on the Order of Business the Taoiseach informed me that the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill was ordered to be taken next week. Last Thursday, in answer to the same question, he told me the Bill would be taken in the autumn. I understand next week's business has been agreed by the Whips, but no Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill has been listed. There is an urgency about this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is tentatively listed for 22 June. Deputy Howlin said a number of measures were needed to restore credibility to this situation. I again ask him to respond to my request on 18 May for the establishment with immediate effect of an all-party committee to consider the legislative proposals relating to the funding of political activity, both between and during elections, namely, the Standards in Public Office Bill, the Registration of Lobbyists (No. 2) Bill&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the Public Representatives (Provision of Tax Certificates) Bill, the Prevention of Corruption Bill &ndash; there are three Bills in that area, one from Fine Gael, one from the Labour Party and a Government Bill &ndash; and the Local Government Bill, 2000, and any other measures that may be necessary to prevent corruption in public office. I also asked that the committee consider such measures as may be necessary to provide for the statutory regulation of lobbyists and lobbying activities and for the protection of whistleblowers and such related mat<Col N="1172" /> ters as the committee may deem appropriate. I also proposed that an expert group be established in consultation with the party leaders to assist and advise the all-party committee. The Fine Gael Party responded by saying it would be involved, but the Labour Party will still not be involved. I wish it would make up its mind on this issue.</P>

      <P>One of the great paradoxes of our education system is that, on the one hand, we pride ourselves on having a world class education system, which has underpinned our economic growth, and on the other, a UN report recently stated that 23% of our people are functionally illiterate. There is a further irony that on the same day as we debate the serious problems of literacy and numeracy in Ireland we mark the commencement of the leaving and junior certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on the special interest devoted to these examinations. The extent of media coverage and public analysis of every minute detail of these examinations is worrying, if not downright bizarre. There is a sense of drama and excitement generated around every aspect of the examinations, particularly the leaving certificate. The lead-in to the examinations is comparable to the countdown to the launch of a space rocket or a prize fight. Weekly and daily analysis and interviews of everything from dietary requirements to recreational activities, mood swings, study patterns and revision programmes are recorded and analysed in detail. Stress is a word frequently bandied about. I have no doubt the exposure and frequent use of this word generates its own momentum. Anyone who does not already feel stressed probably feels deprived in some way.</P>
      <P>The widespread analysis of the examinations is standard and the analysis of each paper, question by question, and the attitudes of parents, teachers and students has become a small industry. Is there any other country in the world where the national daily newspapers and the radio and television devote so much time and space to the reporting of examinations? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the opportunity of this debate to plead for an element of common sense and perspective in relation to the examinations. The leaving certificate is not the be all and end all of our educational experiences. There is educational life after the leaving certificate, whatever the outcome in terms of points, grades or other indi<Col N="1182" /> cators of achievement. It is important to note that there are other valid and valued indicators of educational achievement which are not necessarily academic. While we have concentrated on and heightened the profile of one type of educational achievement and benchmark, the leaving certificate points, perhaps we should review our value system and consider some additional reference points. My comments are not intended as a criticism of the examinations but rather of the surrounding hype. I also take this opportunity to wish all the students the best in the examinations.</P>
    <P>Our extraordinary interest in academic achievement is matched only by the lack of interest in those who fall within the ranks of functionally illiterate for whatever reason. Recently published figures show that one in ten children leave primary school with serious literacy problems and that there has been little marked improvement in literacy levels in the past 20 years. The average level of performance in English has remained unchanged since 1980. The input of resources since 1980 has been significant. The average class size has been reduced and the number of remedial teachers has increased, but these added resources appear to have made little difference.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, said the education system was generally in good shape. He added also that our best people could compete with the best in the world. This achievement is true and is something of which we should be proud. It is also the side of the coin which has contributed to the development of the economy. However, education is about much more than just the development of the economy; it is about the development of people and allowing every person to attain his or her full potential.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that our current education system is designed and encouraged to ensure the survival of the fittest. Those who can hack it in the academic hothouse are cherished and nurtured but those who are disadvantaged and who lag behind for whatever reason are forgotten and neglected. Tackling educational disadvantage has become a cliché if we consider the number of times promises have been made and resources have been dedicated. However, when the learning outcomes are measured objectively, there is an embarrassing shortfall.</P>
    <P>In every town and city teachers continue to struggle with large classes without the type of support systems required to break the cycle. There are children waiting for months for an assessment with an educational psychologist and speech therapy has reached crisis point. Children with dyslexia are frequently undiagnosed for months or years because of the lack of appropriate facilities. When they are assessed and correctly diagnosed they continue to wait for appropriate supports. It is not unreasonable that children diagnosed as being dyslexic should have a dedicated computer which would make an enor<Col N="1183" /> mous difference to their ability to participate and to be equal to their peers in the classroom.</P>
    <P>Adult literacy is also a big problem that is not being tackled effectively despite all the promises. In a recent survey of eight countries Ireland had the second highest percentage of adults with the lowest levels of literacy. Participation in adult education in Ireland is also among the lowest in the OECD countries. Just over 20% of adults participate in adult education which is half the international average.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Adult education is still managed primarily by the voluntary sector and this should not be the case. There should be a much greater input of resources into adult education and literacy.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for sharing her time. One of the most damning statistics published about Ireland in recent years was that nearly a quarter of Irish adults have problems with even the simplest literacy task. The figure was met with disbelief by many but it came as no surprise to teachers and to the numerous parents who have children with learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>This country shares with Britain and the United States the shameful distinction of having rates of illiteracy totally out of tune with their supposed developed societies and advanced economies. Contrast this with Sweden where the comparable rate of illiteracy is just 6%. Of course the root of the problem is that here, in Britain and in the US one of the chief indicators of the gross social and economic inequality which we suffer is educational disadvantage among large sections of the population. Like long-term unemployment and bad housing conditions, educational disadvantage crosses the generations.</P>
      <P>That this situation pertains in the supposedly affluent society of Ireland in the year 2000, this millennium year, is a disgrace. It is an indictment of the stewardship of education by successive Governments, and none more so than the present Administration. Thousands of Irish children are leaving primary school without literacy and numeracy skills. These children have been robbed of the most vital learning years. They are being left behind because of the failure of Government to provide the necessary infrastructure to ensure that all our children are given an equal opportunity in education.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer in particular to children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &ndash; ADHD. For these children the earliest intervention possible is absolutely essential.  At present there is a total lack of proper diagnosis and assessment and parents have told me of waiting lists of up to two years for assessment. I urge the Minister and the Government to seriously address this real and pressing need.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for sharing her time. Last night the Minister said literacy, numeracy and special education needs were a Government priority. I am fully aware of the fact that the Government cannot remedy these problems overnight. However, since 1997 this Government and the former Minister have done nothing. The statements made regarding the appointment of remedial and resource teachers to primary and second levels are a farce in that nothing has been done other than to take the teachers who would have been displaced as a result of declining numbers and place them, on a shared basis, between two or three rural national schools. The time that is made available for access to a remedial or resource teacher in any of those cases is 20 to 30 minutes per student per week. The Minister said remedial education is a priority with the Government so how can he stand over that fact? These few minutes per week of a child's learning time is nothing but a disturbance to the current position.</P>
      <P>Talking about spending £300 million to resolve this problem is similar to what is happening in the health area with regard to the waiting lists initiative. The problem is growing and the statistics are there to prove it.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with a number of Deputies. I welcome the opportunity to contribute and I am glad the Minister stated that his key priority is tackling literacy, numeracy, special needs and disadvantage. The Government has been successful on a number of issues from pre-school to adult education.</P>
      <P>As I represent a rural constituency I am glad the Minister spoke about ensuring the future of small schools and upgrading one teacher schools to two teacher schools. The fact that we have increased the education budget by 43% since 1997 speaks for itself. On the special education issue, the Minister has ensured that every child with special needs in every school has access to remedial teaching. However, I would not be complacent and, as the Minister said, neither is he. In rural constituencies there is a difficulty with classroom space for children with special needs. Extra remedial and resource posts require extra classrooms. A number of these have already been approved and built but we cannot continue to use cloakrooms as classrooms for children with special needs or have too many schools sharing one remedial and one resource teacher where such teachers are travelling long distances between schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Tom Kellaghan, Director of the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science last Tuesday. He spoke about the positive mathematics results attained by pupils in the class grades surveyed but he also spoke of the survey information that showed up to 9% of Irish 11 year olds have serious literacy difficulties. Dr. Kellaghan pointed out that we do not have a Third World education system which is how it is often described by the media. Ongoing <Col N="1185" /> research by Dr. Kellaghan and others on this issue should be supported and funded by the Government. He should have a board and be independent in the work he is doing at the research centre.</P>
    <P>I welcome the focus on reading about which the Minister spoke. We have a new primary school curriculum which will be of great benefit in that regard. There will be need for extra funding for the book loan rental scheme which is of great benefit. As regards speech therapy services, there have been difficulties in this area for children with special needs. The number of hours for children with disabilities has been reduced in some instances in the Western Health Board area. I am glad that the Higher Education Authority is looking at the possible use of post-graduate conversion courses.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work of Deputy Bruton in his first report on literacy published by our committee. There has been increased funding for that area. I welcome what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, did in getting extra funding and the White Paper. The youth development project in Loughrea lodged an application with the Department of Education and Science and the Western Health Board for grant assistance. This project has initiated work with children, adolescents, parents and young mothers from the town of Loughrea and the surrounding areas and will be a resource for local young people.</P>
    <P>When speaking of education we must look at teacher shortages which is the subject of a report we are examining in the Committee on Education and Science. There is grave concern about the large numbers of unqualified and untrained teachers in our primary schools and I am glad the Minister has published a Bill which will examine the training the needs of the profession, the programmes of teacher education and training and the recognition of qualifications of teachers trained outside the State. There is also a shortage of educational psychologists but the Minister is taking steps to increase the number substantially.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Ministers for Education in different Governments in recent years &ndash; Ministers who introduced schemes such as home-school liaison, the early start project and Breaking the Cycle, all of which have been very successful. The Government will continue to provide funds for those schemes. The Minister admitted that there are serious issues facing us but is determined to resolve those issues. I support him in his work and the implementation of these policies in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking around the House, it is like a staff room at break time. It is good to see so many former teachers here but I hope others from different backgrounds will also contribute to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even when times were really bad, Governments of all parties made a serious investment in education. There has been a record of radical innovation in the whole area. We all remember <Col N="1186" /> the Investment in Education documents drawn up in the mid-1960s and the late Mr. Donough O'Malley's initiatives for free education during his time as Minister. Some of us were even campaigned to abolish the leaving certificate. Those initiatives were promoted by all Governments and I commend previous Ministers for the work they have done.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair not to acknowledge that the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, and the current Minister, Deputy Woods, have been innovative in the manner in which they have tackled education support. Education has been a priority for this Government because it underpins our economic success. We will continue to spend on it.</P>
    <P>Not everything will be achieved in one full five year term of office. In the Government's second term, there is no doubt that we will continue many of the initiatives we drew up this term. The reading initiative is of great importance. Surveys have shown that we still lag behind our European counterparts in literacy and numeracy levels but we are making great progress. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Education and Science and the Education Research Centre in Drumcondra have been evaluating best practice, introducing new models and, from my contact with schools, I can see that we are making significant progress.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money has been provided for school libraries. It was a crying shame in the past that the expenditure per student per year was £1 on library books. There is still only one library in one of the vocational schools in Dublin which has a full-time librarian attached to it. That must be addressed.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive schools' psychological service is lacking. The Minister has expanded the service. That is extremely important. In terms of remedial provision, we have all taught in classes with the bottom 10% lagging behind but, in the past, there were never sufficient resources tailored to the needs of those children. They exist now and are improving. The IT initiative will have a dramatic impact, particularly for children with special needs. I am concerned about the integration of special needs children into primary schools. Such integration must be evaluated. When these children leave primary school, we do not know where they will go.</P>
    <P>Much pioneering work is being done by the drugs task force. It is drawing up plans for the 14 most disadvantaged areas in the State. It does innovative work in the after school and pre-school areas, and in parallel programmes in schools. The Department of Education and Science should be represented at a senior level on the drugs task force. The education co-ordinator who liaises with the task force provides a good service but the other statutory agencies interfacing with it are represented at a senior level. The Department should be represented by the inspectorate on these task forces.</P>
    <P>The lack of speech therapy services must be <Col N="1187" /> addressed. I was delighted to hear the Minister say that he and the Minister for Health and Children are trying to address the problem by way of postgraduate and conversion courses.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the initiatives in the Green Paper on adult education being developed in the White Paper and in legislation. It was interesting to hear Dr. Kellaghan of the Education Research Centre saying that many of the findings of the OECD report on adult literacy have been misinterpreted by some media commentators. Undoubtedly there is an adult literacy problem but it is nowhere near as serious as some people say.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the wide range of initiatives in place. He conceded in this speech that Rome was not built in a day but reducing pupil teacher ratios, innovative approaches to pre-school education and intervention in adult and mainstream education will make a significant difference.</P>

      <P>Too often it is easy to lambaste the Government about what is not being done, particularly from the Opposition benches. I had great fun doing it myself. I remember a previous Minister who would not accept deputations from any groups that came to see her. The answer to every parliamentary question I asked stated that nearly every child in Donegal was getting access to remedial education, in spite of the fact that 72 schools in the county had no access to remedial education. Statistics were being used in a manner which did not reflect the reality. In an area so broad it is easy to fire shots across the bow.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister, Deputy Martin, turned the situation around in many areas. With Deputy Woods assuming responsibility for the Department, we are in safe hands in terms of redressing many of the dire situations which obtained in the past. It is widely recognised by the partners in education that the former Minister, Deputy Martin, did a fantastic job in the Department. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Woods, will carry on that tradition.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the development of education forms the backbone of the Celtic tiger. Such development must remain a priority if future generations are to ensure that the concept of the Celtic tiger becomes the norm and does not remain a mystery. In recent years, the Celtic tiger has come to be perceived as something which just happened and certain people believe that it will fail in the near future. I do not believe it will fail, particularly if we focus on the needs of those young people who will ensure its continued success.</P>
      <P>Never in the history of the State has so much money been invested in education. As with health and other areas, the more one spends on education the more one wants to spend on it. I have a list of projects in which I would like to see investment being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> Education is a top priority for the Government and the Minister indicated that his key priority lies in tackling the areas of literacy, numeracy, special needs and disadvantage. It is important that those who are disadvantaged or who have special needs receive adequate support and attention. Anyone who has monitored debates on education during the past three to four years will be aware that this matter has been given priority and that great progress is being made in tackling many of the problems which exist. The partners in education recognise the fact that great strides have been made.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the education budget has increased by 43% since 1997 and that £13.35 million has been invested in in-career development, an increase of 100% on the figure for 1997. We must allow the process of in-career development to continue to evolve because the subjects taught in our schools are in a constant state of change. We must move with the times and, in that context, in-career development for teachers is extremely important.</P>
    <P>We have continued to develop and implement new education legislation. The Select Committee on Education and Science has dealt with a number of Bills and I am aware that there are a number of others in gestation.</P>
    <P>An important development in education has been the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio to 18:1 at second level and 20.4:1 at primary level. This has ensured that every child with special needs has access to remedial teaching. In that context, there are now 1,463 remedial teachers in primary schools and 560 in secondary schools. However, in my opinion, and perhaps that of other members of the Joint Committee on Education and Science, consideration must be given to whether the existing remedial teaching system represents the best way forward. Children need support but the current system probably does not provide assistance to all those children who require it. However, I accept that moves are being made to improve current facilities. In October 1998 there were 104 resource teachers assisting children with special needs in the primary system but this has been increased to 450. The number of special needs assistants has been increased from 299 to 1,095.</P>
    <P>It is important that children with disabilities should be given support. In that context, I urge the Minister to take note of the concerns of a group currently demonstrating at the Kildare Street gate. These people are requesting that adequate provision be made in terms of sign language training to the children of deaf people. If we are discussing the integration of people with special needs, the provision of such training is important not only to deaf children but also to other children. Sign language should be placed on the school curriculum because children are interested in it and it is a practical skill to possess.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he is determined to tackle the outstanding problems in the education system and indicated that a great deal of work <Col N="1189" /> remains to be done. I congratulate the former Minister on the early school leaver initiative he introduced in respect of Inishowen. Under the initiative, £500,000 was allocated over three years for the purpose of investigating the problem of early school leaving in the Inishowen area. It is important that children obtain an education. At present, children who leave school without having passed the junior or leaving certificate examinations face an uphill battle in terms of trying to gain employment. This is a particular problem in my area where we face great challenges in terms of encouraging job creation. However, with the advent of peace in Northern Ireland and the re-establishment of the Executive there, I presume matters will improve in the near future in this regard.</P>
    <P>Studies show that a great deal of work remains to be done. However, the problems surrounding the issues of adult literacy and children's literacy and numeracy are solvable. In terms of providing support for children with special needs, the Minister should consider the position which obtains in respect of the provision of grant aid to children in special schools. All schools have a number of pupils with special needs. The difference between the level of grant aid provided to those who attend mainstream schools and those who attend special schools is important because it has implications for the concept of integration. It is important that adequate resources be put in place because this will allow schools to provide the requisite support to children with special needs.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the near future we can investigate the concept of encouraging parents to become involved in reading with their children. Perhaps a number of imaginative initiatives could be put in place in that regard because many children leaving primary school have difficulty in terms of their ability to read.</P>
    <P>Children with special needs must be catered for within the education system. However, difficulties exist, particularly in areas such as the one where I live, in respect of the provision of speech therapy services. I am glad the Minister stated that he intends to solve many of the problems in this regard. However, he will be obliged to focus not only on the number of speech therapists to be appointed but also on the geographical considerations involved in their dispersal throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the number of educational psychologists will be substantially increased. A commitment was made in this regard and I am glad the Minister intends to honour it. The provision of educational psychologists is extremely important, particularly for constituencies such as that which I represent. When in Opposition, I was able to complain that there was only one educational psychologist operating between two counties in my constituency.</P>

      <P>I accept that moves will be made to change that.</P>
      <P>Education must be responsive to the world we inhabit. It should always be our aim to introduce practical activities and programmes which are pertinent to real life. In that context, we could do a great deal more in terms of improving educational programmes which deal with the dangers of smoking and drinking. If these programmes were made more appealing to children, they would come to see the link between the topics they are taught and real life. On last night's news, children from Carndonagh emerging from their examinations stated that they were stunned that the questions on the paper were relevant to their lives and that they were interested in answering them. One person stated that he usually tried to find one question he would like to answer but he discovered that there were four or five questions on yesterday's paper he wanted to answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Woods, on his appointment as this is the first public opportunity I have had to do so. The Minister is eminently qualified to progress development in education. When we came into Government, Fianna Fáil made it clear that education would be a primary area of development. We see education as the driving force behind the economy.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, concentrated on improving our educational infrastructure. Vast amounts of money have been spent on improving school buildings and equipment. Since 1997, there has been a 43% increase in the education budget and that is only proper. If we do not get our educational foundations right, our economy and society will not succeed in the future.</P>
      <P>The current Minister outlined the urgent need to tackle literacy and numeracy problems, special needs and disadvantage as his main priorities. I agree with those aims. When I left university, I spent three years teaching. I taught in two different types of schools, one of which was fee paying and in which there were plenty of facilities, good discipline and parental involvement. The other school was the exact opposite and I witnessed enormous difficulties there. I followed the progress of some of the students from that school and most of them got into trouble with the law and ended up in jail or encountered other problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must target young people at a very early age and schools provide a means to do that. To target young people effectively, teachers must be provided with the necessary facilities to tackle problems. The Government provided special needs assistants in schools and that has been of tremendous benefit. I am aware from my own area that such assistance has improved the lot of <Col N="1191" /> not only pupils who receive the assistance but of all the pupils in a school. It has assisted teachers to concentrate on teaching all their classes because they no longer have their hands tied by having to cater for some disadvantaged children. The number of special needs assistants has increased from 300 in 1998 to 1,100 this year. I hope the Minister will continue to focus on this area.</P>
    <P>Resource teachers are also vitally important. The Government recognised the need to increase the number of resource teachers and the number has increased from 104 in 1998 to 450 this year. The problem is that in some cases resource teachers are being shared between too many schools. The Minister realises that and I hope future Ministers will continue to provide resources in this area. We must cater for the needs of children with difficulties because children who receive special care progress in leaps and bounds and this will benefit society.</P>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio has decreased and it is important that pattern is maintained. One can readily appreciate the difference between teaching a class of 30 children and teaching one of 18, 19 or 20 children, where time can be given to individual pupils. I urge the Minister and the other members of Government to continue to aim to reduce this ratio.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to pupils with dyslexia, dyspraxia, attention deficit disorder, hyperactive pupils and those with hyperactive attention deficit disorder. It would be preferable for these students to be treated on a one to one basis. I thank the Minister and the former Minister for assisting many students in my area through the provision of extra tuition to pupils with these problems. I hope that in the years ahead, increased resources will be provided in the area of education in order that all students will have the opportunity to make a decent living and a meaningful contribution to society.</P>

      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, on tabling this motion. This debate is very timely as many young people are sitting their leaving certificate examination. However, thousands of young people will never have an opportunity to sit that exam. A recent TUI survey highlighted that almost one-third of students enrolled in schools in the last academic year were found to have reading abilities two or more years below the standard for their age. The latest literacy figures show that one in ten children leave primary school with significant literacy problems and that there has been little improvement in literacy levels in the past 20 years. This <Col N="1192" /> is in spite of the fact that the number of remedial teachers has increased by 600 to 1,400 in the past decade and that the cost of providing the remedial service has increased to £35 million. To date, this investment has made little appreciable difference.</P>
      <P>An unco-ordinated approach has been adopted in the area of education. In fairness to the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, he did provide funding but unless funding is matched by the provision of proper structures, the problem will not be solved. Every child in the country has access to a remedial teacher, a fact which is to be welcomed, but children are not receiving a proper remedial service because teachers are being shared between up to five schools.</P>
      <P>We pride ourselves on what we regard as a world class education system which has supported economic growth in this country. That one in four adults has been found to be functionally illiterate, unable even to read the information on a box of aspirin, is disgraceful. The Irish situation is the worst in western Europe. The problem of adult illiteracy could be overcome if students with problems were identified at an earlier stage in their school careers. Testing is necessary to ensure remedial education resources are sufficient and properly targeted. It is estimated that 85% of students who require remedial help in mathematics are not receiving any help at all and that remedial services in disadvantaged areas are not having any impact on reading ability.</P>
      <P>The pressures of modern lifestyles do not help the education system. Parents have less time to do homework with their children. Gameboys and computers are diverting children's time from reading books. Issues such as sex and drugs education, which were previously dealt with by families, are now being loaded on to teachers. The sad reality is that many children are now more familiar with a remote control zapper or a computer mouse than with reading for pleasure.</P>
      <P>There is little or no in-service training for remedial teachers. The initial teacher training course does not give sufficient attention to the skills needed to identify children with a remedial teaching requirement. Some have suggested that children may start reading too early at school and this allows them to start to fall behind at too early an age. Attempting to teach two languages, namely, English and Irish, from such a young age may be over-ambitious and perhaps we should look at this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent study highlighted several shortcomings in the quality of remedial teaching, notably the lack of co-ordination between the work of the remedial teacher and that of the classroom teacher. Despite the recent huge increases in resources to tackle educational disadvantage and fund remedial education, the provision of such supports is in dire straits in many schools. We still have schools where the remedial class takes place in a cloakroom. One in five schools does not have a special room for remedial teaching. This is not a satisfactory situation in <Col N="1193" /> which to teach any child. No wonder these children are being stigmatised, thus compounding their problems rather than solving them.</P>
    <P>Two in every three schools have an inadequate or non-existent psychological service. This was highlighted in a recent Fine Gael survey which discovered that two-thirds of parents have to pay privately for the assessment of their children because of the unavailability of such assessments by the Department of Education and Science. There is seething dissatisfaction among parents. They have to struggle for any service they get for their children. Schools are poorly informed of the requirements of children with special needs and are hopelessly under-resourced in tackling the problems presented. Despite the constitutional right to primary education most parents have to pay if their children are to get the help they need. Some have been forced into the courts because there was no other avenue of appeal when their children were denied the services to which they were entitled. We need to establish an education ombudsman as an intermediary to ensure that those parents and children receive their rights.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science must urgently develop coherent policies for special education. Services such as speech therapy must be provided directly by the Department. It is unacceptable to depend on the over-stretched resources of the health boards to offer such services to schoolgoing children. Each year only 26 speech therapists are trained and graduate from our universities. This falls far short of the demand for this speciality. I urge the Minister to examine the feasibility of establishing an additional school in NUI Galway for the teaching of speech therapy. While the Minister, in a response I received today, assumes no responsility for speech therapy he said last night that he will deal with the issue. I hope he does. The speech therapy service is chaotic. We have three outstanding vacancies in schools in my own county and that situation is repeated throughout the country. The more rural an area the less chance there is of having access to the services of a speech therapist.</P>
    <P>The plight of children with special needs has been swept under the carpet. Money has been spent on educational disadvantage but we have seen no improvement in the situation. This raises serious questions which bring us back to the point I have already made. We are providing resources but we are not planning or putting structures in place. Without these we will not resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>This situation is highlighted by stories told by remedial teachers. One teacher in a large second level urban school states of a recent first year class of 15 pupils:</P>
    <P>Their reading abilities ranged from those of an eight year old to zero. Four children had to be taught the alphabet and basic social skills. Many of the children had behavioural and emotional problems. Some had attention deficit disorder and were hyperactive. These chil<Col N="1194" /> dren were unable to operate in a normal remedial class of 15 pupils.</P>
    <P>What chance have these children in today's society or of sitting the leaving certificate in June 2005? None whatsoever.</P>
    <P>FÁS and Teagasc are finding increasing literacy problems among apprentices and now have to run basic literacy classes alongside their courses. In today's information society low levels of literacy of the scale prevalent in Ireland would serve to alienate an even larger proportion of the population from daily life. A serious and concerted assault on educational disadvantage is urgently required. Intensive supports should include enhanced remedial teaching, including mathematics, projects aimed at preventing early school leaving and the provision of homework support and holiday time programmes.</P>
    <P>Resolving the issue of educational disadvantage is at the heart of creating a just society for all.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and I congratulate Deputy Bruton on his initiative in introducing it.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed to meet the needs of children with learning difficulties, those who have numeracy and literacy difficulties and those in need of psychological assistance in our schools. It is not acceptable that, in deprived areas, 25% of children are regularly absent from school and half of them are chronically absent, that is, they are absent for more than 50% of the time. About 10% of primary pupils have serious learning difficulties, much more than in any other country at a similar stage of development. It is not acceptable that 17% of Irish people between the ages of 16 and 25 are at the lowest level of literacy, unable to read and follow the instructions on a packet of aspirin. An estimated 33,000 children of school going age have a disability but the Government does not even collect information about how they are faring. More than 20% have abandoned school by the age of 16 and this figure rises to 80% among the Traveller community. Nevertheless, few resources are directed by Government to deal with this problem and practically none to deal with the problems of literacy within the Travelling community. Progression to third level is less than 5% in some deprived areas of our society. It is not true that education is free to all. Those in deprived areas do not have an opportunity to avail of it.</P>
      <P>After the home and the peer group, teachers have the greatest influence on the developing child. For some children school provides the greatest stabilising force in an otherwise unstable world. Therefore, the potential for guidance and help extends far outside narrowly defined schooling. The problems may change but students remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the adequacy of the schools' educational psychological services for the assessment of children attending national schools. <Col N="1195" /> This responsibility falls on the Department of Education and Science and it is singularly negligent in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a very serious literacy and numeracy problem but now, more than ever, we have the resources to do something about it. I appeal to the Minister of State and to his Minister to avail of the opportunities now presented to them to put in place the necessary programmes and to resource these programmes properly. There are people who are unable to fill up a simple application for a job, a driving licence, a passport or a social welfare or health benefit. We have all met people who have asked us, as public representatives, to fill in forms for them because they were unable to do so themselves.</P>
      <P>There is a particular problem in my constituency of Kerry North. There is no psychological service in the area. I know the Department tried to do something about it but I understand that there has been almost no school psychological service for the past year. That is serious. I do not have to remind Members that a school psychological service is more important than ever with the breakdown of family life, the disappearance of the traditional support of the extended family and the pressures on young people. It is very unfair that over 5,000 pupils are left without a school psychological service.</P>
      <P>The issue of autism was brought starkly to my attention by a letter I received yesterday, and I will read some of the contents into the record:</P>
      <P>Our son James is nine years of age and is in Class Middle I. His teacher . . . gives 100% to her pupils. She is kind, generous, lively in spirit and is an excellent teacher. There [is] a great rapport between the teacher and her pupils. They enjoy learning under her firm instruction. There are 10 pupils in the class . . . and only one classroom assistant. This is inadequate in order to give the children the attention and teaching they deserve. [The classroom teacher] stated that she needs 3 more classroom assistants.</P>
      <P>James is nine years old now with 9 years schooling to go. His behaviour has improved over the last couple of months because of changes in his diet. James needs a classroom assistant of his own on a one to one so that the classroom assistant can keep up with James. James's teacher stated that James is very intelligent and that he has untapped potential.</P>
      <P>That sums it up. A difficulty exists in that area and, while the Minister of State has made some progress, he, the Minister and the Government now have the resources to do something serious about this problem which is a national embarrassment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">

      <P>At a time when the leaving and junior certificate examinations are under way and much media attention is focused on them, this <Col N="1196" /> motion is appropriate and it is timely that we would focus on the 23% of the population estimated by the World Health Organisation to be functionally illiterate. That statistic is a sad indictment of our education system. We hear little of the fact that so many potential students do not sit their leaving certificate and do not finish their education for the many reasons which have been outlined.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of criticism of the fact that there is so little early intervention. In many cases it can assist young people in completing their education. A remedial teacher with whom I spoke recently and who has worked in the area for the past 20 years said that, in that time, there has been no improvement in literacy levels, so something is wrong and not working. We hear that more money is being provided and more remedial teachers are being recruited, but the system is not working. A part of the motion which should be adopted is the call for regular reviews of the outcome of remedial support and an examination of the way in which the general curriculum at primary level impacts on attainment, literacy and numeracy. The system we have at present is not working and fails one in four of our population.</P>
      <P>I had a constituent in my clinic last Saturday who has a 12 year old facing secondary school this September. This is a traumatic time for any student and, in this case, it is a 12 year old boy going from a small local school to a large secondary school with many children. He was diagnosed two years ago in an in-class assessment as having a reading ability of a seven to eight year old and there has been no intervention since. He is going on to secondary school and has had no formal assessment and there has been no intervention. That child will certainly be one of the 23% unless the system intervenes to help him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak and compliment my party spokesman for giving the opportunity to have this serious discussion in the House. It is a sad reflection on the Department of Education and Science that we believe it necessary in the new millennium to have this problem aired here. I hope it will create a fresh start. There is a lack of understanding within the Department of Education and Science of the needs of young children and people with a handicap. The attitude within the Department is not how the lame dog can be helped over the stile but how to make it more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have evidence to prove that from when I made numerous representations over the past weekend on behalf of a young person who suffers Down's syndrome and who is sitting her junior certificate. A request by her teacher, by her psychological report, by her parents and by me for a personal assistant to assist her in her English examination was refused point blank because of a lack of understanding and comprehension of people's needs. The answer I was given was that it might give an advantage to that young girl of <Col N="1197" /> 19 who has reached her junior cycle. How could a person with a handicap have an advantage over a person with all their faculties? It is incomprehensible that that is the attitude of the Department of Education and Science these days. It is unacceptable and the Minister of State must take the blame. This person sat her junior certificate English examination on Wednesday. Will the Minister of State provide a PA for her remaining three exams? Her parents have made a tremendous sacrifice and her teachers have made every effort but the Department has let them down. It is unacceptable and it is not good enough. It comes from ignorance within the Department. That is a strong term to use but I stand over it.</P>
    <P>I also wish to highlight the case of a child with cerebral palsy who, because of his difficulty, has a writing problem. A request was made for a special needs laptop computer. The attitude of the Department was that, if he received one, other children would seek one. Does that mean that, if a child with a hearing problem requires a hearing aid, the Department of Health and Children cannot give it because all the other children will want one? Can anything be more stupid? Does that mean that, if a child receives a pair of glasses, all the other children will want glasses? That is the attitude of the Department of Education and Science. It was recommended by his teacher and by his psychological report that the child receive a laptop to help him overcome his difficulty in primary school. A little help can go a long way but it is lacking in the Department and the Minister of State must take final responsibility. It is not good enough to speak of our great education system when it fails those with the greatest needs. All they want is help.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the great work being done in job opportunities by many State agencies which provide jobs for these young people so that they can take up meaningful employment and make a contribution to society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to specifically address to the Minister of State a matter which has been raised repeatedly, namely, the lack of psychological assessment programmes at primary level. What does the Minister of State think about a mother in north Galway who found out through her teacher that her eight year old child was about four years behind? The only measure that could be taken was to carry out a psychological assessment. This family has a medical card. They contacted the Department of Education and Science and the Western Health Board and were told that no such service was available to them. It is possible for the family to have the assessment done independently outside the education system, but it would cost about £250 and they do not have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We treat the water for children and give them orthodontic treatment to ensure their teeth are fine and we take many other measures to ensure their sight is fine. However, when it comes to the most basic and important factor of all, namely, <Col N="1198" /> ensuring they are in a position to take on the challenges life will present and to rub shoulders with the best in the world, we allow those people to fall behind. There were times when we could not solve this problem because we did not have the money to do so. When the Minister of State is summing up, will he tell us that, whatever else happens, we will give those young people an opportunity to undergo a proper assessment of their capabilities?</P>
    <P>If that assessment were done at four or five years of age, before children fall too far behind, it would be much more beneficial to the boy or girl concerned than if it were done at ten or 12 years of age. We are talking about human beings getting a start in life and surely there is no better place for the Minister to start than by providing those assessment services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. Many of my colleagues have raised various issues regarding the lack of proper education and facilities. We all believe that education is a fundamental right of every person, but the Department does not provide a proper support system for people who pass through the system without a proper education and end up weak and vulnerable in our society.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of complaints from parents in my area about the remedial system. There is still a stigma attached to remedial education. Some parents are extremely concerned that remedial teachers have not received proper training.</P>
      <P>I have had numerous complaints in this regard and I am aware of one case where two parents had to sit in the classroom with a teacher who was providing remedial education for their children because they felt the teacher was not providing them with a proper education. There will always be difficulties, but the resources must be put in place to provide teachers with proper training and back-up from the Department of Education and Science so they can give a proper education to children who need remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>I also have great difficulty with the number of unqualified substitute teachers in primary schools. There is a major crisis in this area and the Government must take action to ensure more students go into primary school teaching because the foundations of education are laid in primary school. Most of the resources should be given to primary school education and primary school teachers.</P>
      <P>There are many other issues to be resolved but one of my main concerns is the stigma some parents attach to remedial education. Many do not want their children to enter remedial education. The Department must provide parents with more information in this area. The lack of such information probably stems from poor communication between the Department and the teachers at the coalface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advise the Minister that for the first time in a <Col N="1199" /> long time the resources are available. He must prioritise where the resources should be spent. If that is done properly, the number of people who come through our educational system with literacy and numeracy problems will be greatly reduced.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Richard Bruton agus le Fine Gael as a gcuid ama a roinnt agus as an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála.</P>
      <P>It is ironic to hear the Taoiseach protesting about the ban on corporate donations to political parties being unconstitutional when Article 42 of the Constitution contains a clause stating that the State shall provide for free primary education. All of us who have been involved in teaching or as parents will know that clause is being breached by this Government. Fine Gael was also magnanimous in their acknowledgement that previous Governments have also failed in that regard. Apart from the literacy and numeracy issues which are critical, on an international basis our children are also seen as very unfit, both physically and mentally.</P>
      <P>In Balscadden national school in my constituency in Dublin North a small gym is being used as two classrooms. This adds to the pressure on pupils as well as on teachers. There are no plans in the Department of Education and Science for additional primary schools in Balbriggan, the population of which will increase from 9,000 to 25,000 in ten years. All these matters are interrelated and the Department needs to act more proactively and with the future in mind.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties with regard to caretakers. Teachers, who are not even able to do the work they are trained and qualified to do, have to do all sorts of handiwork in schools which is badly needed.</P>
      <P>Disadvantaged areas are hit most by teacher shortages. The workload on the remaining teachers is greater, fund raising duties are greater in disadvantaged areas, home school support is greater and there is a need for a greater special allowance for those who teach in areas of disadvantage. This also involves remedial teaching. The qualification is not rewarded sufficiently and there are not enough places where one can train to be a remedial teacher to ensure a sufficient supply of such teachers. Again, this comes back to numeracy and literacy problems.</P>
      <P>I have had complaints from teachers in Carlow, Kilkenny and countrywide who have been employed in a temporary capacity for 30 years or more. They do not have the opportunity to train and qualify so they can be paid properly and do the job which they feel they could do if they obtained the qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this debate, many of whom contributed very constructively. We carefully noted what they had to say.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt this Government, since taking office, has both identified the outstanding problems of education and has worked unstintingly to address them. Much has been done but much remains to be done. There remains a problem of poor levels of literacy, both in school leavers and across the population more generally. As a Government, we are keenly aware of this and that we cannot be complacent in this matter. We must keep up the pressure and the impetus for further development in this area. We must ensure that in the future no person fails to reach his or her full potential as a result of inadequate literacy and-or numeracy skills.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to tackle the problems of literacy and numeracy at all levels. All citizens must be equipped with the basic skills they need to allow them to participate fully in and contribute to society. As Minister of State with particular responsibilities in the area of adult education, I am acutely conscious of the importance of adult education and of the major work which remains for us to do in this regard.</P>
      <P>For that reason I have committed myself to tackling this problem during my period in office in the Department of Education and Science. The Minister, in his opening remarks, outlined what has been done in the area of adult literacy in recent years, and what is planned for the future. Initiatives include the tenfold increase in provision for adult literacy over and above the shameful provisions of less than £1 million per annum which we found in existence when we took office. There is a provision in the national development plan for an investment of £73.8 million in the coming years for adult literacy which will be supplemented by a £1 billion initiative under the back to education initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also taken a number of major initiatives in the area of adult literacy in the past, including the establishment of an adult literacy development fund to fund a range of pilot actions to test models and innovatory approaches which will inform future practice in this area, the increase in the number of clients being catered for on an annual basis from 5,000 to 13,000, the introduction of a number of innovative schemes to improve literacy, a very substantial expansion in staff development which is proceeding apace, literacy programmes through the media and an interdepartmental group on literacy for the unemployed, part of whose interim report is already being implemented. The White Paper on Adult Education, which I hope should be published later this month, will deal in a comprehen<Col N="1201" /> sive way with the Government's strategy on adult education, including adult literacy.</P>
    <P>However, adult education is only one manifestation of the literacy difficulties we currently face. Literacy difficulties begin in school and at pre-school level. Their solution can be found in the home, in pre-schools, in schools and in other educational establishments more generally.</P>

      <P>This is a comprehensive motion and Deputy Bruton deserves credit for the work he put into it. I thank the Minister for his general remarks. Statistics tell their own story. The first priority question today says that according to a survey carried out by Fine Gael, 44% of parents believe facilities are inadequate for special needs for children. Some 59% of people think the Taoiseach is telling lies about money, 69% think he is the greatest thing that ever happened and 89% think the appointment of Mr. O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank was a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State did not. I said 59% of the people think he is telling lies. That is what the Minister of State heard.</P>
      <P>Time is not on the Minister of State's side but he has the money and the resources to do an effective job in this area. There is no greater disgrace for politicians on all sides than to look into the eyes of a child and to see incomprehension and inability. I pay tribute to Mr. Ernie Sweeney from Castlebar who went through the primary school system illiterate, learned to read and has brought about an acceptance, in principle, by the Department of the Environment and Local Government that photographs should be used on ballot papers in all elections. It is a David <i>v.</i> Goliath situation where a young lad went through the school system and achieved this remarkable turnabout.</P>
      <P>The Constitution guarantees everybody standards in education and the Minister of State and his senior colleague, in the time left to them, can do an effective job in promoting facilities for disadvantaged children. Like in the duck race in Turlough last Sunday where all the little ducks were given numbers and the current brought them across the finish line, students doing the junior and leaving certificates today were also given numbers and some have struggled with Olympian competitiveness to be where they are and they deserve our gratitude and assistance and the Minister of State's co-operation. The future of this country will be built on the brain power of our young people who need the Minister of State's attention and the Department's co-operation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate because we cannot continue to ignore the signals that something is amiss in our education system &ndash; signals such as the high level of illiteracy and the low level of numeracy, which have been mentioned, the growing number of early school drop outs, the increased number of disruptive and, in some cases, uncontrollable children in our classrooms, the strong correlation between dropout and multiple disadvantage and the fact that more and more of our teenagers drink and do drugs at a younger age and more often than those in other European countries. We cannot ignore what teachers are saying about the frustration they feel when they see children dropping through the net, about how much of their time in the classroom is taken up with crowd control and about early burnout and their demands for early retirement. These are all symptoms of the same problem, which is that we are failing so many of our children and placing intolerable pressures on their teachers.</P>
      <P>On the need for training and retraining of teachers, at the moment the training colleges concentrate and equip teachers to teach the average child but not the child with learning difficulties. Teachers may succeed in recognising and identifying a problem early on but if they do not have the skills and the training to deal with those problems, it is of little use. It means that in many classes, the bottom one third of children learn little or nothing. In a classroom where that situation pertains, every child under achieves, and I suspect this pertains in more classes than we care to think about.</P>
      <P>Apart from training mainstream teachers, there is also a need for targeted intervention once a problem has been identified. For instance, if a child of seven or eight years has not learned to read, he or she will not learn to read despite the best will in the world on the part of the mainstream teacher. In a class of 28, a child will not learn to read if he has not done so by then. We should look to other countries to see what kind of system of targeted intervention we can put in place.</P>
      <P>The main problem, which has been mentioned again and again, is that of early identification of the problem. Before a teacher can do anything to help a child, he or she must know what the problem is. Assessment is not available and all schools are reporting difficulties in getting their children assessed. Even if they identify the problem, the waiting list is so long &ndash; it is sometimes years &ndash; by the time the child is assessed, the outcome is irrelevant because the child is probably at the drop out stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, a school in a disadvantaged area recently told me that it paid out £1,700 to have 13 children assessed because it had waited for so long for the Department to come up with this service. Out of sheer frustration, it was forced into this situation. This happens again and again throughout the country. It is completely unacceptable that disadvantaged communities <Col N="1203" /> should dig into community funds to have a child assessed, never mind doing anything about the problem when they are assessed.  I would go further and say that rather than have a psychological assessment on demand, which is the very minimum, there should be a national screening programme for children when they reach seven or eight years of age. It is far too late to assess children when they are doing their leaving or junior certificates. What can be done if they have failed at five, six, seven or eight years of age? Instead of an <i>ad hoc,</i> patchy system of assessment, there should be a national screening service which would give us the information required by the Department to make the decisions about the kind of resources needed.</P>

      <P>The contrast between the Minister's remarks last night and the real life stories told by up to 24 Deputies, who spoke in a very short period, speaks more loudly than anything else in this debate. The contrast could not have been more stark. The Minister came into the House and put a bulldog clip around 20 or 30 of his scripts of press releases and rolled out a soliloquy about programmes, planning groups, guidelines and curricula. The real danger is that perhaps the Minister believes his own rhetoric and that we are getting to grips with literacy and remediation problems in our system and the needs of children with special needs. That is not the reality and it goes to the core of the problem.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in our education system is that the Department and the Minister are so detached from the reality and they have sought to run our education system on a highly centralised model &ndash; an input, output model &ndash; that leaves them totally remote to the realities. One could not illustrate that more vividly other than by looking at the fact that there are 33,000 children with a special education need in our system. Unless they are in special schools, the Department does not know about them. It does not have a proper data base of their needs and what they are getting. If we asked the Minister how many children with special needs are getting services specified for them, he could not tell us; he could not answer that question. This Department has tried to run our education system remote from the reality. It is an input, output model. It is great for the 60% or 70% of children who do well; they will survive in any environment and we have excellent teachers who have helped them to survive and thrive in our education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is the child at the back of the class with a learning difficulty, whether dyslexia or attention deficit disorder, one has little chance and the Department does not have an answer. That was borne out time and time again in the individual, real life stories related by Members who contributed to the debate. Principals are expected to play God in schools throughout Ireland. Ten of their pupils may need assessment but they can only cater for three. They will play God and sel<Col N="1204" /> ect three while the other seven will just have to cope and take their chances in the classroom. It is not right in a time of plenty that principals should be put in such a position. That is what is happening in deprived areas in Dublin and around the country. Teachers and principals are trying to make decisions about children which affect their futures. They should never have to make those choices.</P>
    <P>Last night we heard about a mother on social welfare who had to dip into her own pocket to pay for an assessment of her child who had reached the age of 11 and was unable to read or write. Where is the just society to which we aspire in 2000 where a woman on social welfare must find £200 or £300 for such an assessment? There is no justice in that but the Department and the Minister will not give that mother the right to have the assessment carried out for free. They will not provide that legal right to which these parents should be entitled.</P>
    <P>The parents of children with special needs are seething with frustration. If the Minister attended any meeting where such parents are assembled he would blanch at their anxiety and frustration. Many parents give up their own precious time, of which they have so little, to attend meetings to explain what is happening. We recently conducted a survey of parents of children with special needs. The level of dissatisfaction and failure to provide services for these children whom we should cherish was frightening. There is a constitutional obligation on the State to cherish them, yet such children do not get the services which were specified for them in their assessment.</P>
    <P>Half the parents surveyed found that their children get almost none of the services that were specified for them in their assessment. Some 72% of parents said they were totally dissatisfied with the level of information available to them when their children were identified as having special needs while 40% were dissatisfied with the quality of the service provided. They found that only one in seven schools to which they presented their children had the resources to deliver a special service and only one in three schools even had information about the needs of such children. That is the reality on the ground and that is why parents are seething with anger. That must be addressed. Time and again the Minister and his predecessor when they had opportunities in the House, such as the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, to enshrine rights for those parents, such as the right to appeal when they do not obtain proper services, refused such approaches.</P>
    <P>That is happening today in this House and we must shake off this complacency. One does have to go back to our predecessors in more unenlightened times. If the Minister cared to do what I have done and surveyed parents of children with special needs to find out what is their attitude, he would find it instructive. That is the information which his officials will never present to him but he must expose himself to such information if he <Col N="1205" /> is to address the challenges and problems in this area.</P>
    <P>We examined speech therapy. A parent can expect eight minutes of speech therapy for his or her child in a majority of cases. The Department committed itself to a number of targets recently. In late 1996 it set a target that there would be no children with literacy problems at early primary level. The Government has done nothing about that and we are worse off than when the Department entered into that commitment. It has spent £800 million over the past three years on extra education services. I estimate that £30 million was allocated to children with special needs or literacy problems. Where are the priorities that the Minister set? The priority must be with those children who leave school early with poor literacy problems and end up unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Department will not present the radical <Col N="1206" /> options to the Minister which are needed. Legal rights are needed for the parents of children with special needs so that they do not end up interminably going to the High Court seeking rights for their children. We need to volunteer those rights to them and allocate resources to them. The lion's share of spending by the Department over the past three years has been on third level education. Third level students are predominantly privileged young people who can look to high income as the outcome of that spending. Where is the Minister's commitment to the children who will end up unemployed with poor reading skills, shut out time and again from a decent opportunity to partake in society? It is up to the Minister to make such commitments and I call on him to refocus his priorities and not roll out scripts from his Department's word processor which has happened time and again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the positive response which the new town renewal scheme evoked when I announced it last year. This Bill will provide a statutory framework for the scheme and enable it to come into operation. For the benefit of Deputies, I will outline the background to the scheme, the thinking behind it and the details of how it will operate within the framework the Government has established.</P>
      <P>There has been a decline in the core areas of our towns with people finding it more attractive to move to the surrounding countryside. The reality is that many of these towns now function largely as daytime service centres and with many vacant or under-utilised upper floors and even some derelict or vacant sites.</P>
      <P>We have all seen the impact which successive urban renewal schemes have made in transforming inner areas of our larger towns and cities which had been blighted by dereliction and decay over many decades. The expert advisory panel for the current urban renewal scheme noted that while smaller towns, that is, those with a population of less than 6,000, lacked the critical mass for the type of integrated social and economic approach adopted for that scheme, they nevertheless showed evidence of acute dereliction which warranted attention.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, Deputies on all sides of the House will be only too well aware of the type of decline in our smaller towns that I outlined. It was against this background that we decided to take a closer look at our smaller towns to craft a scheme that would meet their needs, having regard to their smaller population and size. While there are similarities between the new scheme and the current urban renewal scheme, we have endeavoured, in framing this legislation, to develop a concept of town renewal which is distinct from that of urban renewal which has operated in larger urban centres. The result is the town renewal scheme. It seeks to restore, consolidate and improve the built fabric of these towns, promote sensitive in-fill, particularly residential development, and to generally revitalise the towns at which the scheme is targeted. The scheme endeavours to put the heart back into smaller towns, making them once again attractive places in which to live, work and visit.</P>
      <P>As with previous similar schemes, the town renewal scheme is tax incentive-based and seeks to stimulate private investment in the revitalisation of areas which would not otherwise attract such investment. There is a strong emphasis on refurbishment and tackling key in-fill sites. The new conservation measures introduced by the Government will help to complement and underpin the efforts of county councils in meeting the objectives of their town renewal plans. The scheme also endeavours to achieve synergy with other State funded programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection of towns for designation will be undertaken in accordance with the principles and policies outlined in the Bill which relate to the detailed guidelines on which the town renewal <Col N="1209" /> plan approach is based. These include provisions for the selection of eligible towns and the preparation of town renewal plans in respect of these towns, setting out a strategic approach and vision for the town, as well as recommendations for specific designations. I also make provision for the seeking of expert advice to support informed decision making in this regard. This includes the expert panel process which was first introduced for the current urban renewal scheme and which has again been employed for the new scheme with a similar remit.</P>
    <P>One of the significant policy challenges to emerge in recent years is the need to ensure that cross-cutting issues are integrated into particular policy and programme development. This is especially the case where environmental considerations are concerned. The town renewal scheme must be viewed in the broader context of spatial planning policy, housing and infrastructural development and sustainability. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, mandated my Department to prepare a national spatial strategy which will be finalised by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>The strategy will be of crucial importance in translating the Government's policy on more balanced regional development into a detailed framework for spatial development over the long term. The strategy will set out an approach aimed at the attainment of better geographically balanced development. This will serve as a response to a situation where, despite a rapidly expanding economy, parts of both urban and rural regions are not realising their full potential. Another aim of the strategy is to strengthen links between urban centres of all sizes and to foster closer relationships between towns and the rural hinterland.</P>
    <P>Development must be balanced, but it must also be sustainable. I am confident that the new scheme will inject new life into the towns targeted, discourage the trend of moving to the surrounding countryside and stem the loss of shopping and other facilities to larger towns. We need to build sustainable, commercially thriving centres, while enhancing their environment and amenities, and the new scheme can achieve major progress towards reaching this goal.</P>
    <P>Sustainability is about people and catering for their needs. The Deputies are aware of the current pressures evident in the housing area. The combination of the generous tax incentives available under the scheme and the spare capacity in terms of infrastructural services will assist in the efficient provision of housing. The increase in housing supply which will come about as a result of this scheme will be of significant assistance in meeting the Government's objectives in this area. While the scheme is heavily focused on refurbishment, which is reflected in the more generous incentives available for that purpose, there is also scope for new build provided that 50% of such development is residential.</P>
    <P>Promoting maximum use of existing infrastructural resources is important at a time when the <Col N="1210" /> Government is embarking on a major programme of investment to combat Ireland's infrastructural deficit. We need more infrastructure but we must derive maximum benefit from our investment through using it effectively and, where possible, availing of infrastructural resources already there. The new scheme also dovetails neatly with other initiatives, such as the rural towns and villages initiative, which over the next three years will provide substantial investment in essential public water and sewerage facilities to smaller urban settlements with a view to combating rural depopulation and to encouraging development.</P>
    <P>As in previous schemes, the implementation of the town renewal scheme will depend on the legal provisions provided in this Bill and in the taxation measures already provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as inserted by the Finance Act, 2000. This Bill will enable the Minster, following an assessment process, to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance concerning the designations which should be made and that Minister's power to make such designations are already provided for in this year's Finance Act. Those reliefs cannot be applied until after the Oireachtas has passed a Bill providing for the renewal of towns or parts of towns identified on the basis of criteria drawn up by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Sections 1, 9 and 10 are standard provisions dealing with interpretation, expenses of the Minister and the Bill's Short Title and commencement of the Act. Section 1 is the interpretation section containing definitions of certain terms used in the Bill and also certain other standard provisions as to interpretation. In particular, it indicates requirements determining eligibility under the scheme. As laid down in the guidelines for the scheme which I published last year, a town must have a population of between 500 and 6,000, as contained in the most recently published census, and meet other conditions, such as towns or areas already enjoying the benefits of other similar tax incentive based schemes, that is, towns in areas designated under the 1999 urban renewal scheme, the seaside resorts scheme, the rural renewal scheme, and towns in the Dublin administrative area that were not eligible to participate in the new scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the Bill when enacted will be the Act of the Oireachtas referred to in section 372AA(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as inserted by this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the selection of towns for which town renewal plans are to be prepared, the format, preparation and contents of those plans and their submission to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. A county council may prepare a town renewal plan for an eligible town as defined in section 1 of the Bill or an area or areas of an eligible town within its functional area. To accommodate cases where towns straddle the boundaries of neighbouring counties, provision is also made to include a part <Col N="1211" /> or parts of the functional area of another county council, subject to the consent of the latter.</P>
    <P>A county council, when selecting an eligible town or an area or areas of an eligible town for the purposes of preparing a town renewal plan, must have regard to such criteria as may be specified in writing by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. In specifying criteria the Minister must have regard to the need for the promotion of physical renewal and revitalisation of towns, the promotion of towns as cultural, commercial, social and residential centres, the promotion of sustainable development patterns and the enhancement of the amenities, heritage and environment of towns. These policies and principles as outlined in section 3(3) underpin the guidelines issued for the scheme.</P>
    <P>While subsection (3) deals with the selection of towns, subsection (4) relates to the preparation of a town's renewal plan and requires county councils when preparing town renewal plans to have regard to criteria specified by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. In addition to the principles outlined for subsection (3), criteria may also be set for the format and content of a town renewal plan, design considerations, selection of buildings and areas for the application of specified tax reliefs and for consultation procedures. Section 3(5) provides that guidelines setting out the criteria I referred to in relation to subsections (3) and (4), the selection of towns and the preparation of towns renewal plans may be made and published.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (6) a town renewal plan must consist of a written statement and a plan setting out objectives for the renewal on a sustainable basis of the area to which the plan relates and for improvements in that area's physical environment. Subsection (7) sets out a range of issues which a town renewal plan may address. These include the renewal, preservation, conservation, restoration, development or redevelopment of the townscape, layout and building pattern of the area, including facades of buildings and shop frontages; the restoration, refurbishment, consolidation and improvement of the building fabric of the area; the density of the development and the treatment of spaces between buildings, the preservation and protection of natural, architectural and archaeological heritage; the development or redevelopment for residential or other appropriate use of derelict sites or vacant sites or buildings or parts of buildings, the promotion of sustainable development patterns, including the protection and improvement of the environment and amenities, the removal of barriers to development and the enhanced use of infrastructural capacity.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that a county council may consult with interested parties and shall have regard to any submissions made to the council during those consultations. Section 4 deals with the consultative process by the Minister. Provision is made for the Minister to consult and <Col N="1212" /> seek the advice of such persons as appear to him or her to have relevant expertise in town renewal and, in relation to town renewal and town renewal plans, have regard to any such advice submitted. The section provides in addition that any person giving such advice in relation to town renewal shall advise the Minister of any interest they hold and shall not provide any advice in respect of such interest. As Deputies are aware, I have established an expert advisory panel made up of persons with expertise in the area of town renewal and this panel is currently examining the various town renewal plans submitted by county councils.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the functions of county councils and the criteria which must be taken into account in the making of recommendations that areas be qualifying areas for the purposes of town renewal tax reliefs. The reliefs relate to expenditure on the conversion of existing buildings for use as rented residential accommodation, expenditure on the refurbishment of a house for use as rented residential accommodation and allowances to owner occupiers in respect of certain expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of residential accommodation. Section 23 type relief for new rented accommodation would only apply where this was considered justified.</P>
    <P>This section also contains a provision allowing residential incentives to be applied throughout an area to which a town renewal plan relates. This is similar to a provision contained in urban renewal legislation and has been framed to take account of Government policy on house prices by confining this option to conversion or refurbishment of existing property in the case of section 23 type relief for rented residential accommodation and to residential property for owner occupation. While provision for this area wide application of residential incentives has been included in the Bill, it did not form part of the current scheme. However, as this legislation will provide the framework for future town renewal schemes, I consider it appropriate to include this option to cover its possible use in the future.</P>
    <P>There is provision in this year's Finance Act for the application of a range of commercial and industrial incentives based on 100% capital allowances. These are similar to what is available under the current urban renewal scheme. However, these incentives must be notified to and approved by the EU Commission before they can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The criteria to which a county council must have regard in making any recommendation contained in or accompanying a town renewal plan are also set out and are as follows &ndash; consistency between the types of development likely to be carried out in the areas to which the recommendations relate and relevant objectives of the plan; the significance of the recommendations for attaining the objectives of the plan; market conditions in the area or areas concerned in relation to the supply of and anticipated demand for the relevant types of development and the nature and <Col N="1213" /> extent of any impediments to the carrying out of the relevant types of development.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that having considered a town renewal plan submitted under section 3 and any recommendations contained in or accompanying such plan as provided for under section 5 and any advice provided to the Minister under section 4, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may recommend to the Minister for Finance that an area or areas may qualify for tax incentives.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that developments qualifying for the tax reliefs must be consistent with the objectives of the relevant town renewal plan, with county councils providing certificates to this effect. Section 8 provides for arrangements to monitor the implementation of town renewal plans and to report the results of such monitoring to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Such monitoring must be in accordance with any guidelines the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may issue from time to time for the purposes of the section. Subsection (2) provides that county councils must furnish reports to the Minister on the outcome of the monitoring.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is a standard provision enabling the expenses of the Minister in administering the Act to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 10 sets out the Short Title and commencement dates of the Bill. Section 2 provides that sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be deemed to have come into operation on 16 February 1999. This would give validation to the preparatory work already carried out to date, including the establishment and operation of the expert advisory panel, the preparation of guidelines for the scheme and the selection of towns and the preparation and submission of town renewal plans by county councils. Other provisions shall come into operation on such day or days as may be appointed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>This scheme represents an opportunity for the smaller towns, the back bone of rural Ireland, to avail of the type of incentives that have been successful in reviving and regenerating our cities and larger urban areas. It is another element in an integrated set of policies which the Government is promoting to ensure that the benefits of our strong economic growth are spread as widely as possible. It provides an opportunity to support and develop smaller integrated communities. It has potential to relieve pressure on our larger urban centres and bring life back to smaller towns. It is practical, realistic and designed to bring a good return to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The process of examining the town renewal plan submitted is now well advanced and the expert panel is expected to complete its work shortly. In all, a total of 102 plans were submitted and I hope to be in a position to announce the designations next month. The scheme, by its nature, will be based on a targetted approach in <Col N="1214" /> terms of areas to be designated for tax incentives. It is not the intention to designate wide areas within individual towns as that would defeat the purpose of the scheme. However, we must await the finalisation of the expert panel's deliberations who will then make recommendations to me. Only then can the decisions be announced.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's press statement on the Bill dated 29 May he made outrageously over-blown claims for this legislation and he has done so again today. On 29 May he said that the town renewal scheme must be seen as another element in an integrated set of policies which the Government is promoting. He claimed:</P>
      <P>We now have a coherent strategy which will address the issues of social and economic under-development in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>He went on to state: &ldquo;This scheme must also be viewed in the broader context of spatial planning policy&rdquo; and that it will also have a key part to play in the Government's current strategies to tackle the shortages of housing supply.</P>
      <P>We had further echoes of that today in a most brazen presentation of this Bill which is designed to cover the Government's back for things it has already done and allows the Minister to make a series of good news announcements late next month if all goes well. It is a sloppy and slip-shod way of going about it as I intend to demonstrate. Legislating in this way is an abuse of the legislative process. The Minister is bringing in legislative cover for a process which has already taken place and has led to a list of 102 towns being submitted to the Minister. We are not quite sure what is to be done with it as the Minister did not explain that. The selection, examination of the criteria, local consultations, proposals and so on have been done and, in order to cover all this, there is a provision which states that three sections of the Bill will be deemed to have been in operation since 19 February last year. If that is not an abuse of the legislative process I do not know what is. The Minister should be ashamed to come into the House with this legislation seeking to act retrospectively to cover what has already been done. If the Government was serious about the Bill and about having a real debate on town renewal, we would have had this Bill in February or March last year and could have legislated knowing what was there and perhaps improving the process in which county councils and town representatives have already engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke in glowing terms in his press release and today about how important this measure will be in the context of a spatial strategy. I remind him that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, went to a good deal of trouble, because he had to, to explain that we will not have a spatial strategy until the end of next year at the earliest. We are going through <Col N="1215" /> an elaborate and painstaking process to build it up. Consultations are being held widely in a special unit in the Department charged with that, yet the Minister of State can say the measures in the Bill are a key part of a spatial strategy that has not yet been put together. What kind of strategy is that? He does not know what the strategy is but he can tell us this Bill is a part of it.</P>
    <P>Apparently these measures are part of an integrated rural development strategy. I wonder if the Minister of State has reflected on how these town development plans awaiting a decision by the Minister or the Minister for Finance fit in with the respective county development plans. Do they fit in at all? Are they part of area plans that are in turn part of a county development plan? Is this not simply a much more opportunistic approach to town development? How does this scheme fit in with anything we have painstakingly dealt with in our discussion on the Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill? I do not believe the Minister has given a moment's thought to that yet he can pretend this is part of an integrated rural development strategy when it is nothing of the kind. It is an opportunistic and short-term reaction to a problem. The Government saw a measure that worked in some areas and has now decided to try it a few more times. In order to save itself bother and potential political flack it will not make all the proposals but will ask the county councils to do so.</P>
    <P>If I thought this was a real exercise in subsidiarity and county councils were being given a role in deciding on the pattern of development, I would be happy. However, that is not what is happening. Each county council was told it could propose a certain number of towns. When they have been proposed it is open to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Finance to decide which towns get the green light to go ahead. The county councils propose but who selects? I am still not clear on that. The Bill states the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will make recommendations to the Minister for Finance and he, in the context of the Taxes Consolidation Bill and so on, decides on the designations. It gives the Minister for Finance patronage that has only been paralleled by one other scheme in the history of this State &ndash; the previous town development scheme to which the Minister referred. We have turned the Minister for Finance into a little god who will decide which and how many of the 102 towns proposed by county councils will get this largesse.</P>
    <P>I have no ill feeling towards any of those towns but it is not a proper process to legislate to give an arbitrary power of that kind to the Minister for Finance. I made that point when we debated the last Bill that dealt with this and the Government, of course, refused to accept that there was anything arbitrary in this at all. Arbitrary powers are being given to a member of the Government and they are not made any less arbitrary by the <Col N="1216" /> fact that county councils have been consulted and that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government can make recommendations. Legally the final power to make the designations resides in the hands of the Minister for Finance. That is not a coherent strategy for rural development or anything else. It is sloppy, slipshod, opportunistic legislation and it is not the way to go about proper development.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is part of a coherent strategy, and the Minister for Finance, in his wisdom, decides that town X is going to benefit from designation, and at the end of next year the bones of a spatial development strategy are in place, and it turns out that town X is not designated as one of the focus points for development as defined in the spatial strategy, will town X be deprived of the benefits of designation under this scheme? Not on your nelly. One can be sure that will not happen. The Government is blithely anticipating, and even prejudicing, what it might do in terms of a spatial development strategy. A spatial development strategy has been unnecessarily delayed by this exercise in the pluperfection of consultation and analysis designed only to delay the day when difficult decisions have to be made about development strategy.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes along with another idle pretence. He said that the measures in the Bill will have a key part to play in the Government's current strategy to tackle the shortage in housing supply. He repeated that today when he said that the increase in housing supply that will come about as a result of this scheme will be of significant assistance in meeting the Government's objectives in this area. Who is he kidding? Who is the Minister trying to fool when he says that? How many new residential units will be brought on stream as a result of this Bill? How will they compare to the 40,000 new housing units per annum that we were previously said to require, an estimate which will be increased when the next Bacon report is published? What number will qualify as a key contribution to achieving such a target? How can the Minister pretend that is going to make a key contribution to solving our housing problem? He would be well advised to read the explanatory memorandum of the Bill before he makes a statement like that.</P>
    <P>In the section dealing with the financial and staffing implications the Bill states, &ldquo;. . . the cost to the Exchequer should not be excessive having regard to the size of the towns involved and the relatively small scale investment projects which are likely to arise under the scheme.&rdquo; If I ever saw a balloon being burst or an own goal being scored, that is one. This key contribution to our housing problem is unlikely to have excessive cost because of the small scale investment projects which are likely to arise under the scheme. Would the Minister ever cop himself on and stop going on with nonsensical claims when his own document tells us how empty and overblown those claims are?</P>
    <P>This Bill, the Minister claims, will help in the <Col N="1217" /> promotion of sustainable development patterns. When I saw that I could not resist a wry grin. Deputy Gilmore and I had to fight hard, and were in the end unsuccessful, to get a reference to sustainable development into the Planning and Development Bill. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government refused consistently to put any reference to sustainable development in there because he felt it was not definable. Now, however, we have Solomon, in the form of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, talking about sustainable development. He even goes on to say what sustainable development is. Here is a real gem. The Minister said that sustainability is about people and catering for their needs. That may sound like grand, down-home, homespun philosophy but that is not what anyone involved in the debate about sustainable development understands by the term. I have never heard such rubbish, yet the Minister tells us this Bill will be an important factor in sustainable development. That is not sustainability in the sense of today's debate. To pretend that a small measure like this will be important in that context is idle in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Section 6 talks of the protection of architectural heritage. I am glad it does. Again, Deputy Gilmore and I, with more success this time, had to fight very hard to get any reference to the protection of architectural heritage into the Planning and Development Bill. It is one point in the Bill which pleased me.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the role of this Bill and these measures in the development of towns. Is there any provision in the scheme, because I do not see it in the Bill and I did not hear it mentioned in the Minister's statement, to co-ordinate what is being proposed with the provision of adequate water supplies and sewerage services and other amenities to the towns involved? We are talking about towns with populations of between 500 and 6,000. For the last two years the Minister has been unable to give me a target date by which an end would be put to the discharge of raw effluent from town systems into our watercourses. I get responses telling me what the target phases are for towns of different sizes in European Union directives but the Minister cannot give a date by which we will no longer be discharging raw sewage from small towns into watercourses. This Bill is going to be a key part of our development strategy but there is no reference in it in any way to the co-ordination of infrastructural investment other than the specific types of investment provided for in the tax breaks set out in it.</P>
    <P>The scheme is entirely arbitrary in who makes the decisions. I said on the previous Bill about a scheme of this kind, and I repeat now, that there is no guarantee that a town that conforms to the criteria set out in the Bill will achieve designation. The Minister of State underlined that point when he stated:</P>
    <P>The selection of towns for designation will be undertaken in accordance with the principles and policies outlined in the Bill which <Col N="1218" /> relate to the detailed guidelines on which the town renewal plan approach is based. These include provisions for the selection of eligible towns, and the preparation of town renewal plans in respect of these towns . . . </P>
    <P>A list of these towns was thoughtfully provided in the appendix to the Minister of State's press statement on 29 May. As I understand it &ndash; if I am wrong the Minister of State may correct me &ndash; there is no guarantee that any of the towns on the list will receive a designation. The Minister for Finance, on advice received from the expert advisory panel and that of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will peruse the list and decide which of the 102 towns will be designated. Will one, two or three towns in a county receive a designation or will any town receive it?</P>
    <P>What the Minister asked the towns and county councils to do has involved no small effort on their part. As far as I am aware, the county councils took this matter seriously. In my county more than five towns &ndash; the number the county council was asked to put forward &ndash; wished to be considered for designation. The county council set about making a decision and many councillors swallowed hard and agreed to the proposals put before them. This shows that when local authorities are trusted to do a reasonable job they will do it. However, there is no guarantee that any or all of the five towns chosen will receive a designation.</P>
    <P>The number of towns which will receive a designation is decided by the Minister for Finance in light of advice he receives. We do not know the nature of the advice he will receive. Will the advice of the expert advisory panel be made available to us or to the people in the towns concerned, either those designated or those not designated? Will it be made available to the county councils or the planning authorities which have the obligation of providing the other kinds of infrastructure which are required to support development in these towns? The legislation is silent on that point which means that the Minister has no intention of informing us about the nature or tenor of the advice he receives. A series of arbitrary decisions will be made about the towns which will benefit from this designation.</P>
    <P>Why were the county councils asked to propose a specific number of towns? That invitation flies in the face of the kind of system set out in the Bill, which outlines a series of criteria which must be taken into account in constructing and judging these plans. There might be more towns in a given county which could conform to those criteria. However, Kildare County Council, for example, was informed that it should propose five towns for designation and other county councils were given similar instructions. No reference was made to the current status of these towns or to the hierarchy of needs or of stages of development which might exist between them. Kildare County Council was told to nominate five towns <Col N="1219" /> and God in Merrion Street would make the final decision.</P>
    <P>On what basis was the number of towns each county was obliged to propose for designation decided? Who was responsible for that decision? Is there any explanation for counties not being allowed to nominate more or fewer towns? The answer is that no such explanation exists because the scheme is completely, utterly, totally and irremediably arbitrary.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that county councils may consult with interested parties and may have regard to submissions. There is an atmosphere of falsity about our solemnly legislating in respect of this matter when we know that action has already been taken. The county councils which were asked to nominate towns have, to my knowledge, taken their job seriously. Most of them established a series of travelling clinics for consultation with interest groups in the towns they wished to consider. A series of meetings were held, people were given information about the contents of the Bill, they reflected on this and returned with proposals and suggestions. The entire process has been completed. However, we are now solemnly legislating in respect of that process. The Bill states that sections 3, 4 and 5 are deemed to have come into effect on 16 February last year. We are informing county councils that we are providing a legislative basis for a process they have already completed. This, again, is an abuse of the legislative process.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the Minister to consult people with relevant expertise. Was this done? It appears so. Who was consulted? Who are the members of the expert advisory panel and what advice have they provided? Is it intended that these people should provide solemn advice in respect of each individual town? Will they be familiar with the towns in question? I do not know these people but I wish to know if they are the kind of individuals who were responsible for producing a proposal on the Pigeon House docks area in respect of which one of yesterday's newspapers published a report.</P>
    <P>The newspaper article to which I refer reported that a 30 storey glazed circular tower would be built as part of a £230 million office scheme plan for Ringsend. I accept that this plan does not come within the scope of the scheme outlined in the Bill. It does, however, involve town planning. According to the report, the Ringsend plan will involve the construction of 16 office blocks which will include a 30 storey circular tower. Planning has already been applied for in respect of this development which makes provision for 1.38 million square feet of office space and a hotel, 20,000 square feet of retail space, 55,000 square feet of conference and ancillary facilities and over 2,000 car parking spaces. It is stated that the development will not shadow a residential area.</P>
    <P>The development to which I refer goes hand in hand with the commercial development at Spencer Dock which requires the provision of 2.2 mill<Col N="1220" /> ion square feet of space. The article states that it will replicate the East Point business park, where the final three blocks are to be completed next year to bring the overall size of the complex up to 1.1 million square feet. It also states that the city planners are likely to look favourably on the south bank proposal since it will help the city to compete against the suburban business parks which have sprung up in south, west and north Dublin.</P>
    <P>If that is the concept of urban development being pursued, we are doomed to experience the most appalling gridlock this country has ever witnessed. In three major areas of Dublin's docklands, we are intent on building more office blocks, conference centres, places for people to work and car parks and encouraging thousands more people to drive thousands more cars to work each morning and home again in the evening, thereby adding to traffic congestion. What we should be doing in those areas is encouraging residential development so that people will leave those areas each morning to travel to work elsewhere in the city and return to them each evening. This will create some kind of counterflow and ensure that more efficient use is made of road space and public transport facilities.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of advice that experts on the advisory panel are going to give, on a smaller scale, in respect of these town development plans. If the concept of development to which I referred continues to be pursued, a mess will be made of towns which, as the Minister of State romantically noted, could be made into havens in which people will want to live rather than into places from which they will want to escape to live in the surrounding countryside. If that is the logic informing the kind of development the Minister is attempting to stimulate, he is completely on the wrong track. This view, which is part of the disease from which the country suffers, makes sustainable development a totally theoretical pipe dream rather than offering us any new notion of sustainability.</P>
    <P>The Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government and the county councils can recommend areas for designation. There is a provision in this Bill that either parts of an area or an entire area can be designated. I am aware that there is another reason for that which need not detain us now. Will the Minister always accept the recommendations made to him and will the expert advisory panel comprise people who can identify the main requirements in towns? For example, I am aware of one case where proposals have been made for a tax designation area. Car parking space is required in the town, yet one of the key sites which would unlock access to a substantial amount of car parking space has not been designated. The person who owns the property is saying &ldquo;If I can't get designation for that site, you can't get access to car parking to improve the situation in the town.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the expert advisory panel will be located but it would appear that it will be <Col N="1221" /> somewhat removed from the above considerations and that we may find a number of designation projects &ndash; especially if only parts of areas are to be designated &ndash; which, with the best will in the world and the considerable wisdom at his disposal, the Minister for Finance and his expert advisory group will not be able to identify. These matters are not always obvious from maps. I wonder what kind of checks will be put in place to identify what the net effect of designation decisions will be.</P>
    <P>Even when our deified Minister for Finance and other Ministers make conclusions about designation, that will not be the final word on the matter. It will be necessary to go to the European Commission in Brussels to get final clearance. I am not aware of what the Minister's expectations of success there are and I would like him to inform us of those. There has been at least one major case in this city which was in considerable doubt for a long time because the Commission apparently was not in favour of it. I would like to know what soundings have been taken and what the Minister's best guess is as to how this will be viewed in Brussels.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, there will be a large number of disappointed towns which, the Minister for Finance, in his wisdom, will decide should not be included in the designation. It seems equally likely that some towns which will be designated will also be disappointed because the mandarins in Brussels will rule against them. There are many questions to be asked about this issue and I would like the Minister to answer some of them when he concludes the Second Stage debate. Otherwise, we will be faced with a very time consuming job on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the renewal of small towns throughout this country. If this Bill had been presented to the House before the Minister announced the tax incentive scheme for the renewal of small towns last year, we would certainly have given it a very warm welcome, notwithstanding the quibbles we may have had about some of its details. Nobody likes to be taken for granted and it is a mark of the Government's arrogance that it has taken this legislative assembly for granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final line of this Bill is one of the most extraordinary legislative provisions to appear before the House in a long time. Section 10(3) &ndash; of a ten section Bill &ndash; states: &ldquo;<i>Sections 3, 4, 5</i> and <i>6 </i>shall be deemed to have come into operation on 16 February, 1999. &ldquo; Today is 8 June 2000. Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 outline the procedures for the adoption of town renewal plans. Section 3 provides for the adoption of town renewal plans by county councils and outlines the procedures to be followed when plans are being adopted. It also provides that the Minister may make guidelines which county councils will have to follow and outlines the required content of such guidelines. Section 4 provides that the Minister, when drawing up guidelines and considering matters relating <Col N="1222" /> to town renewal, can consult with outside people and outlines the manner in which he should do so. It also states that the people whom the Minister consults should not have an interest in the matters in regard to which they are providing advice. Section 5 provides that county councils may make recommendations about which towns or parts of towns should receive tax designation and section 6 goes on to authorise the Minister to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance about the tax designations.</P>
    <P>The procedure outlined in these sections is quite detailed and forms the heart of the Bill. Then, at the very end of section 10, the Minister asks this House to pretend that the procedure has been in place for the past 17 months. This is a legislative joke. It is not possible to introduce a Bill which outlines a procedure stipulating that county councils must consider design, cultural, social, residential, economic and other requirements in towns and that the Minister must follow certain criteria and subsequently ask people to close their eyes and pretend that all of these provisions have been in place since 16 February 1999. In the meantime, the Minister announced the scheme and has received applications from county councils for 102 towns, in regard to which we are to pretend the legislation was in place and the procedure followed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not about the renewal of towns throughout this country, rather it is about the renewal of the life of this Government. This Bill asks the House to give the Government and its Ministers a licence to spend the next few months hawking around the towns selected by the Minister for Finance, under a procedure we are to pretend has been in existence for 18 months, arranging press conferences and saying &ldquo;We're breathing life back into your town.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill is about the next election, not the renewal of towns. It is insulting to this House to come before it, as the Minister has done today, and ask its Members to effect that kind of retrospection. It is one thing for a Government to come into the House with legislation when some loophole inadvertently appears, where, for example, a court case exposes an area of public activity to challenge and where it is necessary to introduce validating legislation, but to come into the House with legislation which is not complicated, could have been drafted in a weekend and could easily have been presented before the tax incentive scheme was announced last year, and to pretend that it has been there since the beginning of 1999 is not acceptable. While agreeing with the principles set down in the Bill and to its provisions and procedures for the town renewal schemes, the House should not agree to apply this legislation retrospectively to 16 February 1999. The Minister should explain why the legislation was not introduced before he announced the scheme in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is in favour of the renewal of small towns. Small towns have been neglected and the hearts of some of them have gone into <Col N="1223" /> dereliction. The commercial areas of many towns have gone into decline, commercial activity in many of the smaller towns has been sucked into the larger urban centres, the physical appearance of many towns has deteriorated and sometimes the population has stagnated or declined. We have seen a pattern of banks closing branches and schools, small hospitals, Garda stations and post offices closing down.</P>
    <P>The small towns of Ireland have enormous potential. They have the potential to address our crisis in housing and to provide good places for people to live and work. If they are to provide people with a good quality of life it is essential that they have all the facilities and amenities which people expect. Many small towns already have that infrastructure and if it is protected and developed they have enormous potential. However, it is not enough to make a town pretty in order to breathe life into it. Nor is it enough to introduce a town renewal plan along the lines of this Bill, to prettify the main street of the town and provide tax reliefs for the conversion of an old warehouse into a block of apartments, for example. A concerted effort must be made to ensure that the basic facilities of towns are maintained. There is no point in converting an old warehouse into apartments if, at the same time, the Department of Education and Science removes the marginal teacher from the school, the health board closes the hospital, the Garda station moves elsewhere and the bank closes its branch. Serious efforts must be made to ensure that the essential amenities of towns are kept intact. In towns that have been selected for renewal, State agencies should not close down post offices and Garda stations, schools should be adequately resourced and capable of providing an acceptable range of subjects and the planning process should be used to prevent private institutions, such as banks, from closing a branch in a small town while seeking planning permission to extend one in larger town.</P>
    <P>Renewal of small towns must be examined in the context of rural development and spatial planning. Of course, the spatial plan is still something of a Government pipe dream We must consider the town in the context of the district or part of the county in which it is located. There is merit in looking at towns in groups. A number of towns and their rural hinterland may be capable of providing a facility which could not be sustained in an individual town. Some consideration should be given to the grouping of towns where the provision of essential facilities is required.</P>
    <P>If smaller towns are to develop and provide an acceptable quality of life, good public transport must be provided. Outside the major urban areas there is a serious deficit in the provision of public transport. It is important that public transport be provided to link smaller towns with larger urban <Col N="1224" /> centres. This question must be examined in the context of town renewal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to sustainability. We must look at town renewal and urban renewal in general in the longer term. Urban renewal schemes have brought a positive benefit to the areas where they have operated. They have physically upgraded urban areas and have provided much welcome development and general improvement of towns and cities. However, one or two things now need to be reviewed. Some town centre urban renewal schemes have become clichéd and very jaded. The typical cobbled pedestrian area bounded by black metal bollards, overhanging lamp standards, little parking bays and wooden boxes of flowers were all very interesting and attractive when they first appeared but they are becoming a bit of a bore. Every town with an urban, town or village renewal scheme has exactly the same black metal bollards, paving and hanging baskets.</P>
    <P>It appears that no attempt is being made to develop the individual characters of the towns themselves. The same fake old world shop fronts appear everywhere. It is time to look at this aspect of urban renewal. We are creating a type of urban renewal theme park in every little town in the country which, within a couple of years, will look extremely jaded and which in some of the earlier ones looks jaded already. It is time some consideration was given to individuality and developing the character of the town rather than trying to create Little England villages in every Irish town. It is similar with some of the economic developments which have taken place. There must be a craft shop, a little tea shop and the same apartment development in the old warehouse. How sustainable will these developments be after the period of tax relief expires? That needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the omission in the Bill of the entire county of Dublin. The three county council areas, Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, are excluded from the Bill. I remind the Minister that there are towns in these areas which are not part of larger conurbations. That is certainly the case in Fingal. One thinks immediately of towns such as Skerries, Balbriggan, Lusk and Rush. In South Dublin one thinks of towns such as Newcastle and Rathcoole. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, there are, perhaps, not so many, but there are places such as Stepaside. One could even argue that the towns which have now become part of the suburban development should also be examined in their own right because these towns, such as Dundrum, Stillorgan or Tallaght, were towns in their own right before larger suburban developments took place around them. In excluding the three county council areas in Dublin, the Bill is anti-Dublin.</P>
    <P>If there are to be schemes for urban renewal in villages and towns and on a larger scale, we need <Col N="1225" /> to have a scheme of suburban renewal, either by the inclusion of the three Dublin county council areas in the Bill or by the introduction of separate legislation which will address their special needs. One should not have to wait until areas become derelict before the issue of urban or town renewal becomes live. If attention is given to suburban areas which are being deliberately excluded from the remit of this legislation, perhaps we will not repeat the problems which occurred in smaller towns which now have to be addressed by way of a special town renewal scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I welcome the legislation. Like some of my colleagues, I am a member of a local authority. We were asked to evaluate submissions under the urban renewal scheme and, in doing so, we were asked to underscore our value as public representatives for the people from the various areas and we were faced with very difficult choices. An invidious task was delegated to members of local authorities which was to decide which areas would and would not be included. Despite that, the process proved that local representatives, who are often much maligned, could rise to the occasion and rise above the petty politics of which they are often accused and make valuable contributions to the evaluation process at local level. They proved their worth in that, while they might have argued strongly for the inclusion of certain areas and despite the fact that many councillors found their areas excluded, the overall common good ultimately guided their decisions.</P>
      <P>I am delighted an attempt is being made to tackle dereliction in towns throughout the country. It is important to bring life back to them, because they have lost out to the major towns. There has been a move from the countryside and I have spoken about this in the context of rural degeneration and the need to have a vigorous policy of rural regeneration and renewal. This refers specifically to rural towns outside the larger urban centres. The Bill is welcome in that respect and I would support it in that regard. It is an attempt to reverse what appeared to be an irreversible process where people were moving to the larger urban centres and the towns on the periphery were being denuded of population. As a consequence, services came under threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, seems to be in an obstinate mood and he sometimes makes decisions which bear no relation to reality. I do not know how, in the renewal scheme brought in for the Shannon catchment area, he could have excluded the largest area attached to the Shannon, which is the Inny basin area in north County Westmeath. Senator Cassidy spends a great deal of time telling us on Westmeath County Council that the area has suffered a 30% fall in population. This <Col N="1226" /> scheme was designed to address and reverse this process, but the Minister would not listen. I presume Senator Cassidy did his job and fought for the inclusion of this area which stretches from Street to Lismacaffry to Lisryan to Coole to Castlepollard to Multyfarnham to Rathowen to my area of Ballynacarrigy. I assume he impressed upon the Minister for Finance the necessity of including this area in the Shannon basin scheme, but it did not happen. Not one blade of grass in County Westmeath was included.</P>
    <P>A village such as Rathowen highlights the result of this. The village is near the border with County Longford, all of which, I was delighted to see, was included in the scheme. We needed to ensure the population is maintained in north Westmeath and this scheme would have made a major contribution. However, when arbitrary lines are drawn on maps, a reverse flow can be created which can have major consequences for areas such as this part of Westmeath. I will continue to highlight this point to ensure a wrong is rectified as quickly as possible and that the defined area of the Inny basin is included as part of the Shannon catchment area scheme which introduced tax incentives in the general Shannon area. As Labour Party spokesperson on Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, I spoke with the Minister for Finance long before a decision was made and I raised the issue at every committee meeting.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the previous urban renewal scheme posed a difficulty for councillors and certain criteria were laid down under it. The population parameters allowed for towns up to 6,000 people. Under those criteria, five towns in County Westmeath qualified to be considered &ndash; Kinnegad, Rochfortbridge, Castlepollard, Kilbeggan and Moate. The criteria further stated that, if a county had fewer than six qualifying towns, only three could be selected. Unfortunately, Kinnegad and Rochfortbridge, two very important towns on the N4 and N6, lost out. I was disappointed because Kinnegad is the gateway to the west and north-west as well as being the entry point into Westmeath, so we are very proud of it. We thought it was ideal for renewal. It was based on a population which, I think, was based on 1996 central statistics.</P>
    <P>That was the first flaw because if places such as Kinnegad and Delvin in the surrounding hinterland could have been considered, it would have ensured Westmeath County Council would have been in a position to put forward the fourth or fifth town but it was not because the population parameters were confined to 1996. They were three years out of date. One has to have an objective standard or measurement but they were three years out of date, and that created the first headache. It was the first lacuna in the criteria.</P>
    <P>To compound that, there was great disappointment in Kinnegad and Rochfordbridge and a very <Col N="1227" /> strong argument could be made for Delvin in north Westmeath, one of those areas that it is very important to promote to ensure the reversal of the drop in population and the demographic changes. As my colleague, Deputy Gilmore said, we must focus on the implications for the services, churches, football teams, post offices, Garda stations and schools because, with the drop in population, all those services come under threat.</P>
    <P>That was a mistake but the real mistake was that we took our responsibility seriously. We went through the vetting or evaluation process and then picked the towns. They were designated without extra resources and a very senior planner was delegated to draw up the plans which were submitted to the Minister's Department and on which people expected results in April, but they have not received results to date. The Minister set up an expert committee which is reviewing the matter. Legitimate expectations are built up at several levels, including council level. We have dealt with that and two or three of our towns were disappointed. Then the planner has to examine areas and everybody submits an area. Some people are disappointed in a town when the planners say that somewhere else is a more suitable area for refurbishment or whatever.</P>
    <P>The committee set up by the Minister might say that some matters are not as we had intended, and there is further disappointment. Then the matter goes to the Minister and the Minister for Finance and then to Brussels. There will be tranches of disappointment along the way for some people. That is a worrying feature and that is why the legislation should have come first. We put the cart before the horse and we have to make the hard decisions, as we have shown that we could.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the thrust of this scheme seems to be aimed at refurbishment, which is good, rather than involving construction and knocking down everything in a place. We need to preserve the heritage and the best of the buildings. Refurbishment is a good way to proceed and is to be supported.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that, while this scheme is coming into place for towns, it is essential that commercial ventures such as banks are not allowed, willy-nilly, to withdraw the services they were supplying to those rural towns, based on commercial decisions.</P>

      <P>There is not an ounce of social thought or value and certainly no charity in the banks. All they consider is the bottom line. If there is not a profit margin in it, they withdraw. Again, I remind the Minister of the obstinacy and obduracy of the Minister for Finance who would not meet the credit unions, which are based on the co-operative ideal of Horace Plunkett. The Minister should ensure that he meets them <Col N="1228" /> because they will be the people to provide the financial services eventually for the elderly people about whom we worry, people we advise to take their money out from under the mattress if they have a few pounds to pay for their burial and put it into those institutions. That is what we should be encouraging and that is why the Minister for Finance should get down from his high horse and meet the credit unions. He should ensure they provide services for those great commercial bodies that many people in the free market zone would praise but for which I would not have much time. They flee at the first sign that their bottom line economics does not add up. They are answerable to all the big institutional investors at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The other scheme is the village renewal scheme, on which everybody can take a bow, including the Minister and his Department. It is a very good scheme which caters for many villages. Look at the villages in my own county, from the bridge of Finea to the bridge of Athlone, to the bridge at Baile na Carraige and the bridge at Kinnegad. For a small amount of money, a positive cost benefit analysis could be carried out which would be worth evaluating. Again, the Minister gave some autonomy and money to the local authority. The local authority consulted in the five electoral areas in the county and discussed the matter with the local tidy towns committees or the local development associations. That is value for money. One did not have to carry out audits. All one had to do was drive into any village countrywide to see the benefits of that scheme. I hope more funding can be provided for that scheme which should be extended and enhanced.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Town Renewal Bill, 2000, and I consider it a privilege to speak on it. I praise the Minister for coming forward with this legislation which I can say, coming from a mixed rural constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, will be a great boost for those counties. When I speak about improvements for Laois and Offaly, it is only a microcosm of what will apply in the rest of the country. I know when I refer to examples locally that they can be mirrored in every other county or constituency countrywide.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, in a nutshell, is to provide a framework for a new town renewal scheme aimed at the physical renewal of smaller towns, that is, those with a population of between 500 and 6,000 people. The scheme is a tax incentive based scheme and is aimed at revitalising these smaller towns, promoting sustainable development patterns, fostering balanced rural development, combating dereliction and promoting towns that benefit under this scheme as commercial and social centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I have been waiting for legislation on this matter since I was elected to Dáil Éireann almost three years ago because it has been a burning issue in many small rural towns countrywide for many years. Before I speak specifically on the Bill, I will trace the origins of the scheme. Many years ago, special tax incentives were introduced for areas such as Temple Bar and the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin city. They were outstanding successes and revitalised those areas. The scheme was so good that immediately urban renewal and development schemes were introduced which allowed for major tax incentives throughout the vast majority of the main provincial towns &ndash; we call them county towns in most areas &ndash; for example, Portlaoise and Tullamore in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Now it is the chance of the smaller town with a population of between 500 and 6,000 to benefit from these schemes. We are very pleased that they are now receiving recognition. Before the last general election, many people raised the issue with me throughout my constituency. They acknowledge the outstanding work of the tax incentive scheme in Portlaoise. All one has to do is look at the centres of these main towns which are successful, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Those schemes have been great value for money. The Exchequer did not have to provide the money.</P>
    <P>The only cost to the Exchequer is tax forgone and with the excellent tax receipts, that is something with which currently we can justifiably cope. Private investment is putting in the funds for the redevelopment and refurbishment of these areas and they have been an outstanding success. They were such a success, however, that they started to hoover up money, keeping financial resources from the smaller rural towns. For example, if a person living in one of the smaller towns in any of these counties or even somebody living in a rural area had additional income, wanted to invest it wisely and prudently and to get a return on their investment, they were almost obliged to go to Portlaoise or their county town and invest in residential developments, in a flat or a housing complex in that town. That was very good for Portlaoise and it is to be recommended but it had the side effect of drawing money out of the rural areas and reinvesting it in major urban areas. Ultimately, that was a loss to the local areas and people there saw funds flow into the major towns.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that under this new scheme 102 town renewal plans have been prepared by the various county councils and have been submitted to the Department for examination. This will give these 102 towns a chance to have their day and to benefit as other major urban areas have benefited in the past. In my area of County Laois, Mountrath, my own town, Rathdowney, Portarlington and Mountmellick are included and in County Offaly, Clara, Ferbane, Edenderry and Banagher are included in this scheme. This will be a great opportunity for people in these towns. Many of the derelict building sites, shops and run <Col N="1230" /> down premises have been there for the past ten, 15 to 20 years with weeds growing through roofs, with bird nests, etc. This will be an opportunity for people to invest their money and, through the taxation system, get tax incentives on their investment.</P>
    <P>This is a clear example of the Government's commitment to balance rural development. It is part of the core of the national development plan. In relation to the national development plan, we are now embarking on a national spatial strategy and a key element is that we will be looking at the major urban areas, how they relate to the smaller towns and the relationships with the rural hinterland. The spatial strategy is a two way street. We should not look at the towns and the relationships with rural areas only; we should also look at it from the perspective of the rural areas in the first place because many of the major towns depend on a thriving rural economy as well. It should not only be one way traffic. One third of the population lives in Dublin, one third lives in the major urban areas and one third or one million lives in rural areas and they must be taken into account in this national spatial strategy which I expect will be the case when this plan is finalised by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and in which the Minister will be directly involved.</P>
    <P>This scheme was announced last July. I was elected to Laois County Council for the first time last summer. Within a couple of weeks of being elected to Laois County Council, I was delighted to hear the Minister of State's announcement on this town's renewal scheme. The content of the scheme is perfect and I am very pleased with all the details of the scheme. Aside from the details, I had some problems with it in relation to my role as a councillor. I would like to contrast it with what Deputy Penrose said about County Westmeath. I corresponded with the Minister last summer and he clarified the queries I raised at that time. In relation to the scheme, it is an executive function of the county manager to select the towns in each county and to draw up the town renewal plans. As a newly elected councillor who had stood for election on the basis that we would have some influence on how things operate at county level &ndash; we all speak about increasing the powers of democratically elected people &ndash; I was bitterly disappointed to find that we did not have a role in finalising and making decisions when it came to selecting the towns. I know the new local government Bill, which will be published and will pass through the Dáil, will attempt to give more power to the democratically elected representatives and that is the way it should be because we are the people who stand for election and if we get it wrong, the people can turf us out. That is what democracy is all about.</P>
    <P>I have to differ with Deputy Penrose in County Westmeath. We share the same midlands Radio 3 station and there was much confusion in the midlands about who had the final say in this matter. I am adamant &ndash; I ask the Minister to correct <Col N="1231" /> me if I am wrong &ndash; that it is a managerial function and there is no mention of elected representatives in the guidelines. The Minister clarified this and asked that councillors be consulted and I am happy that was done. It is not the Minister's fault that councillors did not have a say in the first instance but rather the way local government is run.</P>
    <P>What appears to have happened in County Westmeath is that the county manager adopted a different approach. It is appears Deputy Penrose did not know that he did not have the final say. The county manager in County Westmeath apparently handed this over to the elected representatives, let them make the hard decisions, as Deputy Penrose eloquently said they did, and accepted those decisions. It was not a decision for the members but the manager was happy to be guided by them. Other managers had the right and the authority to make the decisions as they saw fit.</P>
    <P>I am happy that there was sufficient consultation in County Laois. The point I make is that locally elected representatives need more power because we live in a democracy. In County Laois, seven or eight towns were available and the planning officer made a submission to us. He did not do so strictly on the basis of population but, collectively, we saw the merit and went along with the recommendation which was submitted to the Department in due course. When it came to drawing up the town development plans, we insisted on public consultation. We took on two junior planning staff to map the streets and photograph all the derelict buildings and invited people to come to the local library, whether in Rathdowney or Mountrath, for an information session. Leaflets were put through doors by the local authority and we had an outstanding turnout of property owners in each area who wanted to find out the details of the scheme so that they could then make submissions to the local authority. That was done and councillors had a role in that regard but it was by way of consultation only.</P>
    <P>Again, there was confusion last summer and I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying it as the summer went on. There is a lesson to be learned in this regard. There was confusion in my county about the area which could be included under the town renewal scheme. Word was that the maximum area to be included was three hectares and that it was to be reduced proportionately in towns with fewer than 6,000 people. I read the guidelines and was satisfied that the three hectares rule &ndash; it does not have to be an exact proportional reduction &ndash; applied only to new buildings. No specific ceiling was placed on refurbishment. Some planning officers and county managers genuinely got that wrong last summer. They read the three hectares rule and thought that the total area for a town with a population of 6,000 was three hectares and <Col N="1232" /> included new buildings and refurbishment. I understand that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The moral of the story is that in future when a major new scheme is being introduced, I would like a seminar to be held for councillors so that we could be briefed directly. We rely on the senior staff in our county councils for briefing and information. It was only because some of us were Members of this House and had direct access to the Minister and the Department that we were able to find out that some planning officers did not fully understand the details of the scheme. They fully accepted that point when it was highlighted and clarified by the Department. In future, I would like seminars held for councillors on these issues. I stress that I am not in any way critical of the scheme; I am totally in favour of it. Some of my comments are probably more appropriate to the reform of local government because they relate to the role of county councillors.</P>
    <P>Towns have been selected and 102 towns are being examined by the Department. The town renewal plans are being drawn up in detail and the expert advisory panel has been examining these since last January. The Minister of State said that he will announce the designations next month. When he is making those announcements, I ask him to supply Members with maps and codes showing the tax incentives available to each building because it will involve a very complicated matrix in each town. The town renewal plan had to specify whether a building would be used for commercial, office, retail or residential purposes, whether it was a new or refurbished building or whether it would be leased for residential purposes. There will be a very intricate matrix and there is no point giving us the map showing us what is included if we do not know the category of incentives which will apply to each area. I accept there will be much work involved but it will have to be done if we are to have valuable information so that when the announcement is made, we can sell the scheme in a positive manner as is our job and one which I will be proud to do. However, I can only do a good job if I have the information in front of me. If one quotes the wrong incentive for a property, one will hear about it for a long time. I look forward with great interest to the detailed information in the Minister of State's announcement next month.</P>
    <P>The scheme will last for three years and mechanisms to monitor it are provided for in the Bill. I would like it monitored in two ways. The Department will review the acreage in each area which is developed annually as a result of these incentives and I ask that the Revenue Commissioners provide an estimate of the revenue foregone as a result of the tax incentives in these areas. I am sure it will be an outstanding success as it has all the ingredients and hallmarks of an excellent scheme.</P>
    <P>The areas in the towns are small but they will be the catalysts for development in such towns. When ten or 15 properties are developed around the old square or main street, which will breathe <Col N="1233" /> life into the town, it will encourage others to invest. The incentives available under the scheme were discussed in detail during the passage of the Finance Bill, 2000. I am a member of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service and I thank the Minister for Finance for accepting an amendment of mine relating to this scheme and incorporating it into the Finance Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>Certain types of business activities will be excluded for tax incentive purposes under the scheme but the Finance Bill, 2000, when published, excluded premises which primarily promoted agricultural products. That could have meant that a local hardware shop which did a great deal of trade with the local agricultural community could have been seriously jeopardised. The Minister immediately took that on board and sought to amend the scheme. That resulted in a parallel amendment to the urban renewal scheme and various other schemes because the Finance Bill, 2000, provided for a scheme similar to previous schemes.</P>
    <P>The reference to promoting agricultural products may not have been relevant when the original legislation was drafted for Temple Bar or the IFSC, but that anomaly could have created a problem for small towns in rural Ireland. The Minister gratefully took that on board. He also excluded under the scheme premises that are used mainly for financial services and sought to clarify the position in regard to accountancy practices which are located on the main streets of many towns. I was happy that he undertook to do so because it would have led to confusion if it had not been addressed.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore in regard to <i>pro forma</i> town renewal schemes comprising cobblelock stone and little black metal bollards. I ask planners throughout the country not to repeat such schemes in every town. Cobblelocks will be removed in years to come. Thirty years ago the fashion was crazy paving. We spent ten years putting it down, ten years looking at it and another ten taking it up. The same will happen in regard to cobblelocking. It will eventually be taken up because it is the fashion of the day. A long-term strategic view is not taken. Consultants who advise in this area take what worked in a town in England, plonk it into one in Ireland and transfer the model from county to county. We are foolishly aping what happens elsewhere. We should always examine the individual characteristics of towns because they should have a unique identity, of which we should be proud.</P>
    <P>Overall, the scheme is substantially geared towards physical redevelopment and refurbishment. It is not similar to urban renewal schemes, which involve major integrated social plans. It relates to small towns, communities and populations which do not have the problems that must be addressed by urban renewal schemes. The Bill is excellent and the sooner it passes through the House and is implemented the better.</P>
    <P>Some tax incentives must be approved by the EU and I ask that the Department of Finance applies all haste in ensuring that is done. It is proposed to apply for the residential incentives <Col N="1234" /> initially but the clarification and approval from EU for commercial incentives should be obtained as soon as possible. The Bill will give effect to all the work that has been carried out since last summer in identifying towns and drawing up plans and the examination of same by the expert advisory panel on behalf of the Minister. All that work has been done so that when the legislation is passed the schemes will be up and running quickly.</P>
    <P>Some areas have inevitably been left out on this occasion. This scheme will be a success and in a year or two the Minister and the Department should consider extending it to areas with populations above 500 and continuing it for a further three years in those areas where it is a success. It will not cost the Exchequer directly, although corporation tax will be foregone. However, the Government will obtain excellent value for money in these local areas and the schemes will bring people back and breathe life into small rural towns which have been in decline in recent years.</P>
    <P>Village renewal schemes should also be extended. Tremendous work has been carried out in small rural areas and they have provided excellent value for money. The message is at the end of the day the closer one gets to the people on the ground, the greater is the value for money for the Exchequer from such schemes, and that will be the case with this scheme. I am confident that in years to come we will be in the House saying that it was an outstanding scheme and Members on all sides of the House will call for it to be repeated.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the early passage of this legislation. I hope it is on the Statute Book before the summer recess. The scheme is too important to leave over until after the summer. I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government and Opposition Whips to ensure that it is passed in the interests of the 102 small towns. If these schemes are fully operational by 1 August we will have achieved a tremendous amount of work in this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation, which is a positive development. I endorse the last sentiments expressed by the previous speaker. I hope the Bill will travel quickly through the House and will be passed before the end of the session. It is fundamentally important that it is implemented as soon as possible. As a public representative, I was in the ideal position when the Minister designated only one town in my constituency and, therefore, was not faced with a difficult choice. I will refer later to the reason other areas were not designated. However, the county town of Roscommon was designated. It had been neglected under the urban renewal scheme because its population was under 5,000, although it had been included in the previous scheme which was a huge <Col N="1235" /> success. It rejuvenated the entire town and I hope when the Minister of State considers the proposals put forward by various towns, Roscommon town will receive approval.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for the scheme emphasise that priority should be given to towns where the aims and objectives of the scheme achieve the targets in the legislation. Under Roscommon County Council's submission to the Department, Roscommon town fulfils all the criteria, including the attractiveness of the town as a place to live, the potential to generate residential use in the town centre, the availability of opportunities within the town centre to enhance the commercial and social life of the town and there is no doubt that the infrastructural capacity exists to meet future development. There is also potential to further improve the heritage of the town.</P>
      <P>The heritage of County Roscommon is surpassed by few other counties. Roscommon was the traditional capital of Connacht but that has moved further west. I hope every consideration is given to that proposal. The previous urban renewal scheme for Roscommon town was a huge success and was of major benefit to the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Education and Science I would be seriously concerned that any parent of a special needs child should feel that the needs of his or child are not being adequately addressed. Since taking office, the Government has undertaken an unprecedented level of development in special education services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from a Government decision in October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their disability or location. The response in question may take the form of resource teacher support or child care support or both, depending on the needs involved. Already, as a result of this development, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has been increased from 104 in October 1998 to 450 at present. The number of special need assistants helping children with special needs in the primary system has been increased from 299 to 1,095 over the same period. <Col N="1236" /> My Department will continue to allocate further resources in response to identified needs.</P>
    <P>In addition, the special pupil-teacher ratios applicable to all special schools and special classes catering for children with special needs has been reduced to the level recommended by the special education review committee. Also, since September 1999, the remedial teacher service has been extended to every first and second level school in the country with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. Schools with lower ratios are free to apply to my Department for remedial support where they can demonstrate a need for the service.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency was formally established with effect from 1 September 1999. This service is being developed on a phased basis over five years with the objective of ensuring that all schools will have access to the service before the end of 2004. As part of this process, the number of psychologists in the service will be increased from 43 to almost 100 by next September.</P>
    <P>While these developments constitute a major advance in the quality of our special educational services, I fully recognise that much work remains to be done, especially where the parents of children with special needs are concerned. I will be anxious that the system be made more responsive and supportive.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>In this connection, I would point out that a planning group is currently finalising work in my Department on an overall review of our approach to special education services. The remit of the group is to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all levels of the education system for students with special needs. I expect to receive the report from the group in the near future and I assure the House that I will respond as positively as possible to any proposals which will contribute to supporting children with special needs and their parents.</P>

      <P>Does it surprise the Minister that 44% of parents report that almost none of the support services identified in assessment are being provided? Does it also surprise him that in relation to those children, even a small number of them, who receive speech therapy services, one third of them are getting less than ten minutes per week while the balance are getting less than half an hour per week? Does he accept children with learning and speech difficulties cannot possibly have their needs met in ten minutes, which is barely time to sit down and get settled in, let alone address serious language or communication difficulties?</P>

      <P>For example, I am not sure if there is a confusion between the health services and educational services and I appreciate there is a need for improvement on the health service side. The Minister for Health and Children understands that and is trying to do something about it.</P>
      <P>On the education side, there is no question but that the increase of 1,142 people assisting in the period since the end of 1998 is very substantial. I have said there is more to be done, but never before in the history of the State has there been such an increase. The people I meet from school to school are delighted with it and, like me, they realise that there is more to be done.</P>

Is he aware that there is seething anger among many parents? Does he not agree that it is ludicrous that the Department of Education and Science is providing education services and is dependent on an over-stretched health board for speech therapy services in many counties where the service is nil? I have been advised by Deputy Naughten that this is the case in County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that parents should have the statutory right to appeal cases where the service is not provided to their children? Such a right was denied by the previous Minister. It was announced on his departure from office last January, but that is the last we have heard of it. Does he not agree that we must seriously commit speech therapy resources, survey real needs and put legal rights in place? Does he accept that those are the minimum measures we need to undertake?</P>

      <P>Following its consultation with various interests in the field, the Higher Education Authority has recently submitted a report to my Department on the proposal to establish a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin. The authority concludes that there is a strong case for the establishment of the centre. I have previously indicated that I am favourably disposed to such a centre, however, a number of practical issues need further clarification and my officials have commenced discussions with the authority in this regard. These issues relate to the appropriate structure and financing for the centre, the implications for the overall budgetary provision, the question of possible overlaps with other initiatives and the need for co-ordination.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this proposal has been in the pipeline for several years and that there is not a centre of excellence for deaf education studies? In view of that, will he give an undertaking to give priority to this proposal? As well as being in the pipeline for some time in terms of lobbying by the deaf community, the Higher Education Authority considered it for some time. Will he undertake to make a final decision within the next three months on agreeing to the proposal in principle and then agreeing the detail, which is being worked out at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>An amount of £5 million was provided in the 1999 budget to provide grants to schools that set up and run after school child care services. My Department is currently formulating details of a scheme for an after school support service in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which has also been allocated £5 million to support community based groups to develop after school child care services in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that my Department's scheme will be confined to schools in disadvantaged areas. In the case of the primary sector, schools will be selected on the basis of criteria being developed by the Educational Research Centre for the new, more targeted child centred programme being introduced following a survey of all primary schools. Selection at second level would generally be based on retention levels and may be linked to the current stay-in-school retention initiative. The grant to each school would cover the cost of a co-ordinator and other personnel and would include other operating costs such as insurance, heating and lighting. It is envisaged that this scheme will be operational in the schools selected by September next.</P>
      <P>My Department has also provided £2.3 million this year for child care to support access of participants to Youthreach, Traveller training centre programmes for early school leavers and the vocational training opportunities scheme for unemployed people. The funds are allocated to the vocational education committees for direct provision of crèches, the purchase of places on existing commercial or community crèches and for the payment of childminders, subject to compliance with tax and registration requirements under the Child Care Acts. The schemes will further enhance the package of initiatives introduced in December 1999 to combat educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>Precisely how many schools does the Minister propose will have child care facilities on an after hours basis? My rough calculation suggests 150 schools would be involved, although there are 4,000 schools in the country. Will he agree that a major untapped resource in <Col N="1240" /> schools could be made available after hours on a wide-ranging basis if insurance and other related costs were met?

Regarding second level schools, it will operate on the basis of retention levels. A total of 48 schools have been selected for the second level stay-in-school initiative and more will be selected shortly, bringing the total to over 100. I do not have a figure for the primary level, but, obviously, at least as many schools will be involved. I agree with the Deputy about the importance of this area. We must find the right method of implementing it. The community and local bodies must be involved. A comprehensive package is required.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department has refused to participate directly in the local drug task forces despite the many requests to do so; the plans he plans he has for a strengthened role for his Department in the task forces and for the education sector generally in the battle against drugs, especially having regard to the increased number of heroin related deaths in recent weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is fully committed to the overall aim of the Government's drugs policy which is to provide an effective, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse. As part of this process, my Department is represented at senior level on the national drugs strategy team and on the interdepartmental group which, in turn, reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion of which I am a member.</P>
      <P>In relation to representation on the local drugs task forces, the areas covered by the task forces correspond to a great extent to areas covered by the area based partnerships. The educational issues of concern to the drugs task forces are also the concern of the education sub-committees of the partnerships. My Department is represented on each partnership and also provides the funding for full-time and part-time education co-ordinators to support the work of the partnerships. In the circumstances, given the need for co-operation and integration at local level, my Department proposed that its representation on the drugs task forces be provided by the education co-ordinators of the partnerships. This is a reasonable and workable arrangement.</P>
      <P>My Department has taken a number of initiatives in the fight against drugs. A programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools was developed by my Department in consultation with the partners in education and all other relevant interests. This programme is called Walk Tall and its dissemination commenced in January 1999. It has now been introduced to 2,150 primary schools, which represents approximately 67% of primary schools. The funds provided for the dissemination in 1999 amounted to £500,000 and a similar amount has been provided in 2000 to continue the process.</P>
      <P>At second level, the substance misuse prevention programme, On My Own Two Feet, has been introduced in approximately 570 post primary schools. This represents 75% of the total number of post primary schools.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information</i>A total of £70,000 was spent on this programme in 1999. In addition, it is planned that social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE &ndash; including substance misuse prevention education, will be phased into all schools at junior cycle over a three year period, beginning in September 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of my Department in the fight against drugs is further strengthened by the young people's facilities and services fund. An Exchequer contribution of approximately £35 million over three years has been set aside for this fund which was established by the Government in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the pro<Col N="1242" /> vision of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that poor educational achievement and early school leaving are definite characteristics of the vast majority of heroin users? Does he, therefore, also accept that tackling educational disadvantage could have a significant impact in terms of tackling the drugs issue? For this reason, does he accept it is important that a senior representative of his Department is a member of each of the drugs task forces? Does he accept the case being made by all the drugs task forces in their request, which the Minister refused, for a senior representative of the Department? The purpose of this request is to educate senior representatives from the Department of Education and Science on the issues surrounding disadvantage and drug use because of the poor response to date from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that early school leaving and poor education are related to drug abuse. Disadvantage is a major problem in that area. I will bear that general syndrome in mind regarding the programme designed to tackle disadvantage which will be implemented soon. The policy up to this point has been to have personnel on the area based partnerships which also represent the Department on the drugs groups.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases there is now a new way of doing business where decisions are taken through a bottom-up approach, not diktats issued by the Department. Is the Minister aware that in education there has been a great deal of effort at community level to tackle disadvantage and drug abuse? The Minister should respond positively to demands made at local community level. Is he aware that in the second plan currently being prepared by the drugs task forces a vast amount of money is being earmarked for community educational initiatives to compensate for the inadequacies in mainstream educational services? Does he accept this is an indictment of the education system? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a recent OECD publication, Education at a Glance 2000. Ireland participated in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS, which was conducted in more than 40 countries during the school year 1994-95. The survey was conducted on eighth grade pupils which, in the Irish context, involved mostly second level pupils in first or second year.  A moderate degree of absenteeism among eighth grade pupils was taken to be 5% as a basis of comparison. Ireland and Australia had a 7% rate of absenteeism, the third highest among the countries surveyed. High levels of student absenteeism can have a negative effect on a student's opportunity to learn and may be harmful to a student's learning achievement. In Ireland's case, the mean mathematics achievement in the test was higher in those schools which had a lower absenteeism rate, less than 5%, than in other schools reporting absenteeism rates greater than 5%. This was similar to most countries. Nevertheless, the mean mathematics achievement in Ireland was 527 against an OECD mean of 524 and this ranked Ireland as seventh among the participating countries.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about high levels of absenteeism. There are, however, a number of factors contributing to absenteeism, including educational disadvantage. Since 1995 a number of initiatives have been taken to assist schools serving disadvantaged areas improve many aspects of their learning environment. These initiatives would be expected to result in improved attendance among disadvantaged students. These initiatives include an extension of the home-school-community liaison scheme, enhanced capitation for all second level schools serving disadvantaged areas, the introduction of the eight to 15 early school leavers' initiative and the stay in school retention initiative, improved resources to schools in terms of teacher allocation and capital resources and school development planning. There was also the leaving certificate applied and various other developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>In addition, the junior certificate school pro<Col N="1244" /> gramme was introduced to provide an alternative junior cycle curriculum for pupils who might otherwise leave school. I announced recently my intention to expand this scheme on a phased basis to all interested schools. The leaving certificate applied is now available in more than 200 schools and centres to meet the needs of those who find the leaving certificate and leaving certificate vocational programme unsuitable.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill is before the Oireachtas at present. It will provide the statutory underpinning for a new structure and framework to tackle the causes and symptoms of school absenteeism. The National Educational Welfare Board will co-ordinate the activities of all those involved in so far as they relate to matters connected with school attendance. The board will identify the causes of poor school attendance by certain children and the adoption of measures for its prevention.</P>
    <P>The issue of absenteeism is not a simple one and in order to successfully address the issue, the approaches employed must be wide-ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment. I have outlined the major steps being taken to address the issue and I am confident those steps will provide the basis for developing and refining strategies to counter school non-attendance in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us a good summary of the report but he forgot to mention the decline in GDP spend on education. Perhaps he might do so in his next reply.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister believe it is acceptable that 25% of children in disadvantaged communities are regularly absent from school? What does he propose to do about that? What supports does the Department intend to put in place to ensure these children do not fall out of the system? What discussions, if any, has the Minister had with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act which is not being enforced? Schools do not know about the Act. What will the Minister do to ensure they are made aware of it so that children will be protected from falling asleep at the back of the classroom every Monday morning?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned some of the initiatives taken so far, although they have not had much time to have had an effect. They are good initiatives which have been useful where they have been applied. Some 24,000 pupils applied for courses such as the leaving certificate applied. That figure has doubled in the past ten years. These initiat<Col N="1245" /> ives, such as the stay in school retention initiative, are good and we must build on them. The allocation of funds for the disadvantaged will give me an opportunity to strengthen and target that work. I hope to do that during the summer so we will be ready to roll in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the importance the Government attaches to the issue of educational disadvantage and school retention. A wide range of supports for schools serving areas of disadvantage have been put in place in recent years. These supports reflect my emphasis on preventative actions and positive discrimination in favour of young people at risk of early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The projects strand of the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. Central to this initiative is the establishment of local consortia comprising school personnel and local representatives of other statutory and voluntary agencies. These engage in the integrated provision of in-school and out-of-school supports for young people at risk of educational disadvantage and for their families. Some 1,200 young people are involved in the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and are being supported by the various actions that have been put in place in the projects. I have already decided to extend the 17 projects for a further phase. Submissions for funding for the period from 1 July next until 31 August 2002 are being assessed in my Department at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also put in place the stay in school retention initiative at second level. This marks a <Col N="1246" /> significant departure from traditional policy in that funding is being granted to schools on the basis of plans which they are being helped to design themselves. My Department employs two national co-ordinators to assist participating schools in formulating their retention plans and targets. In the initial phase of the initiative, 57 schools accepted my Department's invitation to participate in the scheme and funding of almost £1.5 million was committed to these schools at the end of 1999. I recently announced a major expansion of this initiative and at the end of May a further 59 schools were invited to participate in the second phase. I will arrange to let the Deputy have a list of the schools participating in the initiative together with their enrolments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>No study has been carried out specifically for this purpose. An international adult literacy survey conducted in 1995 and published in 1997 provided a profile of the literacy skills of adults aged 16 to 64. About 25% of the Irish population was found to score at the lowest level, level 1, performing at best tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text, with no distracting information and when the structure of the text assists the task. The survey showed the ratio of unemployed to employed people scoring at the lowest literacy level in the Irish survey was 2:1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental group has been examining how best the literacy service can cater for the <Col N="1248" /> unemployed. It comprises various Departments, FÁS, the National Adult Literacy Agency, local employment services and literacy providers. An interim report has been submitted to Government.</P>
    <P>In addition, funding for adult literacy has increased from a base of £850,000 in 1997 to £7.825 million in 2000, plus an additional £960,000 for programme development. Referral networks have been established on an area basis, involving a number of key actors in that area. Innovative approaches are being expanded, for example, family literacy groups involving both adults and their children. A quality framework has been developed and nationally certified in-service programmes for staff are being implemented. The Department has commissioned the production of a TV series in literacy awareness and tuition for adults. Initiatives are being implemented over a three to five year period to address the literacy needs of deaf people and people in Gaeltacht areas who require tuition through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>As a result of these initiatives, the number of clients catered for on an annual basis by the literacy service has increased from 5,000 prior to the OECD survey published in 1997 to 13,000 at the end of 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the literacy level among the unemployed is far greater than the 25% which is the average for the population? Is he aware that an early school leaver is ten times more likely to be unemployed than someone who completes second level education? Is he further aware that almost 100% of small firms with serious recruitment difficulties state the reason is those seeking the jobs lack basic literacy, numeracy and interpersonal skills? What programmes is he putting in place to target the long-term unemployed and ensure they have these skills?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and all that is implicit in the survey. No doubt the Deputy will agree with me that the provision of £850,000 per annum for the literacy service under his Government was derisory. In the last budget implemented by that Government the provision was increased by a grand total of £60,000. That is approximately £1,700 for every VEC. It was a disgraceful provision. We have increased the literacy provision tenfold. We have put an adult literacy development fund in place and introduced other initiatives. In the next few weeks we will have a White Paper on adult education which will indicate the Government's proposals to build on its considerable achievements. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is conducting a study on issues relating to employability. I do not know if it is considering literacy as one of those issues but I will discuss the matter with it.</P>

Will the <Col N="1249" /> Minister of State consider doing what the British Government has done and provide an intensively supported literacy service for the unemployed and integrate it with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs? If that was done, literacy services would be available in a timely manner to those who are made redundant or unemployed, ensuring that those trying to re-enter the labour force would have high literacy skills. Significant grants should be made available, over and above social welfare payments, to those who would participate in such schemes. Does the Minister accept that this is the way to make this accessible and worthwhile?</P>

New initiatives to encourage them into the education system, before specifically targeting literacy, should be focused on as well.

We have our own ideas and I have specific proposals in that area which will be announced shortly.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A survey of science facilities was conducted during the winter of 1998-9 to determine the state of the existing science infrastructure within second level schools and to inform decisions concerning the optimum approach to targeting resources at schools that offer the physical science subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is planned to publish an executive summary of the main findings of the survey later in the summer. The survey revealed three key findings. First, it identified the inadequate levels of equipment within science laboratories. In particular, it was noted that the vast majority of the 628 responding schools do not use information technology facilities in the teaching of science subjects. Second, the survey identified the need for greater awareness concerning health and safety issues within science laboratories. Third, the survey demonstrated that there is a need to upgrade <Col N="1250" /> the services within the majority of science laboratories.</P>
    <P>In response to the main findings of the survey, I have already sanctioned the payment of a grant of £2,500 to schools that offer the physical science subjects at leaving certificate level for the purpose of acquiring a multi-media PC with DVD drive, printer and related hardware and software. Additionally, I sanctioned the payment of a grant of £1.500 to all qualifying schools to be used for acquiring items of equipment for use in the laboratory. I am at present considering a range of additional measures aimed at enhancing the level of equipment within science laboratories.</P>
    <P>Concerning health and safety issues within laboratories, a circular letter has issued to the managerial authorities of all schools reminding school authorities of their statutory obligation under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, to have a safety statement in place and to ensure that there are adequate safety precautions and safety equipment in science laboratories.</P>
    <P>Schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project. For all other schools that offer science subjects, consideration is being given to the most appropriate mechanisms to fund an upgrade of services within laboratories in the context of the overall needs of the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the most interesting finding of the study was that 65% of schools indicated that the laboratory facilities were hopelessly inadequate? Will the Minister provide information to the Oireachtas Library which shows the situation in all-girl schools, where it is well known that laboratory facilities are far worse and the take up of science is correspondingly very depressed? Will he publish, either directly or under the Freedom of Information Act, the full survey so the Oireachtas can look at it? Does he agree that the £13 million provision over three years for 780 schools represents about £16,000 per school? What does he believe a school can do by way of an adequate science facility with £16,000? Does he think that will bring us up to best international practice?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the lack of science facilities at second level has a major impact on the uptake of science courses at third level?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that lives are being put at risk in schools? It is a miracle that there has not been a serious accident in light of the fact that the majority of science laboratories have no fire extinguisher, smoke detector, first aid kit or fire blanket, as is highlighted in the Minister's own report. Another report states that there are unwanted chemicals in unlabelled containers being stored in school laboratories. These are hazardous chemicals. The teachers do not know what they are or how to treat injuries caused by them. What will the Minister do about those two serious safety issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned in my reply that letters concerning health and safety obligations have been sent to the schools in question and that extra funds have been granted to improve equipment. In relation to the lack of facilities affecting those who take up science, that is not the key problem. There are schools with poor facilities and large numbers doing science while other schools have every facility but very few are studying science. I was a scientist and we only had very simple facilities but we were able to do the most elaborate experiments.</P>
      <P>It is an area on which we must concentrate. Science laboratories need equipment and I see that as a priority. I will secure whatever resources I can for it.</P>

Does the Minister agree that if we are to embrace those who are disadvantaged in our schools the committee should already be providing advice in respect of the programme of spending he intends to undertake?

      <P>Deputies Bruton, Shortall and others have outlined the urgent priorities which exist and the importance of making adequate investment.

I have no difficulty in proceeding with the establishment of the committee and as soon as the Dáil goes into recess for the summer I will get a great deal of work done.

We enacted legislation which made provision for the establishment of a committee on educational disadvantage and we expected this to be put in place immediately.

      <P>The reports to which the Deputy refers were undertaken by Professor Malcolm Skilbeck and Dr. Helen Connell on behalf of the Higher Education Authority and were published last month. They acknowledge the growing movement to advance equity in higher education and note that considerable progress has been made, notably through the substantial quantitative growth of third level places and the establishment of a greater diversity of institutions and programmes in recent decades. However, the reports note the continued serious under-representation of lower socio-economic groups, the limited success of women in climbing the career ladder in academia and the significant barriers facing students with disabilities. They also outline the range of barriers facing each target group and consider the range of policy responses across the international community.</P>
      <P>In setting out a range of propositions to increase equity in higher education, Professor Skilbeck comments that there is no single solution to the problem. I welcome the publication of these reports, which set a context for our higher education institutions to develop policies in relation to equity and access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our higher education institutions have statutory obligations to promote equality both in terms of gender equality and in terms of equality of opportunity for all sections of society. Accordingly, the goal of achieving equity in higher education is a central pillar of educational policy and I have already indicated my commitment to tackling issues of under-representation at higher levels. I am looking forward to the major forum on equity issues in higher education which the Higher Education Authority intends to host in the autumn and which will provide an oppor<Col N="1255" /> tunity to consider the issues and strategies in relation to access and equity which have been raised in the reports.</P>

      <P>The Minister correctly stated that no one measure has been recommended. Does he accept that a range of measures from pre-school to third level are urgently required if we are to make a significant impact on participation rates? Does he also accept the recommendations made in the reports and, if so, what steps is he taking to incorporate them into existing policy?</P>

      <P>The reports cover a large area, including 14 propositions of wide general applicability across the broad field of equity in higher education through which further progress towards a more equitable system may be achieved. In general terms, I support the recommendations made in the reports. A number of the specific ideas to which the reports refer were also highlighted by the Commission on the Points System. The final report of the Commission on the Points System contains a number of recommendations in relation to disadvantaged students. The principal recommendation is that the quota of disadvantaged students in third level education should be increased to 5%. The long-term aspiration is to increase participation to rates more reflective of the number of disadvantaged students in the population as a whole. I intend to establish a special group to advance matters in this area.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that in the White Paper the Department committed to creating places at third level for an additional 500 people per year from disadvantaged backgrounds? Is it also not the case that by now there should be 2,500 people from such backgrounds in third level education but that the Department has failed in this regard? Is it not true that aspiring towards a quota of 5% is meaningless unless real policies are put in place to underpin that aspiration? Will the Minister consider urgently addressing the huge shortfall in respect of existing targets?</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the targets to which the Deputy refers. Under the national development plan, the Government has made £95 million available for a third level access fund. This fund will provide opportunities to promote participation by students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students. Preparatory work on these matters is ongoing and I hope to make policy decisions on them in the near future.</P>

      <P>My officials have been engaged, with officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, in relation to options for the future administration of the various student support schemes. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund which will, <i>inter alia</i>, provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students in addition to the existing maintenance grants schemes. I am developing proposals in relation to these financial supports and I will be considering the administrative arrangements in this context.</P>
      <P>While no formal meetings have been held between officials of the two Departments over the past six months, my officials plan to have further discussions with officials from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs when proposals within my Department in relation to the third level access fund are developed. In this general context, amendments to the schemes in recent years have sought to address anomalies and promote uniformity across the schemes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that there are major implications, for example, for the local authorities and vocational education committees, in any proposals to change the administration of the schemes. It is my intention, therefore, that there will be full consultation with all interested parties and I have previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in regard to any future arrangements prior to such consultation taking place.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity of the issues involved and the need to consult all interested parties, I am of the view that it would be inappropriate to fix a rigid deadline for taking decisions on the matter.</P>

      <P>This proposal was a pet issue of the Minister's predecessor who portrayed it as being an active brief. Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether the matter has now been laid to rest or whether he sees merit in a central grant giving authority, an idea widely supported by many of the student bodies.</P>

      <P>Difficulties have arisen because of the introduction of so many innovations and new courses by this Government and by the previous Government towards the end of its terms of office, such as a further support scheme for post-leaving certificate students in the academic year 1998-9; changes in personnel in the higher education area; the need for computer staff on the Y2K project, which comprised a large part of the work of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs until January this year; and the introduction of the euro. Further meetings on this issue are planned. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs wants my Department to rationalise the new schemes and get them in order before handing over responsibility for them.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the plans he has to develop a system of local education networks to achieve better co-operation, joint programmes and partnership arrangements between schools and other service providers and community groups.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>An integral part of the Department's strategy to address educational disadvantage is the promotion of enhanced links between schools and their communities. These links and partnership arrangements operate through the employment of home-school-community liaison co-ordinators in schools in disadvantaged areas, through the role of parents and community interests on school boards of management, through the work of the vocational education committees on local drugs task forces and in the area partnerships, through the co-ordinating activities of the youth service and through the requirement for multi-agency linkages as an integral aspect of the eight to 15 year old early school and stay in school initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Area referral networks with links to employment, training, youth, welfare, health and pro<Col N="1258" /> bation services and with a wide range of community interests are part of the approach with such programmes as Youthreach and the adult literacy service. Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Bill currently before the House provides that schools will, with assistance from the National Educational Welfare Board, prepare statements of strategy, setting out how they intend to reduce the incidence of non-attendance by pupils in their schools. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) provides that these statements of strategy shall provide for &ldquo;the fostering, promoting and establishing of contacts by the school with other schools that provide primary or post-primary education and with bodies engaged in the provision of youth work programmes or services related thereto, or engaged in the organisation or sporting activities.&rdquo;  This provision will enable schools to develop and engage in a network of local bodies which have as a core focus the provision of services to children and young persons of school going age. It will help to ensure that students receive a more holistic education, not limited purely to the school but also embracing a wider section of the local community.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Education (Welfare) Bill will be passed by this House in the near future to allow for a speedy enactment. This will allow for the establishment of the welfare service on a phased basis, initially focusing on areas of disadvantage and thereafter expanding to become a nationwide service.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill, 2000, which was published recently, will provide a statutory framework for the delivery of youth work services at local level by the vocational education committees. The Bill provides for the establishment of youth work committees by vocational educational committees, which will be representative of all the interested parties and groups at local level.</P>
    <P>Each of the 38 area based partnerships established training and education sub-committees as specified in the Operational Programme for Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99. The role of these committees is to identify how partnerships can best support education and training provision at local level in conjunction with mainstream providers, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>My Department contributes to the planning work of these committees through my nominated representatives who are drawn from the Department's inspectorate and educational psychological services. In addition, each partnership has the services of an education co-ordinator, 12 full-time and 26 part-time posts, which are funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>I believe the arrangements I have outlined to the House provide for a significant amount of networking between education and sectors of the community. This is a process which I propose to continue and develop in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister's predecessor strongly resisted any devolution of power which at the time was centred in regional education <Col N="1259" /> authorities. Although he indicated that he was sympathetic to alternative county groups, he never indicated what powers such groups would have or whether those powers would be purely advisory. Does the current Minister support devolved power to local bodies which would have some power over spending on educational resources at local level? Does he support the principle of subsidiarity and does he believe that would help to create more devolved administration and establish improved co-ordination at local level?</P>

      <P>As Minister for Education and Science I am anxious that children with special educational needs receive a comprehensive response which addresses all their requirements and that the need for parents to appeal the adequacy of such provision would be kept to an absolute minimum. I also consider that my Department has a duty not only to meet the educational needs of such children, but to do so with efficiency and sensitivity.</P>
      <P>At present, any parent of a pupil with special needs may appeal to my Department where he or she is dissatisfied with the educational response made available to their child. All such appeals are dealt with on an individual basis having regard to the needs and circumstances involved.</P>
      <P>A special planning group is currently finalising work in my Department on an overall review of our approach to special education services. The remit of this group is to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of the education system for students with special needs.</P>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy in relation to appeals of provision and the most appropriate mechanism for dealing with this issue is one of the matters being addressed by the planning group.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the report of the planning group in the near future.

Everyone understood that a proper appeals system would be put in place like that established under the Education Act and which applies in relation to problems in individual schools and not merely a facility for writing a letter to the Department. He now appears to have placed that proposal with a planning group. Why is this the case?</P>
      <P>Is it not wholly unsatisfactory that 183 parents are taking court actions against his Department to try to establish adequate service for their children? Is it not unacceptable that we find the State defending such cases when we could have a simple, fair and equitable appeals mechanism, recognised by law, which would deal with these issues fairly and quickly without putting parents to that difficulty and expense?</P>

      <P>At the moment we are dealing immediately with any cases which come to my attention or to the attention of the Department. Some of the cases which have gone to court had come to my attention and had been dealt with before they were heard in court. It was not necessary for them to go to court for that purpose. I ask parents who are involved and who are concerned to bear in mind the commitment given by the Government on which I will follow through. If people then feel they wish to go to court, that is another question. Some of the packages which have been designed are ones which were later accepted by the courts.</P>

In January of this year, the Minister indicated that there would be an appeals mechanism. Is he now saying we will have an appeals mechanism on a statutory basis for such parents? The question demands a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the underlying principles of the primary school curriculum in Ireland that it should be presented where at all possible as an integrated curriculum. In effect, this means there are many links across subject barriers and that cross-curricular teaching is practised widely and is the norm rather than the exception.</P>
      <P>In relation to Irish, it is not unusual to find the language being used in the course of a school day during lessons on a wide range of other subject areas. Similarly, there is frequent reference to other subject areas during lessons in Irish. It is a basic principle of the approach to teaching Irish, as recommended in the revised curriculum, that the language acquired during the Irish lesson be used for purposes of real communication during the school day both informally and during the teaching of other subjects. In a situation where the class teacher is not a teacher of Irish, this would become impossible to implement and the position of Irish in the curriculum would be considerably diminished. It is essential, therefore, that the class teacher teach the Irish programme and that all teachers should have a level of mastery of the language which would enable them to use it as a medium both of teaching and of communication during lessons in other curricular areas.</P>
      <P>All graduates of the colleges of education in Ireland are qualified to teach the Irish language up to sixth class level of the primary school. It is an entry requirement for the colleges that candidates would have attained at least a grade C in the leaving certificate, higher level, in Irish. As undergraduates they then pursue either a B.Ed. course with Irish as a main degree subject or are required to successfully complete a course in professional Irish, Gaeilge ghairmiúil. This course is designed to develop the students' mastery of the language with particular reference to the use of Irish in the curriculum. Teachers who qualify outside this jurisdiction must obtain a pass in the scrúdú cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge, the qualifying examination in Irish, before being granted full recognition to teach in primary schools. This examination is set at a standard which matches as closely as possible the standard attained by those who graduate from the Irish colleges of education. Graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have Irish as a main degree subject in the B.Ed. degree or who have successfully pursued a recognised course in professional Irish during their years in college are granted recognition as fully qualified primary teachers in this State without having obtained a pass in the scrúdú cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute again to this debate. I commenced my contribution on the previous occasion during which brief time I outlined the detail and purpose of the Bill. It is essentially enabling legislation and is the first to deal with electronic commerce, so it will pave the way for the future. I see it as the first in a long line of legislation dealing with electronic commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I last contributed to this debate, the most topical item in the news regarding the information technology industry was what was called the &ldquo;Love Bug&rdquo;, which originated somewhere in <Col N="1264" /> the Far East and had been sent by e-mail to many computers throughout the world from Asia to Europe to America. It created severe problems and caused some stock exchanges and many financial institutions and organisations to experience severe difficulties. It is a warning for the future regarding the security required when dealing with electronic commerce. We have until now been casual. If people are to regard the computer as a way of doing business, it should be remembered that, in running a shop, office or factory, all the proper measures should be taken for the physical security of their cash, assets and premises and to ensure people cannot gain unauthorised entry to the premises.</P>
    <P>People need to take the same approach when dealing with their computer systems. It is important that proper security systems are put in place. We will see more scares along the lines of the &ldquo;Love Bug&rdquo; until we realise not just the value of e-commerce but the important measures we must take to ensure it is run in a proper and secure manner. We must bear in mind the security aspect, and that was one of key concerns expressed in a detailed survey conducted by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and published in its recent report a few weeks ago. The issue of security was the greatest single barrier to the developing of e-commerce and that has been highlighted by many members of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. I will return to the details of that survey if I have time to do so.</P>
    <P>There will be a greater difficulty regarding the issue of domain names which companies and organisations use, be they dot.ie, dot.com or whatever, and it will require legislation not just on a national but also on a worldwide basis. We will need formal legal conventions between countries regarding domain names to deal with it. There have been many highly publicised incidents of cyber squatting and it has become a fashionable business recently. An international bureau which deals with the registration of domain names voluntarily achieved agreement from some people involved to relinquish their title to domain names for a short period to give the genuine owners the right over a six week period to obtain their domain names for a modest fee and have them formally placed on the worldwide web. I hope many people will avail of that.</P>
    <P>However, that will not be sufficient. Let us take the example of the growth of the telephone network in the past three decades. In the beginning, the telephone exchange was in the local post office. We then progressed to larger exchanges and beyond that to international calls. After a while, we had to add extra digits to telephone numbers. Most of us in rural areas had our local code and a four digit number but most areas now have a seven digit phone number. When something similar is replicated through the worldwide web, there will be a continual requirement for changes in domain names and I see that as a source of problems which has not yet been properly addressed by the worldwide information <Col N="1265" /> technology community. There will be ongoing difficulties and competition in the registration of domain names, so it is an issue which will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I would like to see online government develop from this legislation and I am sure it will happen in due course. The Revenue Commissioners have the most sophisticated computers in the country. PAYE and PRSI payments can be made online on a monthly basis by companies to the Revenue Commissioners. P60s and P35s can be dealt with in the same way at the end of the tax year. I understand Revenue will be progressing this year to the point where it will be possible to log, record and pay VAT returns through the online government system.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this extended to many more Departments and agencies other than the Revenue Commissioners. The Land Registry has until now been an antiquated operation, although I know legislative proposals are before the House to which I hope we will return in the autumn. I hope when, under that legislation, it is established as a semi-State organisation and removed from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it will initiate an online procedure whereby people will be able, through their home computers, to check directly into the Land Registry office and see their folios, reference numbers and maps instead of having to go through the existing long and protracted procedures.</P>
    <P>As regards local authorities, I would like to see a situation whereby people on a housing list can check from their homes where they are on the housing list and the points they have achieved. Above all, people who have lodged planning applications will be able to check from their homes the date the information was received, when the decision is due and they will know the up to date situation. All of this will require a cultural change but we are slowly moving in that direction and we will eventually get there.</P>
    <P>The same should apply to health boards. We are all aware of the long waiting lists for procedures in hospitals, appointments with local consultants or ENT or out-patient appointments. A great amount of time and effort, phone calls, letters and correspondence are involved in getting people up to date and time is wasted in the system due to cancelled appointments. If all that could be on-line it would be far more efficient.</P>
    <P>That brings us back to this House and the Minister's Department. I would like to see e-business developed through An Post and the local post office network. There is a big issue to be dealt with through the small local post offices. One needs a volume of customers to justify the capital investment in these cases which we must recognise but I believe that if there is e-business to be transacted and they can obtain a licence for the dog, car or whatever, that is that way forward.</P>
    <P>I conclude by referring once again to the survey conducted by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland where they are fully supportive of the <Col N="1266" /> move towards e-commerce but they highlight the problem of security as a basic concern. This will have to be addressed by the worldwide community in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>This Bill is positive and will provide a useful framework for the regulatory environment in which to do business electronically in the future. However, we should not make the mistake of assuming that simply because we enact this legislation we are well on our way to becoming a global e-business hub. The Government is far too complacent in its attitude to the information society and slowly but surely the advances we have made in recent years are being eroded by lack of decisiveness and ambition in this area. On the website of the Department of Public Enterprise, there is a little promoted e-commerce forum. Of the last two registered comments one from 23 February reads:</P>
      <P>From what the Government has being doing in the last 12 months, does anyone believe that the wave of e-commerce is still as big as ever or have we failed to capitalise on the advantages that were so evident this time last year? Have we let others catch up even though it was one of the first times we were ahead?</P>
      <P>Our competitors have clearly been catching up. Last Friday week, the National Competitiveness Council published its annual report and its findings relating to telecommunications and e-business are particularly alarming. The report states in chapter seven that when compared to our competitors, Internet usage in Ireland remains low, Internet access costs are high and there is a strong need for greater competition in the telecom market.</P>
      <P>Page 21 of the report lists Ireland's most disimproved indicators on last year's report. High among them are those relating to e-business and telecommunications. On page 49 the report bluntly points out:</P>
      <P>In the absence of decisive action in these areas, Ireland risks not only the loss of an opportunity to establish a meaningful foothold in the competitive global electronic marketplace, but more seriously, we allow Ireland to become uncompetitive and therefore, unattractive, for enterprise attempting to compete on the evermore ICT-driven world market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the telecommunications companies also have a significant role to play in ensuring our increased competitiveness. In particular, I urge them to prioritise reducing the cost to business and the consumer of going online. For example, The Teligen Report in February of this year places Ireland at thirteenth of the 28 Western <Col N="1267" /> nations in terms of the cost of 30 minutes of Internet access. To incentivise people to use the Web, there is no better way than to bring costs down. However, the Minister also has a responsibility to ensure that the consumer benefits from lower prices as a result of competition. She also has a duty to provide leadership in terms of encouraging businesses to be able to do business on the web. In that regard, I suggest that this Bill could best be complemented by the following measures.</P>
    <P>These is a collection of measures I have taken from various articles and journals I have read in the past four or five weeks. The first measure that would help is a strengthening of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. Second, a clear commitment and timeframe for the full unbundling of the local loop. We have been lobbied extensively abut this recently by Esat &ndash; Deputy Yates referred to it in his contribution. Third, the continued promotion of employer led e-business training programmes. Fourth, the appointment of an e-envoy and the establishment of an e-business trust council. Fifth, a commitment that business and the consumer can carry out all necessary transactions with Government, local and national, by the end of next year and the prioritisation of investment in the regional broadband network as set out under the national development plan.</P>
    <P> The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulations operates in a complex and, at times, difficult environment. The regulator's powers are limited. These must be strengthened, for example, so that the regulator has the power to ensure that telecommunications companies publish and meet clear service level agreements. The ODTR must be able to impose effective sanctions on companies that fail to meet their commitments to their consumers. The ODTR has given a commitment to the partial unbundling of the local loop. This must go further and the Minister has the power to ensure that this happens. I call on her to set a date for the full unbundling of the local loop so that real competition in the provision of local telephony can take place. I understand that Deputy Yates will put down an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has recommended that this be done by the end of the year. Will the Minister give a commitment that this will happen in Ireland this year? The programme for Prosperity and Fairness, on page 123, calls for &ldquo;a continuing focus on awareness campaigns and e-Commerce Infrastructure initiatives to build on recent progress&rdquo;. It specifically mentions the PRISM project developed by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. This project has already trained and assisted 400 owner-managers in the development of their Internet business strategy. It has also introduced about 3,500 SMEs to doing business on the web. The success of this project according to independent evaluators is due to the fact that it is employer led with businesses and local business organisations showing other businesses the potential of e-commerce. This is one <Col N="1268" /> very effective model on which the Government could build, but it must do so quickly. Businesses in other countries are adapting to the potential of new technology much more quickly than in Ireland and we need to catch up. An example of a startling statistic is that there are seven times as many Internet hosts <i>per capita</i> in Finland as there are in Ireland. Even in Britain there are twice as many <i>per capita</i>.</P>
    <P>We need someone to champion Ireland's case to be a global e-business hub with that focus alone, someone to say we are doing well in some areas but we need to improve in others. As the Minister will be aware, there is such an office in Britain and it is working effectively. Consideration should also be given to the establishment of an e-business trust council with the function of ensuring that Ireland's small and medium sized businesses are confident in doing business online and are protected against fraud on the web. It should be a partnership between business, Government, consumer groups and drawing on the expertise of the information and communications technology specialists.</P>
    <P>I understand this case was made to the Minister by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and others when she launched its ChamberSeal trust device in February and said it was an excellent idea. No doubt she will take it on board. In terms of both the office e-envoy and the trust council, it would be an excellent idea for sections of this Bill to deal with their creation.</P>
    <P>Governments must lead by example and I call on this Government to ensure that in its interaction with business and citizens generally all activity can be carried out electronically by the end of 2001. This month the British Government stated that it believed this should be happening in Britain by 2005. I do not believe such a deadline is sufficiently ambitious for Ireland. Australia has set the deadline as the end of next year. I appeal to the Minister to set the deadline for the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>The challenge for the Government is to meet such a target and to ensure that in December 2001, every business and citizen will be able to, among other activities, file and inspect planning applications, register and tax vehicles, as Deputy Fleming said, pay taxes, file company returns, pay fees and fines and make reports of complaints to the Garda and all agencies, whether health or environmental, online. This is something which the nation must have.</P>
    <P>Next year is a census year and I see no reason that citizens cannot make their census return on-line. The speed with which governmental bodies adopt new technology sends out a strong message to businesses and citizens generally. Many of Ireland's smallest firms still seem to believe they can live without a personal computer and an Internet connection. The sooner they see the convenience, efficiency and advantages of going on-line, the more competitive they will be. All interaction with Government should be capable of being carried out electronically. The technology <Col N="1269" /> is there to achieve it and all that is needed is vision to deliver.</P>
    <P>While we can have a great legislative and regulatory environment for doing e-business, unless Internet take up in Ireland is greater and the necessary broadband infrastructure is in place, we will never become a global e-business hub. In that light, it is absolutely essential that there is a rapid roll out of the broadband network and that the investment plan in ICT infrastructure, under the national development plan, is prioritised. E-business will remove the issue of geographical location from trade but that will only happen when it is possible for every area in Ireland to link into the broadband network.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to assure us that rural Ireland will not be neglected and perhaps she could look at the Swedish Government's 6 million plan to ensure that every business and household in Sweden, no matter how remote, is connected to its national network. The e-commerce Bill is just one step on this road. If the Minister fails to move quickly, Ireland will be stuck forever in the information boreen rather than the information superhighway. It is important we move rapidly at this stage. The report from which I was going to quote shows quite clearly that we have fallen behind considerably even in the past year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is a very important step forward which will facilitate the growth and development of electronic commerce in Ireland. It contains provisions to give legal standing to electronic signatures and electronic contracts. I was glad to be one of the few Oireachtas Members to attend the first signing by electronic means of an international trade agreement signed here in Dublin by the Taoiseach and the US President. It was an event which confirmed that Ireland is at the forefront of e-commerce. This Bill reflects that reality and develops the law accordingly.</P>
      <P>Without doubt, the unprecedented upturn in the Irish economy in recent years has been fuelled by new technology and new industries. Many people have benefited but the sad reality also is that, in many respects, the advances have served to emphasise regional and social divisions. The jobs and spin-offs have grown disproportionately in the greater Dublin area and the east coast. The Border, the midlands and the west have yet to see the full benefits of these advances. Few people in the Border region, in particular, have enjoyed the miracle of e-commerce in terms of jobs and economic development. If all regions are to benefit from the technological development which this Bill recognises, then the Government must concentrate greater efforts on the advancement of the disadvantaged regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's national development plan aims to increase the potential of the BMW region to act as a counter balance to the south and east region, especially Dublin, and to pursue a more balanced growth within the region. The plan speaks also of the need to develop gateways, key centres which are the focus of development for a <Col N="1270" /> region, and points out that the notable feature of such gateways is that all but one, Galway, are in the south and east regions. Clearly, there is a crying need to develop centres such as Monaghan town and Cavan town as gateways for growth and development for the Border region.</P>
    <P>The national development plan promises £120 million to promote investment in advanced telecommunications in areas where it is clear the market will not deliver sufficient investment and to support the acceleration of the information society and e-commerce. The investment is being provided in the regional programmes with two thirds of it in the BMW regional operational programme. These commitments must not only be kept but efforts must be made increased to ensure the Border counties are allowed to benefit to the full from technological advances and attendant economic growth.</P>
    <P>Inextricably linked with the need for development in the Border region is the need for cross-Border co-operation. A recent study on North-South co-operation on e-commerce and related matters initiated by the Department of Public Enterprise has identified significant gaps in the infrastructure in the Border area. The study states that the limited level of broadband access is not in line with best practice internationally. These gaps need to be filled and the plans to update and upgrade the infrastructure must be advanced. I asked the Minister if she would be good enough to clarify the current position applying in counties Cavan and Monaghan and the plans and deadlines for upgrading the telecommunications infrastructure in those Border counties. I look forward to a positive and encouraging response.</P>
    <P>The report to which I referred, prepared by the Department of Public Enterprise, recognises in relation to the telecommunications regulatory framework, as does the e-commerce Bill prepared by this Government and similar legislation promised by the British, that there are no legislative barriers to the development of North-South e-commerce.</P>

      <P>I will proceed. We have been repeatedly told that the huge advances in technology mean that regional differences and regional disadvantages should no longer count as business will be online and commercial enterprises will be free to access national and world markets. The reality is, however, that regional imbalances persist. The national development plan recognises the disadvantage suffered by the Border region in terms of communication infrastructure. The study on North-South e-commerce which I cited recognises the great untapped potential of cross-Border co-operation and the need to create a truly all-Ireland network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the opportunity of welcoming this Bill to urge action from the Minister and the Government on these issues so that all sections of society <Col N="1271" /> and all regions can reap the benefits of the technological advances which have transformed the Irish economy. I hope my points have not been lost in the course of my delivery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing a Bill which will give Ireland a competitive advantage over its European competitors, in particular Britain, in attracting e-commerce companies to locate in Ireland. This is excellent legislation, which provides a comprehensive legal framework for e-commerce and deserves, and I hope will receive, all-party support.</P>
      <P>E-commerce represents a fundamental revolution not only in the way business is conducted but in the way in which citizens interact with the State and each other. Forester Research predicts that by 2003 17% of all world trade will be conducted electronically. E-commerce already has a fundamental effect on many industry sectors which are of major importance to the economy. Ireland is the largest exporter of software in the world and many software firms rent out their applications using application service providers or distribute their products over the Internet rather than sending out CDs. Most major PC manufacturers sell their computers direct to the customer using the Internet. Dell currently sells between $4 and $8 million dollars worth of computers a day from its servers in Bray. Soon Irish taxpayers will be able to file and pay their taxes online using Revenue Service Online, a development which will be more convenient for the taxpayer and which will in time save money for the State.</P>
      <P>E-commerce represents a huge opportunity for Ireland both to attract e-commerce companies into Ireland and to enable Irish companies to use the Internet to sell products and services to a global market, and to improve their own competitiveness by using e-commerce to cut costs. If Ireland is to seize this opportunity we need a full legal framework that gives businesses the same confidence doing business online which they currently enjoy off line. This legislation provides such a legal framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other countries in Europe are also attempting to attract e-commerce companies, most notably the UK where the Government has the stated policy objective of creating the best environment for e-commerce to flourish. The UK is a serious competitor for Ireland. It has a good telecommunications infrastructure, is English speaking and has a large domestic Internet market with more than 25% of its population online. This Bill, however, will give us a competitive advantage over the UK, as it is plainly designed to encourage e-commerce rather than to serve any other agenda. This can be seen, in particular, in the contrast between the provisions of this legislation governing the use of encryption technology and <Col N="1272" /> the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill or RIP Bill.</P>
    <P>The Irish legislation requires that the Minister or a member of the police may make an application to the District Court and if the judge considers that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence relating to an offence under the Bill will be found, the suspect may be required to decrypt it and make it available in &ldquo;intelligible form&rdquo; while failure to do so is an offence. By contrast in the UK various agencies serve notice requiring decryption without obtaining warrants through the courts for the prevention or detection of crime or if the decryption is in the economic interests of the UK. The fear is that so many Government officials will have the power to serve notices that users will have no confidence in the confidentiality of their communications.</P>
    <P>Critics have complained that the RIP Bill infringes on the European Convention on Human Rights and data protection laws by compromising the ability of an individual to ensure his own privacy and security. A leading UK information technology recently stated:</P>
    <P>As debates about the powers given to law enforcement authorities to access public keys and electronic surveillance continue in the UK there is a concern that the UK approach will reduce confidence in e-commerce and possibly slow its adoption. Unless the UK Government moves quickly, before long companies will be attracted to the more open Irish environment.</P>
    <P>Passing the legislation will be of little value if we do not let the world know about it. I urge the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Public Enterprise to undertake a joint trade mission to the US to inform e-commerce companies thinking of investing in Europe that Ireland is the place to locate and that Irish politicians understand the needs of the e-commerce industry and are able to legislate to provide companies with a supportive legal environment. The next 18 months will be crucial, as many major US companies decide their investment strategy for Europe. Time is not on our side and the Government must act with Internet speed if we are to secure this vital investment.</P>
    <P>Legislation, however, is only one building block in the structure to support e-commerce. More urgent action is needed if we are to truly seize the opportunities it offers. Other countries are investing heavily in ensuring that they are well prepared for the future challenges. The Swedish Government, for example, has used tax incentives to encourage people to purchase PCs, as a result of which one in every two Swedish households has a PC. It is committed to providing every household in Sweden with high speed Internet access at a cost of six billion euros. As a result of these initiatives Sweden is regarded as the leading country in the use of IT, and Swedish e-commerce companies, such as Boxman.com and letsbuyit.com, are moving successfully into other parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> The greatest challenge facing Ireland is not attracting foreign companies but persuading Irish companies to adopt and use e-commerce. In particular, the challenge is to persuade SMEs to adopt and move in regard to ICT developments. The infrastructure is in place. Government policy supports such companies and I encourage them to participate fully. I propose a series of concrete actions which I believe the Government should undertake as a matter of urgency to address this challenge. The Government must practise what it preaches and use e-commerce to provide services to business and citizens. The use, for example, of e-procurement by local authorities alone would create an online market worth £2 billion and would attract numerous small businesses online eager to sell their goods and services to Government.</P>
    <P>It should encourage the setting up of Irish online industry virtual markets, such as World of Fruit, and Allplastix, to serve the European market. The Government must do all in its power to encourage competition in the telecommunications market, including the immediate unbundling of the local loop, while constant access for SMEs to the Internet is absolutely essential, as is the case in Canada. SMEs need training not just in how to use e-commerce but in how to use IT in general. The Government should establish an SME education portal to deliver online training to SMEs at reasonable rates. This could be done in conjunction with a third level institution and the trade associations.</P>
    <P>Internet penetration in Ireland stands at 22% while it stands at more than 51% in Sweden. We should set a target of having the highest Internet penetration rate in Europe by the end of this year and consider using tax incentives and grants to get the majority of Irish people online. It needs to be ensured that all students leave school with a good knowledge of IT. Teachers with a good knowledge of IT are needed. I propose that every student studying in our teacher training colleges should be given a laptop for the duration of the course and IT should become an integral part of every teacher's education. A diploma course in technical support should also be established to ensure that every school employs an individual who has more advanced technical knowledge.</P>
    <P>I also believe that we, in this House, have a role to play in advancing the debate on e-commerce. The European Parliament has set up an <i>ad hoc</i> all-party committee to look at the impact of e-commerce and the Internet. We should do the same here to ensure that we are at all times on top of the issues. It could be used as a forum to meet industry experts and trade groups, such as the Irish Internet Association. Many issues, such as privacy data protection, will come before the House, which Members will need to understand and be prepared to debate. Establishing an <i>ad hoc</i> committee would be a useful first step in encouraging well informed debate and strengthening Ireland's efforts to become the European e-commerce hub.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and her officials on their recent initiative to bring Irish policy to the <Col N="1274" /> bureaucrats at the EU to impress on them Ireland's commitment to e-commerce. They made a huge impact and have been recognised as officials keenly interested in the development of e-commerce and the new economy. They gained the respect of Europe. The Minister is clearly committed to the project and enacting this Bill will be one of the first steps in positioning Ireland at the cutting edge of e-commerce development within the EU. I commend the Minister and her officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy McGuinness, for sharing his time. I compliment the Minister on introducing a Bill which seeks to regulate a most complex activity. She has formulated admirable legislation arising from extensive consultation over a period of months and taking into account international laws and protocols while ensuring that vital national interests and strategies are protected. The Minister deserves the heartiest congratulations for introducing such a forward looking Bill.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage she likened the Internet to a juggernaut. A bullet train might be a more appropriate metaphor. So many things are happening that it is important for people from rural communities to recognise the value of e-commerce and Internet changes. We see the huge value of them and from our participation in rural groups and local authorities we see the huge value and the importance of the Bill being passed by the House as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Internet has developed in many different, diverse ways over recent years. Some said it would kill the conventional postal system. The reverse has happened. It has created enormous opportunities for postal and delivery services, which is very important for rural areas. Others predicted that computers and technology would eliminate the need for us to work. The evidence suggests the opposite. Thank God there are no shortages of jobs in this country.</P>
      <P>Only two years ago we heard at public meetings throughout the regions about how difficult it was for those wishing to trade on the Internet to gain access to electronic banking facilities. Today the banks are predicting huge increases in the volume of Internet businesses. One bank has predicted that the number of customers with Internet access will increase from 10,000 to more than 100,00 within a year. There is also a huge drive to secure e-business. Sadly, this is coupled with the closure of rural bank branches, which affects local communities, especially the elderly. I welcome last week's debate on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, where the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, emphasised to the banks the importance of rethinking this policy.</P>

    <P>The Government has played a key role in promoting strategies which have ensured the development of the pharmaceutical, telecommunications, teleservices and software industries, which are integral to the unprecedented economic growth of recent years. It is also worth <Col N="1275" /> recognising the Government's commitment to education to ensure that a dynamic work force is available to these industries.</P>
    <P>We are now world leaders in software sales and, thankfully, the Government has been implementing policies which we can stand over and which will ensure that we are at the forefront of the information age revolution. This Bill will help to ensure that we maintain this position. Many speakers have referred to this.</P>
    <P>The Internet is the fastest growing network in history. In the 1920s there were just 75,000 telephones connected in the world. The current annual connection rate for telephones is 75 million and this is growing. Hundreds of millions of new users are connecting to the Internet on an annual basis. Not long ago most Deputies would have been absorbed in helping their constituents get a telephone connected. Today those same constituents can avail of up to four services, offering telephones, cable television and Internet access. These are now set to expand substantially over the coming years.</P>
    <P>It is also worth recognising that we are enjoying the benefits of a booming economy, but we need to maintain our position as leaders and promoters of the e-commerce revolution. E-commerce allows a small, peripheral country like Ireland to lead this revolution. The Bill allows the industry to develop and flourish without undue interference from the Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minster's statement that the Bill is not just for the business community. This is very important, especially for rural Deputies. There is an inherent recognition that it will take time to bring everybody into the net and to facilitate those who have not had access to computer training. While it is not the Minister's direct responsibility, I urge her and the Minister for Education and Science to continue efforts to ensure that school children have access to computers. While great strides have been made in recent years, more needs to be done to ensure that all schools have a sufficient number of computers to allow pupils gain access to information technology. This should be coupled with the provision of access for those of the adult population who have not had any information technology training. Perhaps FÁS, in conjunction with the vocational education committees, could have an expanded role here.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that teleworking is becoming a feature of working life in Ireland. Only this week, the Stock Exchange, which for many years was a place where stock brokers did business in a civilised manner around a circle, went electronic. The building is to close forever. Many rural Deputies would welcome a similar change in the Dáil. It would mean we could work from home and would not have to make regular journeys to Dublin. That is for the future.</P>
    <P>As a rural person I recognise the benefits to rural life from what is happening. Developments in e-commerce can, and are, bringing tangible benefits to rural communities. They are allowing <Col N="1276" /> people to work in new and less stressful ways, such as reducing the need to commute to work. They are also ensuring that lights are kept on in homes day and night, keeping people in their communities and keeping communities alive.</P>
    <P>Legislation that endeavours to make it easier for individuals and companies to trade electronically will ensure that rural Ireland will stay alive and prosper. The information age is one of the few developments in the past few centuries that may stem the rush to the cities and promote locally based development. Distance and location are not barriers in the world of e-commerce.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister engaged in extensive consultation on the Bill. This is evident from its content and from the response to it &ndash; the Bill has been universally welcomed. The Minister was charitable in her remarks about the British Minster for e-commerce, Patricia Hewett, when she said a similar Bill in Britain had become overlain with bureaucracy. I understand there is deep unease within the UK business community with the British legislation. Many businesses have already moved their e-commerce operations to other countries, thankfully including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is different. It has been welcomed by the business community at large. It is an enabling and facilitating Bill. It does not seek to add extra burdens on businesses wishing to engage in e-commerce, rather it seeks to facilitate them in their work. The Bill is good for business and consumers. It is another example of the no-nonsense approach we have come to expect from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly recognised that it is futile to attempt to over regulate for something that is constantly evolving. The rate of change in information technology is far too great to do so effectively. While we as legislators must plan for the future, we should not allow legislation to stand in the way of progress. The Minister has wisely taken the approach that technology innovations will arise and may need amending legislation. Instead of peering endlessly into a crystal ball, she has taken the pragmatic approach of dealing with the problems technology may present. For example, only three years ago President Clinton signed electronically with the Taoiseach an important electronic protocol. We have seen since then important developments in the area of encoding and secure transactions.</P>
    <P>We will not assist consumers or businesses if we do not respond rapidly to the changes brought about by technology. We need to be able to adapt to such developments quickly and efficiently to ensure that e-commerce can thrive without unnecessary legal impediments. There are consumer checks and balances in the Bill, but it must be remembered that legislation cannot replace the need for the buyer to be wary at all times. E-commerce needs the buyer to be especially vigilant.</P>
    <P>There are many other important provisions in the Bill, such as allowing for parallel paper and electronic systems to operate, especially within Departments. Many people, young and old, still <Col N="1277" /> wish to conduct their business with pen and paper. Now is not the time to make e-commerce mandatory. I am sure many Deputies would not replace letters by e-mails, etc.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister. We have attended many meetings on the value of maintaining rural life. This is the first time there is a positive response to that need. The fact that rural groups, through the Leader Programme, enterprise boards and local authorities, recognise the importance of e-commerce and that they have an equally important role to play in it as those living in cities, allows for the first time an opportunity to recognise the potential of their input. We should do everything we can to facilitate that. Only last week, when canvassing in the by-election in south County Tipperary, we encountered some people who are involved in rural post offices. They recognised the Minister's commitment to ensuring that as many rural post offices as possible are updated with modern technology. I congratulate her on this and encourage her to take further measures in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy McGuinness on his excellent speech. I urge the Minister and her officials to take note of the points he made and see them implemented. He put a great deal of research into it. I welcome this important legislation and I compliment the Minister on introducing it so swiftly. However, the Bill will be worthless unless some of the fundamental problems in the telecommunications sector are tackled. One of these problems relates to ISDN lines or high speed access to the Internet. ISDN involves a high speed, dual channel, digital line which makes downloading information from the Internet much quicker and improves access to e-mail. It saves time and money. It will be fundamentally important to small and medium sized enterprises if they are to participate in e-commerce.</P>
      <P>The Eircom Internet site promotes the use of ISDN high speed lines. It mentions how much quicker it makes downloading information and browsing. However, if one is in the unfortunate position of wanting an ISDN line installed, the service is not high speed. It is more akin to a snail's pace. Many of the complaints I have received in relation to ISDN lines, and I have experience of it myself, relate to the slowness involved in the installation of lines. It can take up to three months in some cases. There are also ongoing difficulties after the system is installed and delays in terms of Eircom resolving problems. In some cases, delays can be as long as six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue is cost because Eircom continues to charge for the old line and the old handsets even if one has upgraded the handsets. Unless one rings Eircom and informs it that the line has been removed and the handsets changed, it will continue to charge for them. The public should be conscious of that and the procedures within Eircom. It is a pity that many of the old semi-State practices have not changed since it became <Col N="1278" /> a public company. If e-commerce is to develop, it is crucial that this mentality in Eircom is broken and the only way that will happen is through competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I received an e-mail from the chamber of commerce in Wicklow. Some of its members applied for ISDN lines at the end of last year but they were told there would be a minimum of a three month wait because Eircom had to invest in additional equipment to increase capacity. We are talking about promoting e-commerce but businesses are being told that they must wait three months before Eircom can even consider installing an ISDN line. This is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>ISDN is approximately four times faster than using modems on existing PSTN lines. The new technology, which is ADSL, is approximately 20 to 40 times faster than using a modem on an existing line. Eircom said recently that this technology should be up and running within two years. However, some other companies have stated that they can have the system in operation within six months. This will not be the case throughout the country, but it would be a positive step.</P>
      <P>If one wants to upgrade a line to ISDN, one gets two 64 kilobyte channels, one for voice and the other for the Internet, over the existing line. However, the problem is that Eircom has a stranglehold on existing lines because the local loop has not been unbundled. If competition is to be introduced in the sector and e-commerce is to be promoted, it is fundamentally important that the local loop is opened up. This would break Eircom's stranglehold on this area and ISDN lines at present. It is providing a poor service to small and medium sized enterprises. This is why many such enterprises are afraid of the Internet and of taking the e-commerce route. If a business must wait four or five months without Internet access, it will not be encouraged and it will not solve any problems for Eircom. The unbundling of the local loop must take place to ensure competition, to provide a new range of services, to reduce costs and to encourage e-commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to it. I note the Minister of State represents the relevant Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science.</P>
      <P>It is again necessary to discuss the issue of student nurses. This matter has been raised on several occasions over the past year. There have been a number of protests about the unfairness of the fact that student nurses were the only full-time undergraduates who had to pay fees in the State. The fees are currently approximately £2,000. On several occasions, Members on both sides of the House raised this matter through parliamentary questions or on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The validity of the case was finally recognised recently when the Minister for Health and Children, probably because of his experience as Minister for Education and Science, acknowledged the plight of nurses in training and announced a package of £15 million to effectively pay the fees of student nurses during their degree course year. This £15 million will cover the next few years, starting from January. This move is welcome and it recognises the unfair anomaly that existed to which many Members drew attention. However, I have raised the issue again to draw attention to the 237 current students and recently qualified nurses who are being left out of the initiative. They have been overlooked and I appeal to the Minister of State to introduce measures to facilitate and provide financial support for existing students and recently qualified personnel who will not benefit from the latest initiative.</P>
      <P>Student nurses unlike any other students are much needed by society and the economy. We are in a position where our health services cannot expand because of the shortage of nurses. There is a nursing home in my constituency in which only 50% of the beds are open. The others cannot open because no nurses are available. This story is replicated throughout the country. There is a dire shortage of nurses and we cannot afford to alienate any nurses in the system. This is why I appeal to the Minister of State to recognise the unfairness of the treatment of the current student nurses and those who recently qualified.</P>
      <P>There are 120 nurses in training at present, pursuing the degree course. They are due to qualify in the coming months. We cannot afford to alienate those student nurses or their comrades who qualified recently. This is why there is a strong case for providing some form of financial assistance either through a rebate of fees or a waiver of any remaining fees which are due to be paid this year. We badly need those nurses to stay in the country and to fill the many vacant posts in our health service which are preventing it from developing and people from receiving vital health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> I ask the Minister of State, on the grounds of justice and equity, to make a special arrangement for this small group of people who are needed in our society and whom we cannot afford to alienate. They have made a commitment in terms of their training over a four year period. It is grossly unfair to single them out and to alienate them when the principle has been recognised by the Minister for Health and Children in his £15 million package. A small sum of money, £474,000, is required to give a rebate to those who have already incurred significant expenditure. I appeal strongly to the Minister of State to introduce an initiative as the Minister has already done for future student nurses. We should not forget the student nurses in training and those recently qualified. I look forward to a positive response from the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this issue. As the Deputy outlined, a large number of registered nurses and midwives pursue part-time degree courses. There are variations between health agencies in the provision of fee support. The priority action plan agreed between the Department of Health and Children and the nursing unions for the implementation of core recommendations of the Commission on Nursing includes a commitment to the introduction of uniform criteria for the provision of financial support to nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration education courses. This has provided the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, with a unique opportunity to create a level playing field for the payment of nursing fees.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently announced that from 1 January 2001 nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment by nurses to continue to work in our public health service for a period of up to two years after the completion of the degree course. This fees initiative will continue until at least the year 2005 at an estimated additional annual cost of £3 million.</P>
      <P>This initiative is designed for the benefit of nurses who do not already have a degree and includes fees for access courses and nursing degrees undertaken through distance education. It will apply to nurses employed in our public health service in either a permanent or temporary capacity. An important objective of the initiative is to provide an assurance to graduates from the three year nursing diploma programmes that they will have an opportunity to undertake a part-time degree course and have their fees paid. This should act as an incentive to newly qualified nurses to enter the workforce following registration and to remain there, thus alleviating the current shortage of nursing personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this initiative will apply from next year, nurses who commence part-time degree courses <Col N="1281" /> before then are outside its scope. However, it is open to such nurses to apply to their employers for financial support towards their fees. The main health agencies have continuing nurse education budgets out of which they may provide financial assistance to nurses undertaking post-registration education programmes.</P>
    <P>There is a one academic year nursing degree course currently on offer at the National University of Ireland, Galway. This course was developed by NUI, Galway, against the wishes of both the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Health and Children, both of whom favoured the development of part-time nursing degree courses in line with the approach adopted by other third level institutions. In the context of the present shortage of nurses, it is vitally important that newly qualified nurses who have successfully completed the three year nursing diploma programme enter the workforce as soon as they are registered. If students were to delay their entry by a further year to undertake the type of degree course offered by NUI, Galway, this would exacerbate the difficulties some hospitals are experiencing in recruiting nurses.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the fees initiative announced by the Minister is to encourage graduates from the nursing diploma programmes to enter the nursing workforce immediately and for employers to retain them. This initiative has been warmly received by Deputy Shortall and the nursing unions who regard it as the most equitable approach to the provision of financial support to nurses and midwives wishing to undertake post-registration education programmes, irrespective of their model of pre-registration training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le hoifig an Chinn Chomhairle, leis An Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus leis an Aire Stáit as ucht cead a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a ardú. Ba bhreá liom í a phlé as Gaeilge toisc go bhfuil an t-Aire Stáit anseo agus tá Gaeilge líofa aici, ach b'fhéidir gur cheart dom ar son an phobail i gcoitinne í a phlé as Béarla an uair seo.</P>
      <P>The issue I wish to raise relates to the need for the Government to develop a policy on the anaerobic digestion of organic animal and human material which finds its way into landfill sites and causes considerable problems. It does not have the same benefits as in other countries where anaerobic digestion is in place. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will be aware of the many signs around the country protesting against the construction of dumps. They generally read, &ldquo;No Stench, No Seagulls, No Rats, No Leachate&rdquo;. This organic material, whether sewage sludge or food or livestock related, goes to landfill sites. That must be changed.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State and to the Government to look again at anaerobic digestion. I could list a number of countries which have developed what we know as anaerobic digestion. D520&ndash;D10</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> Anaerobic digestion produces conditions which encourage the natural breakdown of organic matter by bacteria in the absence of air. It provides an effective method of turning residues from livestock, farming, food processing or sewage sludge into biogas, which is rich in methane and can be used to generate heat and/or electricity, fibre which can be used as a nutrient rich soil conditioner, and a liquor which can be used as liquid fertiliser.</P>
    <P>In Denmark there are 19 centralised biogas plants and 18 on-farm biogas plants currently operating and further new plants are under construction or planned. The development of biogas plants based on animal manure has been predominantly undertaken in centralised plants. Today these plants function well both technically and economically. At the centralised plants the animal manure is transported from farms to biogas plants and the residues are returned after digestion for use as a fertiliser. The manure may be co-digested with different waste products from the food industry. The total biomass input to the plants, including waste, ranges from 10,000 to 160,000 tonnes per year.</P>
    <P>Landfill sites are being used throughout the country to dispose of animal and human material. Given the pressure to increase stocking levels, particularly in poultry and pig farming, farmers are faced with the dilemma of what to do with considerable amounts of organic matter. The only option they feel they have is to spread it on the land. However, the land can only take so much as it is not a sponge. It will eventually overflow and cause eutrophication. Many group water schemes are paying the price as a result of the presence of e.coli and other contaminants.</P>
    <P>It was the last straw when 700 to 800 tonnes of sludge, which was discovered in the Ringsend area, was taken to a landfill site in Rogerstown Estuary. This will leach into the water courses and the sea. This is a primitive and unacceptable way to deal with what is a benefit if treated properly but an enormous problem if treated badly.</P>
    <P>The benefits of anaerobic digestion are manifold. They include energy balance, reducing greenhouse gases, displacing the use of finite fossil fuels, recycling nutrients, reducing land and water pollution, reducing demand for peat, supporting organic agriculture, reducing odour and efficient electricity distribution. There are many economic benefits such as improving waste farm management, reducing spread of weeds and disease, contributing to nutrient regimes, financial incentives, biogas and energy, local economic development, meeting new regulatory pressures and reducing pathogens. Those benefits are not being harnessed. Instead we are causing problems. I ask the Minister to address this so that we do not waste resources and cause problems.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is unable to be here. He, no doubt, would have answered the Deputy in Irish. He has asked me to respond on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The appropriate management of organic wastes is an important element of waste management nationally. Organic wastes form the largest fraction of total waste quantities arising annually. They include 40 million tonnes of animal manure and slurries requiring management. They also include 166,000 tonnes of sludges from industrial sources and 38,000 tonnes of sludges from urban waste water treatment plants.</P>
      <P>Currently almost all agricultural waste is spread on agricultural land. Landspreading is likely to continue as the dominant management route for the majority of such wastes. It is considered to be the most appropriate management option when carried out with due care and in suitable soil conditions to meet the nutrient requirements of the soil and crops. Guidelines for this purpose have been issued jointly by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Alternative options may need to be developed for certain areas where there is a shortage of suitable spreadlands or where soil nutrient levels are already high. Anaerobic digestion is one system which might provide an alternative management option in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sludge is an inevitable and potentially very useful by-product of advanced waste water treatment processes. Consultants were appointed in 1997 to carry out a series of studies on the sustainable reuse of waste water sludges. On the basis of these studies, it has been decided that in order to protect Ireland's green image and our important agricultural and food processing industries, we will aim at full treatment of sludge, including pasteurisation, and its conversion into a valuable soil conditioner and fertiliser. This product is known as biosolids. The extensive guidelines which resulted have now been given to local authorities to help them address all the key issues which they will have to consider when preparing sludge management plans. Local authorities have been made aware of the need to take rapid action in this area and are now actively engaged in preparing their <Col N="1284" /> plans. I am confident that this valuable recycled resource can be used in a manner entirely consistent with our commitment to have very high levels of protection for human health and the environment.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are required under the Waste Management Act, 1996, in the context of developing comprehensive waste management plans, to have regard to the agricultural waste and sewage sludges and the rationalisation, development and improvement of the existing waste collection, recovery and disposal infrastructure and the provision of new waste management facilities.</P>
    <P>The potential for use of anaerobic digestion is being considered by local authorities in this context. In the north-east region, for example, the county councils of Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan have adopted a regional approach to the planning exercise and have examined options for the treatment of excess slurries. Agricultural activity in the region, notably in Counties Cavan and Monaghan, has been characterised by a high concentration of intensive activities such as poultry rearing, pig rearing and mushroom production which produce significant quantities of spend compost and animal manure. The draft waste management plan for the region concludes that agricultural wastes should be managed in the context of nutrient management plans to ensure that sludges are placed on lands with a nutrient deficit. With the limited availability of suitable lands in the region alternative options, including thermal and biological treatment, are being considered. In particular, the feasibility of a central anaerobic digestion plant in the region is being examined.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has commissioned a more general study to evaluate the feasibility of applying centralised anaerobic digestion for the treatment of organic wastes and waste waters in sensitive catchments. This study was commissioned in the context of national policy objectives such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the development of renewable energy sources and the diversion of biodegradable organic waste from landfill. The results of this study will serve as a valuable input to the development of waste management plans by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I hope these comments have reassured the Deputy that the option of anaerobic digestion is being adequately addressed i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in 1998 to undertake a survey of radon gas levels in all primary and second level schools. This survey is being undertaken in three phases and involves the measurement of the radon gas concentration over a full school year in every occupied ground floor room in the school. Schools in ten counties were surveyed over the 1998-99 school year. Schools in Mayo are being surveyed over the current school year, 1999-00.</P>
      <P>The measurement period for this current phase has just concluded. I understand that many of the second level schools involved in this current phase of the survey have begun to return the detectors to the RPII for processing. The RPII has written to primary schools seeking the return of the detectors. The RPII expect to be in a position to issue the results to each school, including those in Mayo, later this year.</P>
      <P>My Department has appointed a consultant to devise mitigation programmes where necessary. To date, a number of schools have had mitigation programmes implemented and a further series of programmes are pending. The full cost of the entire mitigation programme will be borne by my Department. Furthermore, schools have been given advice on the interim measures that may be taken to reduce the build up of radon. Additional information will be disseminated to all schools with radon levels in excess of the reference level shortly.</P>

      <P>Applications from teachers trained outside the European Union for recognition as fully qualified primary teachers are assessed on an individual basis. Such teachers must have a primary teaching qualification from a jurisdiction outside the European Union to teach the range of primary school curricular areas to children aged four to 12 years. Applicants are required to submit their qualifications to the Department for assessment. At the moment, teachers from outside of the European Union are not eligible for the five-year period of provisional recognition that applies to teachers from the European Union and, accordingly, cannot take up positions in mainstream primary schools until they meet the Department's Irish language requirements. In order to meet this requirement teachers must have obtained a pass in the scrúdú cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG, and provide certification that they have attended an approved three week residential course in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>However, non-EU teachers whose qualifications have been assessed as satisfactory, but who are not entitled to teach in mainstream primary schools because they do not possess the Irish language qualification, are recognised by my Department to teach in special schools and classes where Irish is not a curricular requirement. This recognition has also been recently extended to allow such teachers to take up positions as resource teachers for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the person referred to by the Deputy is that her qualifications have been submitted to, and assessed by, my Department. She has been granted restricted recognition to teach in certain special schools and classes. She is also now entitled to take up resource teaching posts for children with special needs. On taking up a post in a special school or class, or a resource teaching post, she will be remunerated at the full rate of salary and be entitled to all additional qualification allowances.</P>
      <P>I have asked officials within my Department to examine the possibility of extending the same treatment to non-EU teachers as is currently applied to teachers trained within the EU. Teachers trained within the EU, on having their qualifications assessed as satisfactory by my Department, are given a period of provisional recognition of five years in order to allow them to obtain the Irish language qualification. During this period of provisional recognition these teachers are entitled to take up teaching positions in any primary school and are remunerated at the normal salary levels, including the payment of additional qualification allowances. I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the result of the examination referred to above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is finalising a comprehensive circular on the recognition of teacher qualifi<Col N="1287" /> cations at primary level and it is intended that it will be issued to all schools early in the next school year.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, establishes education as a key priority of Government. The plan provides for a third level access fund totalling £95 million. Building on the existing arrangements, the development of third level access is necessary to promote the participation of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students.</P>
      <P>The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries while improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications. It will meet the specific needs of students with disabilities in terms of equipment and support services; provide financial support to disadvantaged students by way of additional support to the existing maintenance grants scheme; develop outreach initiatives currently undertaken by a number of third-level institutions which involve links with second level schools and community groups and are designed to both assist students to meet the points requirements for the standard CAO entry procedures and to provide complementary special entry arrangements; and expand the provision of particular services, such as counselling and mentoring services, to meet the needs of non-traditional students.</P>
      <P>Considerations are ongoing on the allocation of funding for initiatives under this fund. I am not yet in a position to convey details about the allocation of the funding. However, I can confirm that any additional direct financial supports to students will be made available in the course of the 2000-01 academic year.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that our educational system continues to produce skilled people to meet the demands of the job market. In recent years, a range of initiat<Col N="1288" /> ives has been put in place to support this commitment. The expert group on future skills needs, part of the business, education and training partnership, was set up to address skills needs at national level. In response to the first report of the group, the Government approved an additional investment of some £81 million for the provision of an additional 5,400 third level places and for the continuation of the post-graduate conversion programmes in IT related areas. The accelerated technician programmes in the institutes of technology sector were expanded to include information technology.</P>
      <P>The second report of the expert skills group was published in March 2000 and the recommendations in the report are currently being considered and will be pursued through the management implementation group.</P>
      <P>The need for increased apprentice capacity is also being addressed through the allocation of significant additional funding to cater for the increased capacity resulting in an anticipated doubling of capacity between 1997-98 and the next academic year. These developments are being accompanied by continued expansion in the number of students participating in the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied; a ninefold increase in investment in adult literacy, with provision increasing from £0.850 million in 1997 to £7.825 million this year; plans for a major expansion of part-time further education options under the Back to Education Initiative. £1.027 billion has been provided for this in the national development plan; and implementation of an applied languages and information technology &ndash; international teleservices &ndash; programme within the post-leaving certificate sector in collaboration with industry.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Education and Science I am committed to ensuring the delivery of an effective educational support service for all children with special educational needs, including children with specific learning difficulties. I would also be most anxious that the system should operate in a manner which is fully responsive to parents and teachers who are coping with the needs of children. All fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> Where the condition is of a more serious nature, children with specific learning difficulties may attend their local school where they can be supported by the special resource teacher service. In this connection, I would point out that arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special educational needs within the primary system, including children with specific learning difficulties, now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. Indeed, since this decision was taken the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from 104 to 450 and is continuing to grow as needs are identified. Special in-service training is provided by my Department's in-career development unit for teachers catering for children with special needs, including children with specific learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>Where the parents of children with special needs, including specific learning difficulties, are concerned, I would be anxious that the system should be as responsive and supportive as possible. In this connection, I would point out that a special planning group is currently finalising work in my Department on an overall review of our approach to special education services. The remit of this group is to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all levels of the education system for students with special needs.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the Deputy in relation to support for parents and teachers of special needs children, including children with specific learning difficulties, are among the matters being addressed by the planning group. I expect to receive the report of the planning group in the near future and I can assure the Deputy that I will respond as positively as possible to any proposals which will contribute to supporting parents and teachers of children with special needs, including children with specific learning difficulties. The Deputy will be aware that I have also recently announced the establishment of a special task force to review the adequacy of current support services for children with specific learning disabilities &ndash; dyslexia &ndash; and to make such recommendations as are considered appropriate for the development of services in this area. My objective is to ensure the most effective and efficient education services for the children in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the survey to which the Deputy refers. The management authorities of schools may apply to my Department for capital funding towards improved or additional accommodation to cater for children with special educational needs, including remedial education. The appropriate response to the accommodation needs of a school will vary depending on the specific circumstances and the number of children involved. Accommodation for special needs pupils may take the form of a permanent extension to an existing school or, where the need is more immediate, prefabricated units may be provided.</P>
      <P>In all cases, a process involving determination of long-term need, architectural planning, the procurement of planning permission and a fire certificate, a tender competition and the engagement of contractors will be necessary. My Department makes every effort to process such matters as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>Funding for special needs accommodation is provided from within the allocation for primary school buildings, which in the current year amounts to £81 million. This level of funding represents a very substantial increase on that available in previous years and I am satisfied that it is sufficient to meet current requirements, including accommodation requirements arising in the special needs area.</P>
      <P>The remedial and resource teaching services have undergone very significant expansion in recent times. In September 1999 the remedial teacher service was extended to every primary school in the country. This development involved the allocation of an additional 164 remedial teacher posts and brought the number of remedial teachers in the primary sector to 1,465.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, arising from a Government decision in <Col N="1291" /> October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system now have an entitlement to an automatic response to their needs, irrespective of their disability or location. As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has grown from 104 in October 1998 to 450 at present.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to allocate further resource teacher posts in response to identified needs and any accommodation requirements arising from this development will be given full consideration.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that significant progress has been made regarding the implementation of relationships and sexuality education in schools.</P>
      <P>As I indicated recently in reply to a similar question, April 1999 is the latest date for which figures are available regarding levels of implementation of relationship and sexuality education &ndash; RSE &ndash; in primary and post-primary schools. Based on a 66% response rate from primary schools and 64% from post-primary schools the data, collected in late 1998, indicated that 24% of respondent primary schools were already implementing an RSE programme and 57% indicated an intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the 1998/1999 school year. A total of 67% of respondent post-primary schools are already implementing RSE in some or all classes and 78% indicated their intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the school year. The results of a follow-up survey are currently being finalised and I expect the results to be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RSE training support service, which is funded by the in-career development unit of my Department, acts as a support to schools in this work. It continues to organise information seminars for parents and for boards of management of schools, policy development seminars for <Col N="1293" /> school-based committees, whole school staff seminars and the production of resource materials for teachers. In this respect, senior cycle resource materials issued to schools in September 1999 and the final set of materials for fifth and sixth classes at primary level have also been issued. I expect that all of these activities are having a positive influence on the levels of implementation of RSE in schools.</P>
    <P>As regards the timeframe within which all schools will be implementing an RSE programme, it is not possible to be definitive in this matter. I recognise that schools are at different stages of implementation and that for many the policy formulation process, which involves school management, parents and teachers working collaboratively, is a relatively new experience. Feedback from schools has indicated that this process has been extremely valuable for all concerned and I am confident that the range of supports being made available to schools will speed up the process of implementation.</P>
    <P>We need to continue our efforts to ensure that all children have access at the earliest possible stage to an RSE programme which enables them learn about their own development and about their friendships and relationships with others.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the regulation of the employment of young people falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, allows a young person of 15 years or older to work up to eight hours per week during the school year subject to the stipulation that such employment finishes no later than 8 p.m. During holiday time 14 and 15 year olds can work up to 35 hours per week providing their employment finishes no later than 8 p.m. This legislation is monitored by the inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>In a buoyant economy the temptation for young people to concentrate on employment to the detriment of their studies inevitably increases and parents, schools and my Department all have a role to play in countering this. Clearly the influence of parents is paramount in providing the best and most supportive environment for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also very important that we support schools in ensuring that their pupils remain within the system to completion of senior cycle. In this context, I refer the Deputy to my recent announcement regarding the expansion of the <Col N="1294" /> stay-in-school initiative. This major initiative has, as its focus, those students who are at risk of dropping out of school, including those for whom part-time or temporary employment is a very real attraction. Following this recent expansion, this initiative will embrace 116 schools nationwide and I am confident that, over time, it will make a real impact on this problem.</P>

      <P>In the further education sector, a range of programmes is provided, principally by vocational education committees, which include adult literacy and community education programmes, youthreach and senior traveller training centres catering for early school leavers, the vocational training opportunity scheme, and post leaving certificate courses. There are 92 Youthreach and traveller centres, a further 45 centres in FÁS, almost 100 VTOS centres, 205 PLC centres and an expanding range of adult literacy programmes.</P>
      <P>The formulation of outreach strategies to attract people who would stand to benefit from adult education programmes, particularly in the area of literacy and basic education, is encouraged in the Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning. The funding provided by my Department for adult education is increasing significantly in the context of the national development plan and this will provide for further locations to be developed in the period ahead as the need arises. A major expansion of part-time options will be implemented under a back to education initiative, aimed principally at adults with less than upper secondary education.</P>
      <P>As part of this measure, an adult ICT basic skills programme will be implemented. While it is intended that the expansion will make optimum use of existing school facilities outside school time, the development of additional centres will be considered where the need arises and full use will be made of new technology to support open learning and distance education. These issues will be further progressed in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on adult education, to be published shortly.</P>

Interim reports on each of the two dimensions of Breaking the Cycle have now been received in my Department and are under consideration.</P>
      <P>I propose to wait until nearer to the end of the pilot project in June 2001 and receipt of the final evaluation report before making any further plans in relation to this initiative.</P>
      <P>Under the new £194 million three year programme to address educational disadvantage, which I am currently finalising, significant financial and personnel resources will be allocated to the schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils for the implementation of in-school and out-of-school supports for the pupils and their families.</P>

      <P>All juvenile offenders placed in the custodial facilities operated under my Department undergo detailed assessment of all aspects of their needs including their educational needs. Most of these assessments are carried out in the National Remand and Assessment Centre, Finglas in the case of boys or in Oberstown girls centre in the case of girls. The assessments cover areas such as education, social skills, offending behaviour, relationships, family dynamics, medical history, psychological evaluation, substance abuse and job skills.</P>
      <P>The therapeutic programmes followed in the centres are individually tailored to meet the specific needs of each young person and any special needs are addressed as part of these programmes. All programmes follow &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; intervention methods generally accepted throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>The progress of all young persons is evaluated at case reviews and case conferences throughout the year. All members of the multidisciplinary team, including outside agencies, evaluate the progress of such programmes and plan for their revision. Specific intervention strategies may require the monitoring expertise of psychologists and/or psychiatrists. These services are available when necessary at the centres.</P>
      <P>Good child care practice demands that proper planning is undertaken when children enter residential care. This detailed planning addresses the question of how care is to support the young person while in the residential facility and to prepare them for their re-entry in to the community and family.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is providing additional teaching resources at both primary and second level to assist schools with significant numbers of pupils with English language deficits.</P>
      <P>Primary schools with between four and 14 such pupils receive grant aid to enable them to provide additional teaching hours to meet the English language needs of their pupils. These grants amount to £5,000 in the case of schools with four to nine such pupils, and £7,500 where ten to 14 pupils are enrolled. A small start up grant is also payable to such schools.</P>
      <P>At second level, my Department has allocated approximately 12 whole-time equivalent teaching posts in the current school year specifically to cater for the needs of children who do not speak English as their first language. Individual post-primary schools or vocational education committees may apply for additional teaching hours in respect of non-national students who may have particular English language deficits. Furthermore, where extra accommodation is shown to be necessary as a result of the enrolment of non-national pupils, my Department will bear the cost of providing such accommodation.</P>
      <P>I point out that all non-national pupils who are validly enrolled are included in the overall school enrolment for the purposes of capitation, free books and other grant schemes operated by my Department.</P>

      <P>It is clear from both my Department's annual statistical report and analyses undertaken for the national council for curriculum and assessment, that variation in grade allocation between subjects in State examinations exists. However, while the variation can be clearly identified, no definitive research as to its causes has been undertaken, although it would appear that many complex, varied and inter-related factors may be involved. It is, likewise, difficult to gauge the extent to which this variation may be a factor in students' subject choices.</P>
      <P>The variation in grade allocation was also considered by the Commission on the Points System. Analyses undertaken by the commission suggested &ldquo;that there was an expectation [among students] that it would be easier to gain a high grade in certain subjects&rdquo;. The commission recommended that research be undertaken to identify the cause, or causes, of the variation in existing patterns of grade allocation across leaving certificate subjects. The recommendations of the commission are currently under active consideration in my Department, and planning for an implementation strategy is under way.</P>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute is currently undertaking a study of the factors influencing students' choices of science subjects in senior cycle of second level schools. The second phase of this study will be completed in the autumn of this year. My Department looks forward to considering the findings of this study.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from next September is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. The flexibility given to schools under this initiative will be supported by the putting in place of guidelines, which will strike the right balance between allowing a reasonable level of discretion and achieving the implementation of national policy priorities. In addition, the schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year <Col N="1299" /> with a further increase of £8 planned for this year. Schools have welcomed these improvements.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for second level schools and I will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. I assure the Deputy that the recommendations of the report on the funding of second level schools will inform such funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools, &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo;, was developed by my Department in consultation with the partners in education and other relevant interests. The development took place in a small number of primary schools during the school years 1996 / 97 and 1997 / 98 and the programme received a positive independent evaluation.</P>
      <P>The dissemination of the programme's detailed educational resource materials to primary schools commenced in January 1999, with a two year completion target. The programme has now been introduced to approximately 2150 primary schools, 67%. The process is currently being reviewed and, if necessary, it is my intention that provision be made to continue the dissemination in 2001 until all primary schools have had the opportunity to introduce the programme. The funds provided for the dissemination amounted to £500,000 per annum for 1999 and 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, the substance misuse prevention programme, &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; has been introduced in approximately 570 post-primary schools, 75%. Some £70,000 was spent on this programme in 1999. The Department of Health and Children also provided significant additional funding. The dissemination of this programme commenced in early 1995 and has continued each year since. Following on a report from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, it is planned that social, personal and health education, SPHE, including substance misuse prevention education, will be phased in to all schools at junior cycle over a three year period, beginning in September 2000. <Col N="1300" /> In this context a support service for SPHE, including substance misuse prevention, will be in place in Autumn 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, first of all, to correct the impression which might be created by this question that there is a general feeling among survivors of child abuse that they should boycott the commission to inquire into child abuse. That is not the case. As far as I am aware all but one of the several groups set up, both here and in Britain, to support survivors of abuse have welcomed the establishment of the commission and are actively advocating people to attend. It is important that that message be clearly conveyed from this House so that the confidence of already vulnerable people may not be damaged.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the decision by one of the groups concerned not to participate in the work of the commission. This group has in the past met with officials of my Department but has not done so in recent times, although officials have made themselves available to meet them and are still available. It is through such meetings, where there can be detailed discussion of outstanding concerns, that doubts can be clarified and compromises reached where possible. Since the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, has now been enacted establishing the commission on an independent statutory footing, I and my Department have a limited role to play in the conduct of its affairs and it is essential that this is clearly seen to be the case in the interests of ensuring that its independence is in no way compromised.</P>

      <P>I am aware that managerial authorities of primary schools in certain areas are experiencing difficulties in obtaining the services of fully qualified teachers. However, a range of measures has been introduced to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education was increased substantially in the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 sessions. The projected intake in the 1999/2000 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996/97.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification, are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C honours in the leaving certificate are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
      <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate, pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. Such teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</P>
      <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any difficulties in relation to the recruitment or retention of teachers in second level schools. If the Deputy has any particular areas or schools in mind, I will have the matter <Col N="1302" /> examined if he supplies me with the relevant details.</P>

      <P>The evidence available on pupils' reading progress and standards arises from two sources. One study was conducted in 1990-91 by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement &ndash; IEA &ndash; in which both Irish nine year olds and 14 year olds participated. At both age levels, Irish pupils scored just <Col N="1304" /> above the international average. Further analysis of the data from this study by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, indicated that between 6.5% to 8.5% of Irish 14 year olds had serious literacy difficulties.</P>
      <P>There is an estimate from the 1993 national English reading survey, which was conducted by the Educational Research Centre in conjunction with the inspectorate of my Department, that between 6.5% to 9.5% of Irish 11 year old pupils have serious literacy difficulties. Pupils reading achievements are highly correlated with their ability. In the absence of information on the ability of each individual pupil, there is no evidence to suggest that almost a third of pupils are falling behind in reading.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated 1,465 remedial teachers at primary level and 560 whole time equivalents at second level to support the lowest performing 10% of pupils. Six courses are organised every year to train approximately 150 remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>Revised guidelines on learning support/ remedial education will be published this year. The revised primary curriculum has been sent to all schools during this year. A significant programme of in-career development of teachers in regard to the introduction of the English curriculum has taken place. There is an increased emphasis in the English curriculum on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills as part of a whole language process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need for an integrated approach to the delivery of educational provision at local level. To this end, many educational initiatives, such as the eight to 15 early school leavers initiative, involve co-operation among schools and between schools, other agencies and the local community. Allied to these initiatives, the development of the national educational psychological service and the proposed educational welfare service will help to ensure an integrated, local approach to the delivery of services, particularly to the disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to keep these and other education initiatives under review with a view to optimising their effectiveness. As part of the review process ways and means of development and strengthening co-operative endeavours will be examined and explored. However, I have no plans to intro<Col N="1305" /> duce bureaucratic local administrative structures which would stifle rather than foster growth and development in local communities.</P>

      <P>The level of investment in upgrading teacher skills has increased substantially since 1994 when the in-career development unit of my Department was established with a remit to develop, resource, manage and monitor a programme of inservice training for teachers. The level of funding for this programme has grown steadily in the intervening years from £4 million in 1994 to over £17.6 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>This considerable investment enables a wide range of training and support for teachers to be provided. This is done through the development of the national education centre network, the provision of national programmes associated with curricular change and innovation, including major programmes such as the support programmes for the revised primary curriculum and the IT 2000 initiative, and the provision of courses designed to meet the ongoing professional development needs of teachers.</P>
      <P>The extent of the investment in this area is kept under constant review and my intention is that funding will continue to be made available to provide a satisfactory level of in-career development support for the teaching profession.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that an additional 1000 teaching posts will be created at second level in the 2000-01 school year. A proportion of these posts is being provided to facilitate the reduction from 19:1 to 18:1 in the pupil teacher ratio for <Col N="1306" /> appointment purposes which I recently announced.</P>
    <P>The actual pupil teacher ratio at second level has been reduced significantly in recent years. The creation of the additional posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in a further reduction in the actual pupil teacher ratio in the sector.</P>
    <P>The pupil teacher ratio at primary level has also reduced significantly in recent years. In the current school year the pupil teacher ratio is 20.4:1. The retention of the posts arising from the demographic dividend for the current year will further reduce the PTR.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I am allocating an additional 200 teaching posts at primary level for the 2000-2001 school year to specifically deal with disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that new measures were introduced recently to ensure that there is appropriate educational provision in place for non-English speaking pupils at primary school level.</P>
      <P>Primary schools which have 15 or more non-national pupils with significant English language deficits will be automatically entitled to an additional temporary teacher for a period of up to two years. Schools with 35 or more such pupils will be entitled to two temporary teachers. Where two schools operate on one campus and have 15 or more such pupils they will be entitled to an additional temporary teacher on a shared basis. Schools eligible for additional teacher or teachers will also receive a once-off grant of £200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary schools in which between four and 14, inclusive, non-English speaking non-national pupils are enrolled will receive grant assistance. Schools with between four and nine such pupils will receive grant assistance in the amount of £5,000 while schools with between ten and 14 will receive grant assistance in the amount of £7,500. This grant aid is intended to enable schools to take appropriate measures to improve the standard of English of non-national pupils with significant English language deficits. Schools with three or fewer such pupils are expected to pro<Col N="1307" /> vide for the educational provisions of those pupils from their existing resources.</P>
    <P>At second level, my Department has allocated approximately 12 whole-time equivalent teaching posts in the current school year specifically to cater for the needs of children who do not speak English as their first language. Individual post-primary schools or vocational education committees may apply for additional teaching hours in respect of non-national students who may have particular English language deficits.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the arrangements in relation to the allocation of teachers to cater for the education of refugees and asylum seekers will be subject to review. In addition, the refugee language support unit, established under the auspices of Trinity College, will be provided with a budget of the order of £1.2 million over the period of the programme to co-ordinate action for language tuition for refugees to assist them along the pathway to independent living. The unit's functions are fulfilled in co-operation with the Refugee Agency, FÁS and refugee groups themselves. In addition, refugees are among the groups catered for as part of the adult literacy programme provided by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>All non-national pupils who are validly enrolled are included in the total enrolment of a school for the purpose of capitation grants, free books and other grants on the same basis as Irish pupils.</P>
    <P>A greater attitude of tolerance can be fostered in schools in the context of civic, social and political education. This is a core subject in the junior cycle for recognised post-primary schools. Civic, social and political education aims to prepare students for active participatory citizenship. It is based on a number of central concepts. These include democracy, rights and responsibilities, human dignity, law and stewardship. The study of civic, social and political education helps pupils to understand and respect human rights. One of the key aims is the development of skills to allow pupils to participate fully in the democratic process. It aims to help students to recognise this participation as a basic human right of all, irrespective of colour, class or creed.</P>
    <P>The study of CSPE facilitates the co-operation between the school and outside agencies who have expertise in the community. During the European Year Against Racism in 1998 much useful resource material was developed by organisations such as the National Youth Council of Ireland. The curriculum development unit of the City of Dublin VEC has developed modules on human rights education in partnership with the CSPE support service and Trócaire and is currently running a pilot project on education for reconciliation. At the heart of these materials, and others being developed by a number of non-governmental organisations for use in schools, is the understanding and appreciation of difference <Col N="1308" /> and the fostering of an attitude of tolerance to all difference.</P>
    <P>The issues of tolerance and anti-racism are also addressed in the new primary school curriculum through the social, personal and health education programme. One of the aims of this programme is to help pupils recognise and acknowledge the various cultural, religious or ethnic groups that exist in society and to instil in them a respect for and an appreciation of human and cultural diversity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>A discussion paper was prepared by my Department in relation to assessment issues at junior certificate as a further contribution to the consultation process begun with the circulation of the Junior Cycle Review Progress Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &ndash; NCCA.</P>
      <P>The discussion paper notes that, in the case of the leaving certificate, assessment leads to certification for selection and that the integrity of such a system must be beyond question. Consequently in such a high stakes environment the concerns of teachers, including members of the ASTI, in relation to participation in school-based assessment are understandable. The paper argues that in the case of the junior certificate there should be scope for change because its value no longer lies predominately in providing certification for selection.</P>
      <P>A public consultative process was conducted by NCCA and I am currently considering the outcome of that process in terms of future developments in assessment at second level.</P>
      <P>In relation to continuous assessment, such a system could of course be developed for use in the certificate examinations but it must be realised that there are serious practical constraints in releasing teachers from school if such assessment were to be conducted externally. Continuous assessment is in reality only a viable option if it is school based.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 1996, my Department published a manual Safety in School Science: A Code of Practice and issued it to all schools. It contains general guidelines for best practice in school science, including a section on laboratory organisation and management which deals with matters such as storage, stock control and waste disposal.</P>
      <P>At the same time, my Department published a manual that it commissioned from Forbairt entitled Safety in the School Laboratory: Disposal of Chemicals. This manual gives clear guidelines on the disposal of individual chemicals that are commonly found in school science laboratories. The manual explains how most of these chemicals may be safely disposed of in schools in accordance with the instructions given. My Department also contracted Forbairt to operate a help-line to further assist schools at that time.</P>
      <P>To assess the range and volume of chemicals, a questionnaire was issued to all second level schools in October 1996. They were asked to identify and report on the amount of certain chemicals which are no longer required for school purposes and which could not be disposed of by the school in accordance with the guidelines given. The completed returns were collated and analysed by the curriculum development unit &ndash; CDU &ndash; of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. A report by CDU of this analysis was issued to all schools in February 1998.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the results of the survey, my Department in conjunction with CDU and the Health and Safety Authority arranged for a training programme to provide further assistance and advice for all second level schools on disposal and storage issues. The programme was conducted in April and June 1998 for science teachers from all second level schools. It was intended that this training programme would enable schools to review further their chemical stocks, to arrange for the safe storage of chemicals which will be required for future use and to arrange for the disposal of unwanted chemicals which can be disposed of safely by schools in accordance with the guidelines already given.</P>
      <P>Although it remains the direct responsibility of school authorities to manage their stocks of chemicals and ensure the safety of students, staff and property, my Department has recognised that a co-ordinated strategy is required to deal with the problem of unwanted chemicals that cannot be disposed of within schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1999 my Department carried out a pilot <Col N="1310" /> exercise with 19 community and comprehensive schools in the Dublin area to engage disposal contractors to identify and remove unwanted chemicals. Based on the results of the pilot study my Department is putting in place a comprehensive strategy to deal with the chemicals in question in the remaining schools.</P>
    <P>As part of this strategy my Department will advertise shortly for companies interested in tendering for the contract to remove the unwanted chemicals from the remaining schools. In addition, my Department has written recently to all post-primary schools asking them to confirm that they wish the Department to make arrangements for the disposal of their unwanted chemicals and to forward updated details of relevant unwanted chemicals to the curriculum development unit &ndash; CDU &ndash; of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee which will administer the scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies are already aware, I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this process, the Educational Research Centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools. Work on analysis of the responses from schools is nearing completion and the results will allow for the identification of levels of disadvantage in every responding school.</P>
      <P>I intend allocating additional resources next September to selected primary schools that have the highest concentrations of young people at risk of educational disadvantage. Differing levels of interventions will include extra teacher support and-or extra funding which will be allocated to selected schools and will reflect the levels of need identified. Also, within this new approach, schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage will retain the supports they already have and may be eligible for additional help.</P>

      <P>The recently published ESRI-Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment 1998 annual school leavers' survey indicated that about 81% of students currently complete second level education. This figure is broadly in line with my Department's analysis of data in this area which indicates a completion rate of some 83% when account is taken of a range of factors such as inter school transfer and emigration.</P>
      <P>Given the vital significance of school completion for the life chances of our young people we must continue to press for improvement in the numbers completing second level. As the Deputy will be aware this is a complex and difficult issue and one not amenable to quick fix or easy solutions.</P>
      <P>The correct approach in dealing with this issue is to advance on a number of fronts. In the first instance, we must ensure that there is a proper legislative underpinning to school attendance. I see the Education (Welfare) Bill as providing this. We must also ensure that the curriculum provided in our second level schools meets the needs of all pupils. The leaving certificate applied and the junior certificate schools programme are examples of measures which have made a real impact and we need to build further on these.</P>
      <P>It is also essential that we assist schools in a very direct and focused manner in coping with the problem of early school leaving. The recent Stay in School initiative will make a real difference here. At the core of this initiative is the concept of schools devising their own plans and being assisted to implement these. This assistance is very much a reality both in terms of advice and, most importantly, additional resources.</P>
      <P>I do not want to understate the scale and complexity of this problem by setting absolute timescales for reaching particular levels of retention. In a buoyant economy the temptations for young people to leave school early inevitably increase and the challenge for Government is to offset this by considered and effective action.</P>

      <P>The Education Act, 1998 allows for different parts of the Act to be commenced at different times. Any sections not commenced by 23 December next will automatically come into effect on that date. My Department's priority is <Col N="1312" /> to facilitate a planned and structured implementation of all the provisions of the Act. Two commencement orders have been made to date covering 51 of the Act's 59 sections.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Act was commenced on 23 December 1999 and work is currently under way in my Department on drawing up the grievance and other procedures referred to. At primary level, consultations have been initiated with the education partners and it is hoped that existing procedures will be updated before the commencement of next school year. A similar consultation process will also be necessary in relation to second-level.</P>
      <P>Section 29 allows for certain decisions made by a school to be appealed to the Secretary General of my Department. Planning work has commenced on the structures and procedures necessary to implement this section. The necessary commencement order will then be made.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on a survey of parents of children with special needs which revealed that 44% of parents indicate that almost none of the special supports identified in the assessment of their child have been made available.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Education and Science I would be seriously concerned that any parent of a special needs child should feel that the needs of their child are not being adequately addressed.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, this Government has undertaken an unprecedented level of development of special education services.</P>
      <P>Arising from a Government decision in October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their disability or location. The response in question may take the form of resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the particular needs involved. Already, as a result of this development, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has grown from 104 in October 1998 to 450 at present. The number of special needs assistants helping children with special needs in the primary system has increased from 299 to 1,095 over the same period. My Department will continue to allocate further resources in response to identified needs.</P>
      <P>In addition, the special pupil teacher ratios applicable to all special schools and special classes catering for children with special needs have been reduced to the level recommended by the Special Education Review Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, since September 1999 the remedial teacher services has been extended to every first and second level school with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. Schools with lower ratios are free <Col N="1313" /> to apply to my Department for remedial support where they can demonstrate a need for the service.</P>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency was formally established with effect from September 1999. This service is being developed on a phased basis over five years with the objective of ensuring that all schools will have access to the service by the end of 2004. As part of this process, the number of psychologists in the service will be increased from 43 to nearly 100 by the end of the year 2000.</P>
    <P>While these developments constitute a major advance in the quality of our special education service, I fully recognise that much work remains to be done. In particular, where the parents of children with special needs are concerned, I would be anxious that the system be made more responsive and supportive. In this connection, I would point out that a planning group is currently finalising work in my Department on an overall review of our approach to special education services. The remit of this group is to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all levels of the education system for students with special needs.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the report from the planning group in the near future and I assure the Deputy that I will respond as positively as possible to any proposals which will contribute to supporting children with special needs and their parents.</P>

      <P>Teachers in primary schools are appointed and employed by the managerial authority of the school. In the event that the managerial authority of a primary school is unable to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher, at a particular time, they may appoint a person who is not fully trained in a temporary capacity. The managerial authority must continue to make every effort to obtain the services of a fully qualified person, including re-advertising a post.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a temporary shortage of trained teachers at present, but I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of measures have been introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The intake of trainee primary teachers to the Colleges of Education was increased substantially in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers shall graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C honours in the leaving certificate are paid at the trained rate, when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>Primary degree holders who hold the diploma in education, but do not have grade C in the honours leaving certificate, but commence employment after 1 April 2000, are paid at the trained rate for up to 14 weeks.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish Language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the level of information available to him regarding absentee rates in second-level school; the research, if any, which he has commissioned into the underlying causes of this; and if he will outline his proposals for tackling this increasing problem.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Second level schools are not required to notify my Department when pupils absent themselves from school and for this reason the information available to me on absentee rates is largely anecdotal. However, I am aware that schools and other agencies dealing with young people are reporting their concerns in this area. At present, school attendance by young people up to the age of 15 years is compulsory under the School Attendance Act, 1926. The enforcing authorities for this Act in Cork, parts of Dublin, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire are the respective corporations or councils. Outside these areas, the Garda Síochána is the enforcing authority. At present, there is no national authority to monitor or co-ordinate school attendance data at a national level.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill 1999, currently before the House, addresses this deficiency. This Bill provides for a comprehensive range of measures to deal with the problem of school non-attendance. Among the key objectives is the establishment of a single national authority with responsibility to co-ordinate action in relation to school attendance on a countrywide basis. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. Schools will have the responsibility to maintain accurate and up to date records of the attendance of their pupils, which will be available for the education welfare officer to inspect during the year. At the end of each school year the managerial authority of a school will prepare a report for the education welfare officer on the levels of attendance at that school during the year. The national board will co-ordinate these figures at a national level.</P>
      <P>The Bill also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system. This should help identify young people who may be at risk of early school leaving thus allowing preventative measures to be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> However, legislative solutions are not in themselves enough and it is vitally important that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. The Government's Stay in School retention initiative is designed to provide resources to schools where the problem of drop out is most acute. At the core of this new strategy is the empowerment of schools to participate in framing plans for addressing this problem. Fifty-seven schools experiencing retention problems accepted invitations to participate in this initiative late last year. All of these schools are now implementing and developing their school plans. These plans are tailored by the schools to counter their own local problems and consist of a wide range of measures to encourage and support those of their pupils who are at risk of early school leaving. I recently announced the expansion of this initiative and 59 additional schools have now been invited to participate bringing the total number of schools involved to 116.</P>
    <P>This issue is not a simple one and in order to have a real chance of success the solution must be wide-ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment. I have outlined the major steps being taken to address the issue and I am confident that these steps will provide the basis for developing and refining strategies to counter school non-attendance in the future.</P>

      <P>A planning group, representative of all the partners in education, was established in 1997 to examine the level of need for an educational psychological service and to make recommendations for the future. The planning group produced its report in September 1998 and recommended that my Department should establish a National Educational Psychological Service Agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; with an overall target number of 200 psychologists, to be achieved over a five year development period. The Government decided, in early 1999, to accept the recommendations of the planning group and the NEPS agency was formally established on 1 September 1999.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are currently over 60 psychologists already working in the education sector. Up to 50 additional psychologists will be appointed to NEPS during the year 2000. I have already approved the appointment of 25 of these psychologists, whose names have been recommended to me by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. This means that almost 100 educational psychologists will be in post by the end of the year. It is envisaged that there will be a fully operating psychological service to all schools by the end of 2004.</P>

      <P>The report and recommendations of the expert advisory group on certificate examinations on the arrangements for the assessment of candidates with special needs in certificate examinations was published recently. This followed lengthy consultation and consideration by the group of this complex and difficult area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group recognised that there are cases where many of the elements of a subject that are marked in the examination are accessible to a student but some, because of a particular difficulty the student has, are not. An example is the aural component of a language subject that may not be accessible to a student with a hearing impairment. The group pointed out that it is reasonable that the student sit for examination in the components of the subject in which achievement was possible and that he-she be exempted from the specific and identifiable component. What this means is that the national standard for assessment should be modified to accommodate <Col N="1318" /> the student and this modification is enabled by including an explanatory note with the results.</P>
    <P>These measures make the examination system more flexible and responsive to the needs of students who would otherwise have difficulty with some examination subjects because of their special needs. This represents a significant advance in the inclusiveness of the examination system.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy and all interested parties that in implementing these measures my Department will, of course, confine any explanatory note to the assessment issue in the subject or subjects concerned. There will be no reference to the special needs of the candidate. The note will explain only how the standard national assessment was modified.</P>

      <P>A school plan or the process of school development planning is by its nature ongoing. Many schools at primary and second level have been engaged in school development for some time and are at various stages in the developmental process. There has been a strong tradition of school development planning in the primary sector for over 20 years and experience of school evaluations indicates that the vast majority of schools have documented various aspects of curriculum and school policies as part of a school plan. About 84% of secondary schools and community and comprehensive schools surveyed recently &ndash; response rate 65% &ndash; were engaged in the school planning process or had a school plan. A survey of VEC schools is being planned at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools are being assisted in the school development planning process in a number of ways as part of a £5 million expenditure over the years 1999-2002: comprehensive school development planning guidelines were published for primary schools in the summer of 1999 to provide a uniform template for drawing up a school plan; my Department published School Development Planning &ndash; An Introduction for Second Level Schools in September 1999; detailed school development planning guidelines will be issued to second level schools by September 2001 following a development project being undertaken by 130 schools at present; the process is being further assisted by national co-ordination teams at both primary and second level; additional full-time and part-time facilitators have been trained and will be available to assist schools;a total of 717 <Col N="1319" /> schools mainly serving areas of disadvantage are being grant aided at present to assist them in the process; and it is intended to extend grant aid to all first and second level schools on a phased basis during the period 1999-2002.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that between now and the end of 2002 all schools will have embarked on or consolidated their school development planning process. It is also hoped that most schools would have made significant progress, with very many having a school plan in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>I am currently implementing a £194 million three-year multi-sectoral programme to offset educational disadvantage that will provide specific supports for early education, primary, post-primary and third levels of the formal system as well as life-long and continuing education. The supports will target people at risk of, or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. The supports will also be provided to those with poor levels of literacy skills as well as people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The current disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level is inflexible and does not take account of different levels of need. For this reason, although the scheme encompasses 16% of all primary school pupils, it is not necessarily an effective mechanism for assisting those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new programme involves a comprehensive survey of all primary schools to assess the level of concentration in each school of pupils who have background characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The Educational Research Centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to <Col N="1320" /> all primary schools. Work on the analysis of the responses from schools is nearing completion and the results will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every school.</P>
    <P>I intend allocating additional resources next September to selected primary schools that have the highest concentrations of young people at risk of educational disadvantage. Differing levels of interventions will include extra teacher support and/or extra funding which will be allocated to selected schools and will reflect the levels of need identified. Also, within this new approach, schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage will retain the supports they already have and may be eligible for additional help.</P>
    <P>Over £25 million will be made available to this new scheme at primary level in the next three years.</P>
    <P>I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that an additional 225 posts were allocated to second level schools for the current school year. Arising from the creation of these posts, all schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education and all designated disadvantaged schools have been invited to participate in the home/school/ community liaison scheme this year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that an additional 1,000 teaching posts will be created at second level in the 2000-01 school year. Up to 150 of the additional posts are being allocated to facilitate the expansion of participation in the leaving certificate applied and junior certificate school programme. These programmes have proved most successful since their introduction providing, as they do, broader curriculum choice for pupils.</P>
    <P>The new measures provide for an increase in the teacher allocation to schools participating in the programmes. In the case of the leaving certificate applied, the additional teacher allocation in respect of the first group of pupils will be increased from 0.25 of a post to 0.5 of a post and each additional group will qualify for 0.25 of a post as heretofore.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the junior certificate school programme will be made available in an additional 100 second level schools over the next few years and this will be encouraged by an improved teacher allocation for this programme.</P>
    <P>The actual pupil teacher ratio at second level has been reduced significantly in recent years. A proportion of the new posts is being provided to facilitate the reduction from 19:1 to 18:1 in the pupil teacher ratio for appointment purposes at second level. The creation of the additional posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in a further reduction in the actual pupil teacher ratio in the sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994. The programme is funded by the Department of Health and Children and is fully operational since 1998. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. While undertaking the diploma programme, the students' fees are paid by the relevant health agency and they receive an annual non means-tested maintenance grant and other supports.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children consulted a number of colleges in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes, which would be open both to nurses graduating under the revised programme and to nurses who graduated under the traditional model of education and training. These programmes were intended to offer post-registration qualifications on a part-time basis. The Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Health and Children has decided that from 1 January 2001, nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses to continue to work in our public health service for a period of up to two years after the completion of the degree course. This fees initiative will continue until at least the year 2005.</P>
      <P>The National University of Ireland, Galway introduced a one-year full-time nursing degree programme for students who have completed the three year nursing diploma programme. As the Deputies will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Health and Children has stated that his Department is not in a position to meet the fees of students undertaking this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This degree course has not been included within the scope of my Department's free fees initiative. As this matter is at issue in the case <Col N="1322" /> of Sarena Tansey and Others <i>v</i>. the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Health and Children, the Western Health Board, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>An amount of £5 million was provided in the 1999 budget to provide grants to schools that set up and run after school child care services. My Department is currently formulating details of a scheme for an after school support service, in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which has also been allocated £5 million to support community based groups to develop after school child care services in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that my Department's scheme will be confined to schools in disadvantaged areas. In the case of the primary sector, schools will be selected on the basis of criteria being developed by the Educational Research Centre for the new, more targeted child centred programme being introduced following a survey of all primary schools. Selection at second level would generally be based on retention levels and may be linked to the current stay-in-school retention initiative. The grant to each school would cover the cost of a co-ordinator and other personnel and would include other operating costs such as insurance, heating and lighting. It is envisaged that this scheme will be operational in the schools selected by September next.</P>
      <P>My Department has also provided £2.3 million this year for child care to support access of participants to Youthreach, Traveller training centre programmes for early school leavers and the vocational training opportunities scheme for the unemployed. The funds are allocated to the vocational education committees for direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on existing commercial or community crèches and for the payment of childminders subject to compliance with tax and registration requirements under the Child Care Acts.</P>
      <P>These schemes will further enhance the package of initiatives introduced in December 1999 to combat educational disadvantage.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 87 together.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties which arise from a reduction in the level of class contact as a result of a range of issues including in-service and the absence of teachers on examination work. There is no doubt that this is a complex issue and one not amenable to easy solutions. For that reason I established a working party comprising officials of my Department and representatives of the education partners with a view to examining the present model of examination of oral and practical work. The working party is considering a number of approaches to the difficulties that arise where examinations are conducted on an external assessment model and I look forward to receiving their report in due course.</P>

      <P>In March of 1999, my Department formally requested the Office of Public Works to undertake a pilot survey of 196 schools in the south-east of the country to determine the location, type, form and condition of any asbestos material present and the steps necessary to manage the problem. The intention of my Department in conducting the sample survey was to obtain information on the likely scale and extent of the presence of asbestos in school buildings nationwide. The initial survey was completed in July 1999 by a firm of specialist consultants commissioned by the Office of Public Works. It identified an asbestos presence in some form or another in 59 of the 196 schools surveyed, i.e. about 30%.</P>
      <P>Although, generally speaking, the condition of the material was found to be good and posed no immediate health risk, its removal, where possible, was recommended and a programme of works was commenced immediately, with funding made available from my Department. Remediation work has now been completed in the 59 schools identified in the survey.</P>
      <P>The initial survey has since been extended to all schools nationwide, primary and post-primary, and the management authorities and principals of every school were informed of this in December 1999. Following on this phase of the survey, a programme of works involving remediation is currently under way in 156 schools and contracts have been awarded or are being processed in all cases. Total expenditure in 2000 on the programme is likely to be in the region of £4 million.</P>
      <P>Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements to undertake the work in accordance with the relevant health and safety legislation are made by my Department and the Office of Public Work. The entire cost of the programme of detection and removal is being borne by my Department. The necessary level of funding will continue to be allocated to the programme as a priority.</P>

      <P>The need for additional capacity in institutes of technology to cater for the unprecedented increase in apprenticeship numbers is being addressed by my Department in conjunction with the institutes of technology. In the two financial years 1998 and 1999 a total of £6 million in recurrent funding was provided to fund additional apprentice places. A further £5 million <Col N="1326" /> is being provided this year. In addition, my Department has allocated specific capital funding to the institutes of technology to meet the demand for apprenticeship places as they arise during 2000. These funds amount to over £7 million and are allocated to various institutes across the country.</P>
      <P>As a result of the measures taken to date, the number of apprentice catered for in the educational system has increased from just over 4000 in 1997-1998 to 7,200 in the current academic year. The substantial increase in apprentice numbers over a very short period has led to problems in fully addressing demand. However, I am taking steps to increase capacity further with the result that I expect training will be provided for an additional 1,300 apprentices in the next academic year. In addition, my Department is liaising with the institutes of technology to provide training for a minimum of 700 apprentices during the summer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the regulation of the employment of young people falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, allows a young person of 15 years or older to work up to eight hours per week during the school year subject to the stipulation that such employment finishes no later than 8 pm. During holiday time 14 and 15 year olds can work up to 35 hours per week providing their employment finishes no later than 8 pm This legislation is monitored by the inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>In a buoyant economy the temptation for young people to concentrate on employment to the detriment of their studies inevitably increases and parents, schools and my Department all have a role to play in countering this. Clearly, the influence of parents is paramount in providing the best and most supportive environment for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also very important that we support schools in ensuring that their pupils remain in education to completion of senior cycle. In this context I would like to refer the Deputy to my recent announcement regarding the expansion of the stay in school initiative. This major initiative has, as its focus, those students who are at risk of dropping out of school, including those for whom part-time or temporary employment is a very real attraction. Following this recent expansion this <Col N="1327" /> initiative will embrace 116 schools nationwide and I am confident that, over time, it will make a real impact on this problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on early childhood education &ndash; Ready to Learn &ndash; sets out a blueprint for the development of the sector, with the aim of building on existing provision and assisting providers to raise quality of provision. Support will con<Col N="1328" /> tinue to be made available for the initiatives outlined above. In addition, the State may become involved in further direct provision in certain instances, where the educational needs of the White Paper priority groups &ndash; disadvantaged children or children with special needs &ndash; are not being met by existing State-funded services.</P>
    <P>More generally, the White Paper also sets out a range of proposals designed to assist providers. These include the development of a quality in education mark to be awarded to providers who meet defined standards concerning matters such as curriculum and staff training. Supports will also be developed in a number of other areas including the production of materials and developmentally appropriate guidelines; research, development and dissemination of best practice; the provision of an advice, evaluation and inspection service; the development of a framework for qualifications and the provision of incentives for schools to make suitable premises available for pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper, is currently under way in my Department. A consultation process between my officials and parties with an interest in early childhood education is nearing completion. Detailed implementation of the White Paper proposals will be undertaken following the completion of the consultation and planning process.</P>

      <P>A range of measures have been introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education was increased substantially in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers shall graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject, as part of their teaching qualification, are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C honours in the leaving certificate are paid at the trained rate, when employed in a temporary capacity. Primary degree holders who hold the diploma in education, but do not have grade C in the honours leaving certificate, but commence employment after 1 April 2000, are paid at the trained rate for up to 14 weeks.</P>
      <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</P>
      <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes, without <Col N="1330" /> the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification, is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <Quest>if he will address the concerns expressed by parents and boards of management that the clause in the new Education and (Welfare) Bill, 1999, requiring principals to pass on names of all children absent from school for 15 days or more is overly restrictive particularly as principals would almost always know if pupils had good reason to be absent such as sickness or holiday.</Quest>

      <P>My concern to protect the educational welfare of children provides the basis for the measures referred to by the Deputy. In situations where children are frequently missing school, for whatever reason, it is clear that there may be a danger to their educational welfare. The Education (Welfare) Bill, therefore, contains a mechanism to ensure that principals will report the fact that a child has missed the prescribed number of school days to the local educational welfare officer. The educational welfare officer will then assess the reasons why the child has missed school, and consider whether the educational welfare of the child may be at risk. In situations where there is no danger, for example, where a child is absent due to a once-off illness, no further action may be necessary. However, in other situations, this mechanism will act as an early warning indicator, to allow both the school and the National Educational Welfare Board to intervene to assist and support the child to protect that child's right to education.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific number of days chosen, 15, I have listened carefully to the views put forward, both on the recent Committee Stage debate on the Bill and, indeed, more generally from concerned groups. I do not wish to create a situation where principals are obliged to report on children's absence from school in situations which pose no threat to their education. I am, therefore, considering amending this area of the Bill on Report Stage to provide for an increased number of school days that may be missed by a child before a principal is obliged to notify this fact to the local educational welfare officer. The Bill will continue to include a further provision which will allow principals to notify the educational welfare officer of the situation of any child where the principal has concerns as to that child's educational welfare, regardless of the number of days missed. This will create a more balanced and flexible approach to identifying children whose education is at risk. I will bring forward specific proposals in this regard at Report Stage.</P>

      <P>A range of supports has been put in place over the past two decades to support primary and second level schools designated as disadvantaged by my Department. The supports include the payment of enhanced capitation grants. In the case of many of the designated schools, ex-quota concessionary staffing is allocated and inclusion in the home-school-community liaison scheme has been offered to all designated schools. In addition, a number of pilot projects were introduced in selected primary schools including the early start pre-school project, Breaking the Cycle and the &ldquo;Support Teacher&rdquo; project. At second level, curricular reform, the introduction of the junior certificate school programme, the transition year programme and the leaving certificate applied have increased the range of options that are more responsive to some young people's needs.</P>
      <P>More recently, the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative was introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Its purpose is to develop and test models of the delivery of supports for those young people who are most at risk of educational disadvantage or are outside the formal school system while still of compulsory school-going age. I have decided to provide the resources for a new phase of this initiative for the period from 1 July next until 31 August 2002 and to retain the support of the projects' co-ordinator for that period. In addition, at second level, £28.4 million will be allocated to selected schools through the &ldquo;Stay in School&rdquo; retention initiative, which currently involves 57 schools serving pupils and areas with higher than average levels of early school leaving. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. I have decided that a further 59 schools will be included in this initiative with effect from September 2000 and that a third co-ordinator will be appointed to support its development.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, at primary level, resources in excess of £25 million will be allocated to schools over a three-year period to tackle educational disadvantage. A survey of all primary schools by the Educational Research Centre is now nearing completion. The survey is designed to identify the schools with the highest levels of concentration of pupils with &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; characteristics. I hope to make a further announcement on this initiative in the near future.</P>

      <P>The result dates for the certificate examinations derive from the timing of the examinations and the time required for marking the scripts and processing the results. While my Department makes every effort to issue results as early as possible, it must be recognised that there are real constraints on making any significant improvement in respect of the junior certificate if the issue date of the leaving certificate is not to be affected. Given that there is a finite pool of suitably qualified examiners, my Department ensures that the number of examiners engaged in the leaving certificate marking process is adequate to enable the result deadlines to be met. This is possible because the later issue of junior certificate results provides, where necessary, additional time to examiners undertaking the marking of the junior certificate.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the difficulties being encountered by students and following consultation with third level colleges, the Government introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of tax incentives in the past resulted in the provision of a significant number of student residences. As the tax relief will be available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant <Col N="1334" /> additional accommodation for third level students. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government will evaluate the impact of these tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation.</P>
    <P>These tax incentives are intended to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and represent a targeted response to the underlying issue of an accommodation shortage, rather than an across the board increase in grant levels which, at a considerable cost, would have no direct impact on helping students to compete in the rented accommodation sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the value of third level maintenance grants, I previously indicated my intention to follow the practice of recent years and increase the grants in line with inflation, so as to ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. In addition, there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan to promote the participation of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second chance students. This fund will, <i>inter alia,</i> provide financial support to disadvantaged students by way of additional support to the existing maintenance grants schemes. Considerations are ongoing on the allocation for initiatives under this fund. I am not yet in a position to convey details about the allocation of the funding.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy to be referring to a recent newspaper article showing the percentage of students receiving grants or scholarships in 1997-98 based on, as yet, unpublished and provisional Higher Education Authority material. The finalised student statistics relating to the academic years 1996-97 and 1997-98 are expected to be published later this year.</P>
      <P>Our higher education institutions have statutory obligations to promote equality both in terms of gender equality and in terms of equality of opportunity for all sections of society. Accordingly, the goal of achieving equity in higher education is a central pillar of educational policy and I have already indicated my commitment to tackling issues of under-representation at higher education. There have been a number of important developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> The national development plan provides for a third level access fund of £95 million 2000-2006 to promote participation of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness indicates that additional financial supports for disadvantaged students, including disadvantaged mature students, will be put in place, targeted at those most in need.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the points commission are currently under active consideration in my Department, and planning for an implementation strategy is under way. Among the recommendations is that the quota for disadvantaged students be increased to 5% and that it apply to all courses. The recent publication of the report undertaken by Professor Malcolm Skilbeck and Dr. Helen Connell for the Higher Education Authority, Access and Equity in Higher Education, acknowledges the growing movement to advance equity in higher education and notes that considerable progress has occurred, notably through the substantial quantitative growth of third level places and the establishment of a greater diversity of institutions and programmes over the past decades. However, the report notes, among other things, the continued serious under-representation of lower socio-economic groups. Arising from this, the Higher Education Authority intends to host a major forum on equity issues in higher education in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning identified a critical need to concentrate expansion of the adult education system on the needs of those who are most marginalised, with minimal or no educational qualifications and to increase the range of options within the system. The vocational training opportunities scheme caters especially for unemployed people who wish to improve their education for the purpose of securing employment. A study has been commissioned by my Department on how that scheme may be made more effective in reaching long-term unemployed people. A draft report has been completed and is being examined with a view to finalisation.</P>
      <P>Within the national development plan, a sum of £1.027 billion has been earmarked for a programme to cater for existing and expansion needs. The back to education initiative involves the merging and continuation of existing levels of provision under Youthreach, senior traveller training centres, the vocational training opportunities scheme and post-leaving certificate courses, allied to new forms of provision of the courses. It will provide opportunities to return to learning for adults and provide a re-entry route for those who wish to upgrade their skills in line with emerging needs. The back to education initiative will emphasise flexibility of provision for participants to engage in whatever level of provision is appropriate to their needs, and to mix and match modular options and subject choices in accordance with their interests. Part-time options will be offered in the mornings, night-time, weekends, and sandwich or summer courses in line with local needs. Tuition will be free of charge to unemployed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental group has been examining how best the literacy service can cater for unemployed people. It comprises the Departments of Education and Science, Social Community and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FÁS, the National Adult Literacy Agency and the local employment service and literacy providers. An interim report has been submitted to Government recommending targets and timescales for an expansion of funding for the adult literacy service. These are being met within the context of the national development plan under which £73.6 million is being provided for adult literacy; an increase in provision of foundation and level one programmes under the VTOS <Col N="1337" /> element of the back to education initiative to enable progression from basic literacy into ongoing programmes, also in the national development plan; and an expansion of FÁS community employment literacy programmes and increased flexibility to enable a combination and mixing of schemes to enable vocational education committees and FÁS to respond to needs. FÁS is currently expanding successful pilots in this area to every FÁS region.</P>
    <P>A pilot adult guidance service is currently being developed in a number of locations around the country to encourage unemployed people to engage with the adult education service. The service is involved in initial outreach, particularly in the fields of literacy and basic education, vocational information, guidance and orientation. The service will also provide advice in dealing with learning fears as well as counselling and access to expert services for those in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a recent OECD publication Education at a Glance 2000. Ireland participated in the third international mathematics and science study &ndash; TIMMS &ndash; conducted in over 40 countries, during the school year 1994-95. The survey was conducted on eight grade pupils which, in the Irish context, involved mostly second-level pupils in first or second year.</P>
      <P>A moderate degree of absenteeism among eight grade pupils was taken to be 5% as a basis of comparison. Ireland and Australia had a 7% rate of absenteeism, the third highest among the countries surveyed. High levels of student absenteeism can have a negative effect on a student's opportunity to learn and may be harmful to a student's learning achievement. In Ireland's case, the mean mathematics achievement in the test was higher in those Irish schools that had a lower absenteeism rate, less than 5%, than in other Irish schools reporting absenteeism rates greater than 5%. This was similar to most countries. Nevertheless, the mean mathematics achievement in Ireland was 527 against an OECD mean of 524 and this ranked Ireland as seventh among the participating countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about high levels of absenteeism. There is a number of factors contributing to absenteeism including educational disadvantage. Since 1995 a number of initiatives have been taken to assist schools serving disadvantaged areas improve many aspects of their learning environment. These initiatives would be expected to result in improved attendance among disadvantaged students. These initiatives include an extension of the home school community liaison <Col N="1338" /> scheme; enhanced capitation for all second schools serving disadvantaged areas; introduction of the eight to 15 early school leavers' initiative and the stay-in-school retention initiative; improved resources to schools in terms of teacher allocation and capital resources; and, school development planning.</P>
    <P>In addition, the junior certificate school programme was introduced to provide an alternative junior cycle curriculum for pupils who might otherwise leave school. I have announced recently my intention to expand this scheme on a phased basis to all interested schools. The leaving certificate applied is now available in more than 200 schools and centres to meet the needs of those who find the leaving certificate and leaving certificate vocational programme unsuitable.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill is before the Oireachtas at present. The Bill will provide the statutory underpinning for a new structure and framework to tackle the causes and symptoms of non-school attendance. The National Educational Welfare Board will co-ordinate the activities of all those involved, in so far as they relate to matters connected with school attendance. The board will identify the causes of poor school attendance on the part of certain children and the adoption of measures for its prevention.</P>
    <P>The issue of absenteeism is not a simple one and in order successfully to address the issue the approaches employed must be wide-ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment. I have outlined the major steps being taken to address the issue and I am confident that these steps will provide the basis for developing and refining strategies to counter school non-attendance in the future.</P>

      <P>Teachers in national schools are class teachers rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. Accordingly, applicants must satisfy the Department of Education and Science that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers trained in another member state of the European Union, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by the Department of Education and Science, but who do not possess <Col N="1339" /> an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. During this period of provisional recognition these teachers are remunerated to the same extent as fully qualified teachers. The period of provisional recognition has recently been extended from three to five years, in order to allow such teachers adequate time to prepare for and pass the Irish language examination and also in response to the ongoing teacher supply issue at primary level.</P>
    <P>At the moment, teachers from outside of the European Union are not eligible for the five-year period of provisional recognition that applies to teachers from the European Union and, accordingly, cannot take up positions in mainstream primary schools until they meet the Department's Irish language requirements. In order to meet this requirement teachers must have obtained a pass in the scrúdú cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge &ndash; SCG &ndash; and provide certification that they have attended an approved three week residential course in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>However, non EU teachers whose qualifications have been assessed as satisfactory, but who are not entitled to teach in mainstream primary schools because they do not possess the Irish language qualification, are recognised by my Department to teach in special schools and classes where Irish is not a curricular requirement. This recognition has also been recently extended to allow such teachers to take up positions as resource teachers for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>I have asked officials within my Department to examine the possibility of extending the same treatment to non-EU teachers as is currently applied to teachers trained within the EU. I hope to be in a position to announce the result of the examination referred to above shortly. Finally, my Department is finalising a comprehensive circular on the recognition of teacher qualifications at primary level and it is intended that it will be issued to all schools early in the next school year.</P>

      <P>Conscious of the difficulties experienced by schools during the oral and practical examinations, earlier this year my Department established a working group representative of the partners in education, including school principals, to review current arrangements and to make recommendations for a new structure that would address the problems of the current system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group began its work by consider<Col N="1340" /> ing the merits of various proposals, advanced in submissions from the partners, in relation to the examinations. It emerged early in their work that there was no simple solution to the problems caused by the current examining model which requires teacher absence from schools.</P>
    <P>My Department proposed, within the working group, a new model entirely for oral examinations that would eliminate altogether the need for teachers to be absent from their own schools. This model would involve the teachers within a school acting as exam facilitators in order to produce a tape or video recording of each student demonstrating his-her oral skills. The recording would be examined subsequently by an external examiner. This model would provide considerable flexibility for schools in deciding when to conduct the tests and it should also prove to be less pressurised for candidates than the current model. Work is continuing within my Department on developing this model including the type of test material that might be used. A fuller evaluation of its merits should be possible when the work on possible test material is completed in the coming months. I look forward to receiving the findings of the working group in due course.</P>

      <P>In drafting the disclosure regulations on life assurance policies, the precise format of which cannot be finalised until after the final enactment of the Insurance Bill, prior extensive consultations with interested parties were held. Further views and observations continue to be entertained, so I am aware of the views referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are sound reasons for compulsory disclosure of commission levels to consumers. In general, disclosure enables consumers to make an informed and rational choice of products available, thus leading to enhanced competition to the benefit of the consumer. Disclosure of commission should therefore exercise a downward pressure on the levels of commission. It should also minimise the scope for mis-selling, including <Col N="1343" /> churning of policies. Moreover, disclosure of commission is becoming the norm throughout the financial services sector. Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, disclosure of commission is required.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the observations from representatives of independent advisers, our Department sought the expert assistance of the Society of Actuaries to frame the disclosure regulations in such a way as to avoid unfairly discriminating between commission disclosure by brokers and other insurance intermediaries, on the one hand, and disclosure of remuneration for salesforces employed directly by the insurers themselves or through tied agents such as banks and building societies, on the other. A formula has been devised with the co-operation of the Society of Actuaries, which will achieve equivalence of disclosure, as far as is practicable, between the different distribution channels.</P>

    <P>As the person named had 9.2 livestock units he did not qualify under this category. His livestock units are determined as follows: milk quota of 5887 gallons divided by 897 = 6.5, rounded up to seven; special beef premium = 1.2; suckler cow premium = 1. Total = 9.2.</P>
    <P>He was then considered under category D which was reserved for farmers who did not qualify under the priority categories A, B or C. Under this category, eligible farmers with no livestock units were allocated quota first, then those with one livestock unit and so on. All the available quota was distributed under category D to eligible farmers with eight livestock units or less.</P>
    <P>As the person named had 9.2 livestock units, there was insufficient quota available to enable an allocation to be made to him under category D.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an early retirement pension on 23 December 1999. A very large number of applications was received at that time because the closing date for entry to the then existing scheme was 31 December. The backlog in applications is now being given priority by local office staff and my Department is making every effort to expedite the processing of outstanding applications.</P>
      <P>In no case does the processing time result in a financial loss to a retiring farmer. The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

      <P>Following a lengthy period of consultation involving member states and including the European Parliament, the European Commission last month adopted the guidelines for Leader. The guidelines outline the template for the drafting by member states of operational programmes to be submitted to the commission for approval and clearance.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in the process of preparing the operational programmes for the implementation of both the Leader+ and the national Leader programmes for submission to the European Commission. It is hoped to place advertisements shortly inviting expressions of interest from local groups on the application and implementation of the programmes in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Consultation with relevant parties is required by the European Commission in the preparation of the draft operational programmes and a significant degree of consultation has already taken place. The consultative process is ongoing and a number of advisory seminars are also being arranged on a regional basis to provide information to prospective participants in the new Leader arrangements.</P>
      <P>Now that the guidelines for Leader+ are in place, I am concerned to ensure that the draft operational programmes for Leader+, together with the mainstream Leader programme proposed under the national development plan, are completed and forwarded to the commission with a view to obtaining clearance and the prompt establishment of funding activity to 2006. While the European Commission procedure provides for a period of months for formal negotiation and clearance of programmes, I will press for acceptance of our programmes at the earliest time possible.</P>

      <P>A European, wide alert in relation to admission to hospitals in Glasgow of 20 injecting drug users in the two weeks ending 15 May was issued through the national disease surveillance centre in Dublin to the departments of public health in health boards. Nine of the 20 people died and others were admitted to intensive care units. The illnesses that were caused appeared to be related to injecting heroin into tissues which caused severe damage, with a rapid deterioration in health over a number of days, which developed into a septic shock syndrome.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority passed the information on to the chief executives of accident and emergency hospitals, for the attention of all staff, and to GPs. Staff are being asked to report back to the area health boards with any relevant information. In addition, notices have gone out to all drug treatment clinics, health centres, GPs and the general public advising drug users of the need for extreme care and vigilance as there may be contaminated heroin in circulation. A freephone helpline, operating 24 hours, seven days per week has been set up offering advice to heroin misusers and information and referral to treatment centres. The ERHA is also advising drug users who notice an adverse reaction to immediately seek help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the middle of April 2000, 15 injecting heroin users have been confirmed with illnesses which meet the case definition of injecting drug <Col N="1353" /> user with evidence of a severe inflammatory process. Of the 15 cases eight have died. Four of the 15 cases and two of those who died are women. The ERHA is working closely with the authorities in Glasgow, the national disease surveillance centre and the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta to isolate and identify the exact cause of the illness but, to date, no definite cause has been established.</P>
    <P>The three area health boards are expanding their services to meet the increased demand for such services. This includes the placement of additional outreach workers in high risk areas and increased treatment capacity at a number of locations, including James's Street, Crumlin, and Finglas.</P>

      <P>Information on drug related deaths is collected by the Central Statistics Office for the general mortality register in accordance with guidelines developed by the World Health Organisation using international classification of diseases code 9, which includes deaths due to drug dependance and poisoning by opiates and other narcotics. In the past few years there has been ongoing discussion between the drugs misuse division of the Health Research Board, the Central Statistics Office and other relevant actors, and efforts have been made to improve the reliability of reports of drug related deaths. These deaths are based on death certificates which often give the main cause of death as a medical condition other than drug use, although drug use may have been implicated in the death. The drugs misuse research division is also working with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction &ndash; EMCDDA &ndash;  to apply a new drug related deaths &ndash; DRD &ndash; standard definition which would include deaths from causes such as road traffic accidents where drug misuse was involved. The intention would be that this standard definition would be applied across EU member states and thus allow for the comparison of data. In addition, arising from a workshop which was held last August to discuss this issue I believe discussions are under way on the possibility of establishing a special register to record drug related deaths in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Figures requested by the Deputy (applying the ICD 9 definition) are as follows:&ndash;</P>

    <P>We also know that, between April and the end of May 2000, the ERHA received notifications of 19 heroin related deaths from the City and County <Col N="1354" /> Coroner's office. This information was received in the context of the ERHA's investigation into deaths of heroin misusers with evidence of severe inflammatory process. We are uncertain, however whether these cases fit into the ICD9 definition.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to provide hard data on the number of illegal drug users. The Health Research Board is working with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction on various prevalence estimates which would be comparable on a European-wide basis. Various estimates have been made on the number of opiate misusers in the country. Because of the illicit nature of drug misuse it is difficult to get a clear estimate of the extent of the problem. Present estimates range from around 8,500 to 13,500. The ministerial task force suggested a figure of 8,000, confined mainly to Dublin city. The Health Research Board report on treated drug misuse in Ireland in 1998 gave a figure of 5,076 cases treated in the Eastern Health Board area and 967 in the rest of the country receiving treatment. It must be emphasised however, that this is the number of people receiving treatment, and the number of people misusing drugs would be greatly in excess of this figure.</P>
      <P>In 1990 the number of cases presenting for treatment in the greater Dublin area was 1,752. There was no national estimate in 1990. In 1995 the number of cases in the greater Dublin area was 3,593, while the number in other health boards was 803, giving a total of 4,496.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the two tables below for the years 1990, 1995 and 1999. Figures for the year 2000 are not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Table 1 refers to direct alcohol-related deaths. Diagnosis codes regarded as being directly related to alcohol consumption include cirrhosis of the liver, chronic pancreatitis, alcohol-induced gastritis and a number of other conditions. Abuse of alcohol can also leave individuals vulnerable to malignancies, infectious diseases, circulatory and respiratory disorders, digestive and urinary system diseases, accidents, violence and suicide. These causes cover the majority of all deaths occurring each year, and estimates of the pro<Col N="1355" /> portion of deaths within each category caused directly by alcohol are not currently available.</P>
    <P>With respect to tobacco, a study by Richard Peto and others, titled, &ldquo;Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries, 1995-2000&rdquo;  constructed a methodology to estimate the proportion of deaths from each smoking-related cause in each <Col N="1356" /> developed country due directly to smoking. The estimate for Ireland amounts to approximately 6,000 deaths annually or 20% of all mortality.</P>
    <P>Table 2 shows deaths from all causes which are regarded as smoking-related. Approximately half of all deaths fall into this category. Based on the methodology described above, up to 40% of these deaths may have tobocco consumption as their ultimate cause.</P>

      <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991 removed the entitlement to combine public and private elements of out-patient or in-patient care at the same time. The position now is that every patient is entitled to full public hospital services including public accommodation and public consultant care. Alternatively one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, agreement was reached with the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association that, when private clinical consultation is obtained, it is reasonable to assume that all imaging or other investigations which are specifically relevant to this clinical consultation should be regarded as private and, therefore, subject to charge, unless <Col N="1357" /> they are carried out for the purpose of previous public clinical consultation.</P>

This plan is being jointly funded by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and my Department.</P>
      <P>As part of this project new residential and day services have been completed in Oldtown, County Dublin and are being commissioned. This new facility will provide accommodation for 30 persons from the St Ita's campus.

      <P>The work of the project and design teams on an overall development control plan for the hospital campus, which includes new accommodation to be provided for the intellectual disability services, is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>In addition to the £3 million mentioned above, capital funding of £500,000 in 1999 and a further £1 million this year have been allocated by my Department towards the costs associated with this development. It is anticipated that the planning and tendering process will be completed by early 2001 with building commencing on site towards the end of the first quarter of that year.

      <P>St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane: There are currently 47 nursing vacancies at the hospital. The ERHA assures me that every effort is being made to fill these vacancies by way of advertising in national and local newspapers, periodicals and via recruitment campaigns in the United Kingdom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department issued guidelines in 1985 to health boards on the classification of cases awaiting orthodontic treatment in descending order of severity or handicap. Category A: The most severe cases e.g. cleft lip and palate. Category B: Cases with a functional handicap e.g. marked disproportion between the upper and lower jaws. Category C: Non-handicapping cases but having a need for treatment.</P>
      <P>The North Western Health Board, and a number of other health boards, are currently using a severity index, which is known as the index of treatment need &ndash; IOTN. This index details a methodology for assessing the need for treatment. The IOTN has five categories ranging from 1, no need for treatment, to 5, great need. In the North Western Health Board, patients in categories 4 and 5 currently receive orthodontic treatment. In general, boards using the IOTN provide treatment to category 5, the category of greatest need, and extend treatment to category 4 as resources permit.</P>
      <P>In the North Western Health Board, the waiting time for treatment for category 5 patients is less than a year while the waiting time for category 4 patients is currently three years. Waiting times in other boards using the IOTN are similar.</P>
      <P>A recommendation in the report of the review group on orthodontic services, &ldquo;The Moran Report&rdquo;, is that all health boards adopt the IOTN to prioritise patients for treatment. A comprehensive response to health boards on the implementation of the recommendations in the Moran Report will be issued by my Department very shortly.</P>
      <P>Health board orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. This year I am providing an additional £1.45 million to health boards on an ongoing basis to further the development of their orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>The position in this country is that the price, ex-manufacturer, of drugs and medicines prescribable and reimbursable in the general medical services &ndash; GMS &ndash;  scheme and community drug schemes is controlled through multi-annual agreements between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.</P>
      <P>The current agreement provides that the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted United Kingdom wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products. Within these limits, it is a matter for the various manufacturers to determine the amounts that the various component elements contribute to the price of a medicinal product as placed on the market in this country. These costs would include elements to recover their research and development costs and would be in addition to the costs of the various component raw materials, production and of marketing.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current agreement with the industry represents value for money for the taxpayer. I am not aware of any &ldquo;deceptive industry pricing practices&rdquo; but would be happy to examine this further if the Deputy has particular products or practices in mind.</P>

Low immunisation rates among the population was not surprising given the gradual breakdown of medical services in Kosovo since 1989. An immunisation programme which offered immunisation to all refugees was put in place.</P>
      <P>Twelve Kosovar refugees, 1.3%, were diagnosed with tuberculosis, none of which were considered infectious. Twenty six refugees, 2.8%, were diagnosed with hepatitis B. The incidence of hepatitis B was lower than the expected rate of 5-6%.</P>
      <P>The health boards are statutorily responsible for the control and prevention of infectious diseases. My Department has advised all health boards of the necessity to establish appropriate arrangements to offer asylum seekers screening for certain infectious diseases and, where necessary, follow-up treatment.</P>
      <P>In recent months there has been a large increase in the number of persons applying for asylum in Ireland. In order to address these developments, three reception centres have been developed in Dublin. Medical screening is provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority in conjunction with these centres. These arrangements will enable screening to be offered to a greater number of asylum seekers in an integrated manner during the initial reception and processing of applications phase and so facilitate maximum uptake levels.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the situation where the number of cases of meningitis increased by almost 20% in 1999 when compared to 1998, in view of the fact that Ireland has one of the highest incidents of meningitis compare to Europe.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>The number of cases of bacterial meningitis notified to my Department in 1998 and 1999 was 490 and 587 respectively. The increased level of notifications of bacterial meningitis and related conditions in recent years is in part attributable to the greatly increased awareness among health professionals and the general public, as well as improved techniques for diagnosis of the condition. Nonetheless, while there continues to be much research in relation to meningitis, it is not fully understood why Ireland experiences such a different pattern of disease to other countries in Europe and elsewhere. It should be noted that, despite the increased incidence of meningitis, there has not been a corresponding increase in mortality from this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group on bacterial meningitis, <Col N="1363" /> which was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of my Department's deputy chief medical officer and which published reports in 1997 and 1999, includes among its members a range of medical experts who are closely involved in dealing with meningococcal disease in Ireland. The group has prepared and issued detailed advice on the surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningitis and it continues to monitor developments, including the outcome of research, at national and international level, so as to ensure that its advice is in line with best practice.</P>
    <P>A new conjugate vaccine to protect against Group C meningococcal disease, which represents about 40% of the disease in Ireland, is expected to become available later this year and planning is under way for its introduction into the primary childhood immunisation programme and for it to be given to older children and young people in a &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; programme. It will also be important that, even after the Group C vaccine is introduced, vigilance is maintained, as there will still be a significant risk of people contracting Group B disease, which represents about 60% of the cases occurring in Ireland at present.</P>
    <P>In recent years surveillance systems in relation to meningitis have been significantly improved. Health boards are required to notify details of cases to my Department within 24 hours of them occurring and these arrangements are operating effectively. My Department has also funded the establishment of the Meningococcal Reference Laboratory at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street and the diagnostic service provided by this laboratory has had a significant impact on case ascertainment and confirmation of the diagnosis of invasive meningococcal disease. As part of the preparations for the introduction of the new vaccine, the Meningococcal Reference Laboratory is undertaking a study to establish the sub-strains of Group C meningococcal disease currently circulating in Ireland. This will enable an analysis to be carried out after the vaccine has been introduced to establish its effect on the sub-strains of the disease in circulation.</P>
    <P>The development of the national disease surveillance centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases, including meningitis. The centre has already developed a meningococcal disease database, which will enable the pattern of this disease to be analysed in detail.</P>

      <P>Data on the weekly patient bed cost in each public hospital is not routinely collected by my department. However, the in-patient cost per bed-day for the 31 acute public hospitals which participated in the national casemix programme in 1998, the latest date for which audited data is available, is available and is detailed in the following table. It should be noted that there are many factors which affect in-patient cost per bed-day and these include the complexity of the workload, teaching obligations, tertiary referrals, etc. The figures exclude costs and activity attributable to day-cases, out-patient services, long-stay cases, dialysis, obstetrics and psychiatry and do not take account of capital costs.</P>

      <P>Officers of my Department have ongoing discussions with the Irish Medicines Board in relation to their financial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the policy, since the board was established in 1995, that the board should be self-financing in relation to the functions devolved to <Col N="1367" /> it under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995. Section 13 of the Act provides for the making of regulations in respect of the payment of fees to the Irish Medicines Board in relation to the grant or renewal of licences by the board under section 32 of the Act. Section 14 of the Act provides for the making of charges by the board in respect of services provided by it, subject to my approval. All of these fees and charges may be reviewed from time to time to take account of any shortcomings in income.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board is not in financial difficulties. It makes the point in the recently published strategic plan that its fees are primarily geared towards new applications rather than towards maintenance of existing authorisations. However, it has also informed me that in stating this it was intended to act as an indicator to those who pay its fees i.e. industry, of how the board might wish to restructure its fees at some future unspecified date.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has received funding this year from my Department for the first time to support new activities that it has been asked to take on. These include activities relating to enforcement, medical devices and controlled drugs under the misuse of drugs Act. Some of these functions will require amendment to the relevant primary legislation.</P>

      <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is due to present its first report shortly. The main service, training, research and career issues and the principles and approaches to be adopted have, to a large measure, been agreed by the Medical Manpower Forum. The medical organisations are represented on the Medical Manpower Forum. It has also been agreed that the introduction of these changes should coincide with an extension of the core hospital working day. This is necessary if one of the key principles of the forum is to be achieved, that is, the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals.</P>

      <Quest>if he will rectify the anomaly where an old age pensioner in receipt of rent allowance automatically loses the budget increase in pension in view of the fact that the rental allowance is reduced pound for pound.</Quest>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mort<Col N="1371" /> gage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which a person is required to pay from his or her own resources towards accommodation costs.</P>
      <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, all applicants, including pensioners, are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent.    </P>
      <P>The current supplementary welfare allowance rate for a single person is £76 per week. Any increase in income over and above that rate will result in a decrease of that amount in the rent supplement rate payable.</P>
      <P>For example, in the budget 2000 rate increases which came into effect from the beginning of May 2000 the old age non-contributory pension rose by £7 from £78.50 to £85.50. The social welfare allowance rate rose by £4 from £72 to £76. A single person on a non-contributory pension is now in receipt of £9.50 per week above the supplementary welfare allowance rate and would therefore be liable to pay that amount plus the minimum contribution of £6 towards their rent. This means that a single person in receipt of a rent supplement will be left with £70 per week after payment of rent regardless of their primary payment.</P>
      <P>This manner of calculation of rent supplement will be examined as part of the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has been established to carry out the review and a report is expected by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Any proposals for changes in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned <Col N="1372" /> made a claim to disability benefit on 10 May 2000. She stated that she had been incapable of work since 19 June 1999 and had sent medical certificates to her employer to that effect, but had not realised until recently that she could claim disability benefit. She submitted retrospective medical evidence and the deciding officer accepted that there was good cause for her delay in claiming. Her claim was authorised for payment with effect from 11 November 1999, that is backdated for six months which was the maximum period of backdating possible.</P>
      <P>Since her claim was decided, regulations have been made which extend, in certain circumstances, the possible period of backdating in respect of a number of benefits, including disability benefit. Under these provisions payment of disability benefit may be made beyond the six month period if: the delay in claiming was due to incorrect information having been given by the Department; or the extent of the illness, or a <i>force majeure,</i> prevented a person from claiming earlier; or the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</P>
      <P>The Department will be in contact with the person concerned with a view to determining if there are grounds for further extending the period of back-payment on her case.</P>

Such rules may include an obligation with regard to the provision of subtitles and sign language usage but this will be a matter for the new commission.  </P>

      <P>The special education review committee recommended that the general criteria for establishing remedial need should relate to pupils who have been identified as being at or below the tenth percentile on standardised test in basic literacy and numeracy. The committee also recommended that the caseload of a remedial teacher catering for a single school should be 40 pupils.</P>

    <P>Since September 1999, the remedial teacher service has been extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios may also <Col N="1376" /> seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service.</P>
    <P>Schools which can demonstrate a need for such support will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>
    <P>Resource posts are sanctioned where a number of children with special educational needs, arising from a disability, are fully integrated into mainstream national schools where there is no other adequate supports teaching resources available to the children.

    <P>Resource teaching posts may be sanctioned on a full-time basis, either in a single school or in a cluster of schools, providing there are sufficient children with special educational needs arising from a disability to warrant a full-time post. Alternatively, part-time hours may be sanctioned to provide support teaching for individual children where there are insufficient children with special educational needs to warrant the allocation of a full-time post. The criteria and procedure for the allocation of such posts were notified to school by means of a circular issued by my Department in 1999.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the procedures available to schools to avail of additional support or moneys from his Department where such a school is experiencing difficulties, especially where a school can not make up the shortfall between the capitation and other grants and the actual cost of running the school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding arrangements at second level reflect the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive and VEC sectors. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, which are privately managed institutions, my Department meets the cost of teachers salaries and allowances and makes an annual <i>per capita</i> grant towards recurrent costs.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from next September is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. The flexibility given to schools under this initiative will be supported by the putting in place of guidelines, which will strike the right balance between allowing a reasonable level of discretion and achieving the implementation of national policy priorities. In addition, secondary schools will also benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year with a further increase of £8 planned for this year. Schools have welcomed these improvements.</P>
      <P>Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government assumed office in 1997. It was increased by £5 in 1998 and £10 in 1999, bringing the standard grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes an increase of 33% over that period. In addition, the grant will be increased by a further £11 by the end of the 2000-01 school year. Furthermore, an additional grant of £30 per pupil is paid in respect of all pupils of primary schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department is further extending the scheme of additional capitation grants for secretarial and caretaking assistance with effect from September 2000. This will mean that for the first time all primary schools will receive grant aid towards secretarial and caretaking services. Furthermore over the past two years <Col N="1378" /> all primary schools have received grants for materials for infant classes, science materials, library books and reading materials, the purchase of which would previously have had to be made from the normal capitation funding.</P>
    <P>I would add however that the running costs of primary schools are not budgeted for individually by my Department and it would not be feasible to grant aid over 3,000 schools in such a manner. The rules of procedure for boards of management of primary schools specifically state that overdrafts or other forms of debts or excesses of expenditure over income must be approved by the patron, and should be avoided except for limited periods, and where the board is satisfied that the overdraft or debt can be cleared by the board. Therefore where a school board of management has incurred expenditure in excess of its income, it is a matter for the board of management, if necessary in consultation with the patron, to address the matter.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for primary and second level schools and I will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is pursuing a five year development plan in the young offender area. The plan envisages a major refurbishment of some of the existing custodial facilities, coupled with measures aimed at ensuring that the custodial facilities operated under my Department are capable of meeting their obligations under the forthcoming Children Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Trinity House-Oberstown Complex in Lusk, County Dublin, the development plans include the development of a new highly specialised secure unit to cater for six children. The architectural planning of this project is progressing with a view to the invitation of tenders later this year. The development of pre-release units to cater for young offenders who are nearing completion of their sentence. A design team was recently appointed to progress this project. Major refurbishment of both Oberstown boys and girls centres, leading to the eventual replacement of the existing residential units. Arrangements are currently under way for the appointment of a design team to progress this matter. Two of the three units which comprise Trinity House have already undergone very significant refurbishment over the past year. Further refurbishment work is currently being undertaken at Trinity House.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of a secure fence to encompass the special schools complex at Lusk, consultants engaged by my Department are preparing the necessary technical documentation to allow tenders to be invited shortly for this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> The planning of this project was delayed to allow for some changes to the details of the proposed fence resulting from the range of related developments on the campus.</P>

      <P>An inspector of my Department recently visited this school and discussed the enrolment projections for the 2000-01 school year with the principal.</P>
      <P>The position is that the school authorities do not expect that the enrolment required for the sanctioning of a post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria, as outlined in Circular Letter 11/2000, will be achieved in September 2000. The overall enrolment required on 30 September 2000 to meet the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria is 478 pupils. Accordingly, it will not be possible to sanction an additional teaching post for the next school year.</P>
      <P>In the event that the projections in regard to intake to the school for September 2000 alter in the intervening period, my Department would be prepared to reconsider an application from the managerial authority under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria.</P>

      <P>The report and recommendations of the <Col N="1386" /> expert advisory group on certificate examinations on the arrangements for the assessment of candidates with special needs in certificate examinations was published recently. This followed lengthy consultation and consideration by the group of this complex and difficult area.</P>
      <P>The group recognised that there are cases where many of the elements of a subject that are marked in the examination are accessible to a student but some, because of a particular difficulty the student has, are not. An example is the aural component of a language subject that may not be accessible to a student with a hearing impairment. The group pointed out that it is reasonable that the student sit for examination in the components of the subject in which achievement was possible and that he-she be exempted from the specific and identifiable component. What this means is that the national standard for assessment should be modified to accommodate the student and this modification is enabled by including an explanatory note with the results.</P>
      <P>These measures make the examination system more flexible and responsive to the needs of students who would otherwise have difficulty with some examination subjects because of their special needs. This represents a significant advance in the inclusiveness of the examination system. In fact there is a small increase in the number of candidates availing of special arrangements this year although candidature generally has declined.</P>
      <P>The key assurance I want to give the Deputy and all interested parties is that in implementing these measures my Department will confine any explanatory note strictly to the assessment issue in the subject or subjects concerned. There will be no reference to the special needs of the candidate. The note will explain only how the standard national assessment was modified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1999, my Department formally requested the Office of Public Works to undertake a pilot survey of 196 schools in the south-east to determine the location, type, form and condition of any asbestos material present and the steps necessary to manage the problem. The intention of my Department in conducting the sample survey was to obtain information on the likely scale and extent of the presence of asbestos in school buildings nationwide. The initial survey was completed in July 1999 by a firm of specialist consultants commissioned by the Office of Public Works. It identified an asbestos presence in some form or another in 59 of the 196 schools surveyed, that is, about 30%.</P>
      <P>Although generally speaking the condition of the material was found to be good and posed no immediate health risk, its removal where possible was recommended and a programme of works was commenced immediately with funding made available from my Department. Remediation work has now been completed in the 59 schools identified in the survey.</P>
      <P>The initial survey has since been extended to all schools both primary and post-primary, and the management authorities and principals of every school were informed of this in December 1999. Following on this phase of the survey, a programme of works involving remediation is currently under way in 156 schools and contracts have been awarded or are being processed in all cases. Total expenditure in 2000 on the programme is likely to be in the region of £4 million.</P>
      <P>Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements to undertake the work in accordance with the relevant health and safety legislation are made by my Department and the Office of Public Works. The entire cost of the programme of detection and removal is being borne by my Department. The necessary level of funding will continue to be allocated to the programme as a priority.</P>
      <P>The survey of schools in Donegal has now been completed and I will arrange for my Department to forward the information requested by the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The enrolment policy of each special school is a matter for the board of management. My Department does not have information on the number of pupils awaiting special school placement.</P>
      <P>Special schools are established in central locations in response to the level of need presenting in the general area. I am generally satisfied with the overall capacity of the special schools in the areas referred to by the Deputy. My Department will sanction additional teaching and-or special needs assistant support when requested by special schools to accommodate increasing numbers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a major new initiative was announced in November 1998 in the area of special education under which all children assessed as having special educational needs are entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The measures involved are aimed at ensuring that all children with special educational needs, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system.</P>
      <P>The key measures of this initiative include the introduction of a formalised system of special teaching and child care support for all children attending school on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational needs.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to view each pupil's special needs on an individual basis. For some children the nature of the special need may be such that the child can perform quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial or resource teacher. Where more serious cases of difficulties arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to such children.</P>
      <P>Where special needs are concerned, flexibility of response is essential. Every case needs to be assessed on its individual merit. The level and type of response will reflect the special need involved.</P>

      <P>There are currently 43 psychologists employed in the National Educational Psychological Service. Improvement and expansion of the service offered by NEPS will begin when additional psychologists are in place. I anticipate that, by the end of the year 2000, nearly 100 psychologists will be in post. This is half of the current final target of 200 psychologists proposed for NEPS so, by the end of this year, there should be <Col N="1391" /> a marked improvement in the level of service being offered by the agency.</P>
      <P>Eventually, NEPS psychologists will be organised in ten regions, corresponding to the health board regions. The overall allocation of psychologists to the regions will be largely based on the projected student numbers in each region. In the interests of equity, each cohort of psychologists will be shared among the regions on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, until each region has reached its target staffing quota.</P>
      <P>Within each region, priorities for expansion will be informed by the results of a survey of each county, currently being undertaken by the NEPS psychologists. Among other things, they are examining evidence of disadvantage, the incidence of special needs and the level of access to other psychological services. Letters and submissions on behalf of particular schools and areas that have been sent to NEPS will be included in the survey as evidence of need.</P>

      <P>There are currently three national educational psychological service, psychologists assigned to County Kildare. The national policy advisory board of NEPS has been set up to advise me on the development of that service. The board will be advising me on possible strategies to meet the current need for psychological support in schools, taking account of evidence of disadvantage, incidence of special needs and the level of access to other psychological services. In the interest of equity, it is proposed that new psychologists will be distributed on a pro rata basis among the regions until each has reached its target number, which will be determined by the evidence of need. During the development phase of NEPS, the needs of all schools, including those in north County Kildare, will be considered by the board when assigning new psychologists to schools.</P>

      <P>Further to my reply to the Deputy's question on 19 April 2000, architectural planning for the facilities in question is proceeding at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the allocation of funding to capital projects by my Department depends on a number of factors such as the vol<Col N="1395" /> ume of applications on hand, the rate of progress of architectural design, site acquisition, the granting of planning permission and the outcome of the tender process. Delays can arise at any stage <Col N="1396" /> of the process, consequently it is not possible to say when projects being processed at present will proceed to construction.</P>
    <P>The school authorities will be kept informed of developments.</P>
