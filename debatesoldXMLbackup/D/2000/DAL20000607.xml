      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I met Prime Minister Goh of Singapore in Dublin Castle yesterday. His visit, the first to Ireland by a Prime Minister of Singapore, represents a deepening of our relations with Singapore, as it follows visits to Ireland by both of the Singaporean Deputy Prime Ministers during 1999 and the Tánaiste's visit to Singapore earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister and I held discussions on the development of bilateral relations between our two countries. The Prime Minister welcomed the recent opening of the Irish Embassy in Singapore, as we look forward to the appointment by Singapore of an honorary consul in Dublin later this year. We also discussed the potential for the further development of trade between our countries. I briefed the Prime Minister on the development and the strengths of our economy and emphasised to him the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for inward investment by Singaporean companies seeking to access the European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also discussed the potential for multilateral co-operation between Europe and Asia and Prime Minister Goh informed me of his hopes for the ASEM III Summit in Seoul which takes place in October. Singapore was one of the founders of the ASEM process and I was pleased to remind the Prime Minister that Ireland is hosting the fourth ASEM Young Leaders Symposium in Limerick next week. We were pleased to note that the EU-ASEAN dialogue is set to resume later this year and both look forward to the continuing development of this channel of communication and co-operation between our two regions. I also briefed the Prime Minister on my visit to East Timor earlier this year and we briefly dis<Col N="866" /> cussed the upcoming UN Millennium Summit and the outlook for UN reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach hold any discussions with Prime Minister Goh about the very large arms build-up in East Asia generally where several countries, not just China and Taiwan, are spending a very large amount of money on armaments and did he discuss the considerable instability which seems to exist in the Philippines, for example, as a result of which a number of tourists have been kidnapped by a secessionist group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed those issues although we did not discuss all of the countries involved. We discussed the China-Taiwan relationship and the difficulties experienced since the recent election of the president in Taiwan. Prime Minister Goh outlined his views on how he sees matters developing in this area.</P>
      <P>We also discussed North Korea and South Korea and the Prime Minister seemed satisfied with progress in that area. He emphasised that these countries have finally started to engage in dialogue with other countries. Indonesia is the Prime Minister's particular concern and we spoke at some length about the uncertainty there. The Prime Minister outlined his best assessment of the situation which &ndash; without going into too much detail &ndash; was that Indonesia is still quite unsettled and that a very difficult period lies ahead there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the problems in Indonesia relate to secessionist moves in various parts of the country such as Aceh or do they relate to the relationship between the native Indonesian community and the very large ethnic Chinese community? Which is the more difficult issue from Prime Minister Goh's perspective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Both of those issues pose difficulties but one really needs to talk to somebody dealing with the region; sometimes one forgets, in spite of what has happened in recent years, that Indonesia is a country with a population of 200 million people. The situation in the country has still not stabilised and while there is support for the President, a number of substantive groups are still vying for positions of strength and that is creating many difficulties. The Minister for Defence briefed me on his trip to East Timor where the situation has stabilised and where much progress has been made. Owing to the size of Indonesia's population &ndash; Singapore only has a population of 3.2 million which is not very substantial in relation to a number of other countries &ndash; when there is uncertainty and potential political unrest, it creates great instability for the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to ASEM, I had the honour of attending the first such summit. Does the Taoiseach believe that concrete practical results of a significant nature have arisen from <Col N="867" /> this or has the focus mainly been on simply developing contacts and attending meetings at different levels, which can be made to sound very significant but which may have no great significance beyond the actual event itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton was in Bangkok. That started off the process and then it moved to London. London was really taken up with the Asian financial crisis and did not get really anywhere further than that. Amazingly and miraculously the economies have restored and revived themselves and have now redeemed themselves. This time around there are some practical issues that can be discussed. They would centre around trade and trying to build up trade relationships, and building up memorandums of understanding of substance.</P>
      <P>The concern of European countries would be to set up a trade relationship of a substantial nature and to see if they can get agreement on that. The concern of the ASEAN countries is that they are not just plagued with questions of human rights, where they believe they are doing their best but Europe believes that there is a lot more to be achieved. Around that there is great pressure.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Goh would be happy enough to deal with their development of human rights, although accepting that there is much work to do, but other ASEAN countries are not prepared to discuss these issues so openly and feel that Europe has just a one item agenda and that these meetings are not for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The forum at ministerial level, which was set up as the Deputy will recall, ran into trouble over the Burma/Myanmar issue. I hope that will revive itself. The Foreign Minister who is travelling with the Prime Minister said he hoped to see that up and running later this summer. I have read independently that that might not be so clear but certainly that is the intention. It still has not got down to a fixed agenda but if it does, it will on one side see an improvement in the human rights situation and definitely try to deal with substantive trade issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of human rights, clearly there is a different perception as to what are human rights between those who come from the European tradition of the French Revolution and Tom Paine, etc., and Asian societies where they look more at collective rights than individual rights, the rights of families and matters of that nature. Would the Taoiseach see any value in an intensive dialogue within the ASEAN structure on the idea of human rights and what are the rights and the remedies which are most appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, and that is why yesterday I got into discussion with Prime Minister Goh about his coming to prominence. He came to prominence in his country through a reform package <Col N="868" /> from his predecessor, who &ndash; I think he would not disagree &ndash; at the time &ndash; I was there some years ago &ndash; was seen as hardline and dictatorial. There were not too many freedoms. That has changed substantially.</P>
      <P>Many of the other countries' leaders &ndash; I suppose the Singapore Prime Minister would believe this also &ndash; believe that European countries demand too much of them. They do not disagree that the level of human rights should work its way and bring itself forward to European levels, but it will take time. Sometimes making too much an issue of criticism is not the best way of bringing them forward. The case of what Europe considers is democratic, what is democratisation and what are proper standards of human rights should be put, but in some ways they must be helped and convinced of those moves over a period of time.</P>
      <P>At least a number of the countries accept &ndash; this came up at the last ASEAN meeting &ndash; that they are a long way behind; they are 50 or 60 years behind in their own view. However, since they are wealthy countries, maybe some of the wealthiest countries in the world, it is fair enough to argue that they should be moving on these issues at a greater pace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put the question in another way. Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be a good idea to increase the frequency of the meetings between now and the summit in Nice in light of the very serious issues that are arising where there is a risk, for example, that Ireland might lose its member of the Court of Justice? There is a risk that the reinforced co-operation ideas that are being put forward could leave smaller countries or some individual countries on one side rather than the European Union moving ahead as a unit. In particular, will the Taoiseach comment on the position with regard to the number of Commissioners in the European Union as a result of the likely outcome of the Nice summit? Do we need more meetings of this committee in order to deal with these issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The rule is that I cannot discuss the agenda of the committee because of Cabinet confidentiality. I assure Deputy Bruton that the issues of the intergovernmental conference are now taking up far more time than the monthly meeting of the committee. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I, as well as officials, have been discussing it. Other members of the Government have been discussing it and the Government is being briefed on those meetings. Because of the level of activity on the intergovernmental conference a great deal of discussion is taking place. Those issues centre around the matters we discussed last week &ndash; the Amsterdam leftovers; maintaining our Commissioner, which is still not agreed; the issues within the intergovernmental conference on the weighting of votes and the flexibility issues. These are all issues on which we have set down our position. Within the committee which has been working on this since February &ndash; the intergovernmental conference committee &ndash; we have set down our positions. I have done so publicly as well as here in the House.</P>
      <P>The meeting in Feira will be an opportunity for us to sign off on our position regarding what is realistic to achieve in the second half of the year. We have taken a very straightforward view. We have said where we can move to and where we believe we should be moved to. I want to see the intergovernmental conference completed by Nice and if anyone holds back on any positions that creates difficulties. We must wait to see how the French will handle the Presidency. I met the French Finance Minister, Minister Fabius, who is taking a key role in the intergovernmental conference in France. A number of speeches have been made which I also discussed last week. There are roughly five central issues which will be on the agenda. We look forward to trying to make as much progress as we can in two weeks time in Feira.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's replies, has the Government revised or changed its view in relation to the prospect of publishing a Green Paper setting out very clearly the Irish Government's position on the issues that are cur<Col N="870" /> rently being debated? I know the Taoiseach made a comprehensive speech to the Institute of European Affairs but in view of the necessity to have an informed public who will have to vote in a referendum arising from the Treaty of Nice, does the Government now think it would be advisable if not desirable to publish a Green Paper setting out the Irish Government's position, as an interim contribution to the debate both at home and in the wider European context, perhaps at the end of the Portuguese Presidency, in the first week or so of July? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to rule out that. No one has done so. Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself have set out our negotiating position more than most countries and have almost brought it to a final state. Many other countries are sitting on the fence in terms of where they will go. I do not see much point in that because, if we are to complete it by Nice, we should be progressing with it. Later this evening I will discuss the issues at length with Antonio Guterres.</P>
      <P>We need to get a clear line. The issues involve the Commission and the argument about whether it should be commissioners for the full group or whether there should be a first and second line similar to Ministers and Ministers of State. Another issue is qualified majority voting. We have moved our position on that, as we have on the weighting of votes. Another issue is flexibility, and if I could understand what everyone means by it&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the sense in one of the first decisions of the process of enlargement being that small groups of larger countries would dictate policy, with other member states on the outside from day one. That is not the way to go about creating constructive enlargement. I do not want to rule out what the Deputy said. I would be glad to do it and we could do it easily enough from where we are at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach arrange for members of the Cabinet committee on European affairs to meet the Joint Committee on European Affairs, especially prior to COSAC meetings so the representatives who attend the COSAC meetings have a greater understanding of the Government's thinking on certain matters? We went to the trouble of ensuring that COSAC would be a recognised body under the treaties. Therefore, I am sure the Taoiseach would agree with me that it is essential that the Government keeps in constant contact with the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the provisions for reinforced co-operation or flexibility already exist in the treaty and that the only difficulty from the point of view of some countries is that there must be unanimity to trigger them? Will he indicate if any of the advocates for the triggering of reinforced co-operation without unanimity have produced a single concrete example of something they want to do which they are not able to do at present because of the inoperability of the existing arrangements for reinforced co-operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;No&rdquo; is the answer to that question. The case has been made for flexibility, now reinforced co-operation, for 12 months. I have my suspicions about what is the real agenda. It has not been put forward in any statements by the main players or the people behind this move. It will be put forward in the next Presidency, but it has not yet been put forward. The case seems to be made on the basis that, because enlargement will be so substantial, with a total of 27 or 28 countries, the pace of movement will be too slow in certain areas and that the only way for people to keep the system up and running is to allow groups make individual decisions. That is fraught with danger. That should be an issue that is thought out as part of the enlargement process. Already one could argue that the Euro-11 Group creates its own difficulties without going into the euro argument. It would be far better if everybody was in on that and I hope that will be the case as the year goes on. There might be some other agendas and perhaps at Feira the real agenda will be pushed out.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have explained in some detail on a number of occasions to the House the nature of the understanding between myself and the Independent Deputies who support the Government. I have also pointed out that there is no written agreement between the Government and these Deputies. I have indicated on a number of occasions that there is no great secret that the Deputies concerned have indicated to me what their priorities are and that I in turn have made it known to the House that it is my intention to deal with these issues over the life of the Government, many of which are reflected in the Programme for Government in any event.</P>
      <P>The Deputies have informed this House what these priorities are in some instances and in others they have found other ways of publishing them. The Government has substantially increased expenditure on a whole range of capital programmes and the national development plan has further increased expenditure on these programmes. This will allow Government to accelerate these programmes and complete them earlier than planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has discussed the national development plan and the priority that this Government has given to roads, water and sewage treatment, education, tourism and rural development within it. Many of the priorities indicated by the Deputies are already priorities for their respective local authorities and some are reflected in the <Col N="873" /> review of the programme for Government and in the national development plan.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of copies of the report distributed by his Department, Irish Business in the Information Society - 1999, Research into General Public Attitudes Towards Information and Communications Technology; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15761/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1999 the Information Society Commission engaged MRBI to carry out two research surveys on attitudes towards and usage of information and communications technology, one covering the general public and one on the business community.</P>
      <P>The main findings from these survey results have been published in a series of seven thematic papers, three on the general public and four on the business community. For both surveys the first papers published covered the topline results. The topline results for the general public were published in October 1999 and for the business community in December 1999.</P>
      <P>Subsequent papers dealt with specific areas of interest. In February, findings on early and late adopters of new technology were published, followed in March by the results of research on people's attitudes and expectations. For the business community, findings relating to electronic working, or teleworking, were published in April. In May, two papers were published, one dealing with Internet access and usage within Irish businesses and one addressing skills and training.</P>
      <P>As regards dissemination of the results, given the nature of the Information Society Commission's business, electronic media have been used to the greatest extent possible. Electronic versions of the research papers were posted to the website of the Information Society Commission and can be viewed or downloaded from that site.</P>
      <P>In addition, these survey results were the subject of a communications campaign which involved issuing press releases outlining the main results of the surveys, which has resulted in considerable and on-going media coverage and detailing the survey results in the Information Society Commission's monthly electronic newsletter which is e-mailed to approximately 2,500 recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that it makes sense to use electronic means of communication as much as possible in this area. At the same time, <Col N="874" /> it is recognised that paper copies are also needed. The commission produces a stock of each brochure and approximately 800 paper copies were distributed by post to relevant individuals, including Deputies and Senators. In addition, hard copies of the research papers are made available at appropriate events, seminars and conferences countrywide.</P>
    <P>Given the number of different channels used, it is difficult to estimate the number of individuals who have been in receipt of these survey results. However, there is no doubting the importance of this research in providing reliable indicators of Ireland's development as an information society and in guiding the Information Society Commission and others in the development of policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The nature of the information society is such that it touches on many areas of policy and information such as that revealed by the surveys and is very useful to the relevant Ministers and Departments with responsibility for the various areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that while generally findings have been favourable, one area where the findings have not been so favourable is the use of websites by Irish businesses to sell their goods and services world-wide and that Irish businesses have been slowing in designing and developing their own websites for that purpose?  E-commerce, in a certain way, may be being efficiently used by Irish businesses for buying things but not so efficiently used for selling things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. The use of websites for on-line sales is relatively low according to the surveys. While the business community is concerned about IT skills shortages, it is not investing adequately in training itself and that is shown up in the survey. It is not investing in its own staff and small and medium sized enterprises have been shown to be at greater risk of being left behind in the e-economy.</P>
      <P>It is not an unfair criticism to say, following these results, the papers which went out to them and the opportunity to say this at a number of the seminars held in different parts of the country by IBEC, the small business industry and the Chambers of Commerce during the winter months, that if industry is crying out because of a lack of skills and given that times are not bad for businesses, which could spend some of their own resources and profits in training, they could overcome many of the difficulties because it is in their interests to do so, as highlighted by these surveys.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is right in that websites for on-line sales are low. I do not accept the answer that it is because they cannot get skills. They should be trying to train staff themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that one does not need in-house staff to put up a website and <Col N="875" /> that one simply needs to bring in an outside consultant to advise on what needs to go on to the website and what the site needs to do? One's own staff would be able to operate it thereafter as long as they have access to a server. Why are Irish firms apparently quite slow? Is there a degree of complacency here that the economy is so dynamic they do not need to invest in long-term capacity, such as equipping themselves with a good website?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that which I have given. The answer is what is in the survey. I do not have another answer. The business community is concerned about IT skills shortages and that they have not trained staff. I contend, as Deputy Bruton has, that the setting up and monitoring of a website, and its use for procurement or sales, is not that simple but I do not believe it is that difficult. I have been told by the Information Society Commission and others &ndash; we emphasised this in some of the roadshows which the Information Society Commission undertook throughout the country &ndash; that a bit of effort, training and investment in this area would overcome their problem. The surveys and the papers show the advantages of this.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, from a Government point of view, using websites for procurement is something in which we are actively engaged. I do not want to be critical of the private sector and say that we have overcome this; we have not. This year the Government is putting much resources and effort into procurement policies for local authorities and elsewhere and we have to get that right. For businesses, it is well worth doing this and that is what these papers say very clearly to the business community.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, on Wednesday last, 31 May. We reviewed the recent positive developments in Northern Ireland and looked forward to all the institutions, including the Executive and North-South Bodies, returning to full operational effectiveness. At the meeting, I also emphasised the Government's commitment to the full implementation of the Patten report recommendations and I referred to the concerns expressed by nationalist parties on the Police Bill.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the House previously, I believe that the opportunity is there, within the legislative process, to resolve the issues satisfactorily. It is vital that we do so in order to achieve the overriding objective which must be to have a police service which is representative of both communities and is accepted across all of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions. Is the Taoiseach satisfied in light of recent developments at Westminster and the announcement regarding the amendments that the Secretary of State proposes to table on Committee Stage of the Police Bill that he will be able to recommend to young Nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland that they should join the new police force if those amendments are accepted?</P>
      <P>My second question is one to which I return and with which the Taoiseach is familiar. Did he discuss with the Secretary of State the issue of a parliamentary tier under the Council of the Isles and whether such a tier would subsume the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to the latter question first. I followed up on our exchanges in the House and spoke to the joint chairman of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and asked him to communicate with his counterpart. I hope that we can try to have a proposal. The management group will meet prior to the summer break but a full plenary session will not be held until the autumn. I restated my views, which the Deputy shares. I have stated, perhaps to get over the sovereign Parliament issue, which is the only issue, that the management group could still be the sovereign Parliament and that the plenary groups would be all other Parliaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's first question, the Government's position on the Patten report has <Col N="878" /> been clear from the beginning. We welcome the report and its recommendations and all our effort has been focused on ensuring the full and faithful implementation of the report. While I welcome the proposed changes to the Bill signalled by the Secretary of State yesterday, there is still much work to be done. This has been pointed out strongly to me, particularly by the SDLP. Our objective must be to have a police service which is representative of both communities and accepted throughout Northern Ireland. This means that the new police service must be capable of attracting the support of both communities, including young Nationalists and republicans. The SDLP and Sinn Féin have made it clear that further changes are required. We strongly support that view.</P>
    <P>I will have an opportunity to review all aspects of the Northern Ireland situation, particularly the police Bill, when I meet the Prime Minister Mr. Blair tonight in London. Our discussion will be primarily on that issue. As on decommissioning, there is a strong level of feeling about this issue among political movements, church groups, educational and cultural groups. We must get a handle on it to ensure that we do not allow it sour very positive developments. I will try to do that today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the concessions which the SDLP appear to have won are very positive? Does he also accept that the fact that the SDLP MPs voted on Second Stage for the Bill at Westminster is a positive indication that they believe this is the way forward and that a reformed police force is a possibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get this right, no matter what it takes in terms of time and effort. It is no harm for everybody to be reminded that the Patten commission was established because there was no possibility of achieving agreement during the negotiations on the Good Friday Agreement. It was agreed that the British Government would establish a commission and that its members would be discussed with the Government. We were lucky to get international and local senior figures involved who were prepared to give their time and commitment to this. They did that through an enormously extensive process.</P>
      <P>Without exaggerating, many of those involved in the Patten commission feel their good work is being rowed back. It is very important we clear up the misunderstanding, whether factual or not. We should do it in a cool way, because for people to be involved in upping the ante one way or the other will not resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>I understand Seámus Mallon's strongly held views on this issue. In fairness to him, he has warned about this from day one. His life's work has been in this area and he believes that policing is fundamental to the success of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must get it right. I agree that last night's developments at Westminster were positive. We must listen to those who were involved in the <Col N="879" /> commission. The fundamental issue, which has been put to me by everybody, even over the past week, concerns the line between the policing boards &ndash; this is the central issue that, if resolved, would solve most of the other issues &ndash; the NIO, the security section and inquiries, investigations etc. It must be transparent. If it is not then, because of the history &ndash; I do not want to criticise anything the RUC does &ndash; it will not work. We must get that issue right. I have a job to do tonight to emphasise that people are not merely expressing concern on this but are adamant that the police board must be independent of the Secretary of State and the NIO. Otherwise it will not be trusted by all of the Nationalist community. That is the central issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see any risk that the parliamentary timetable for dealing with the police Bill will carry it forward into the marching season and that there could be an unhelpful conjunction of emotions around policing and the marching issue operating together to create more difficulty than might otherwise occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Committee Stage of the Bill will take a long time. The central issues are getting the Patten recommendations on the policing boards and the district policing boards included on an open and equal basis and getting clarification on the planning power of the boards and the ombudsman. While Deputies Bruton and Quinn ask questions and are familiar with this area, perhaps people in the South do not clearly understand what it means. However, the issue of transparency is deeply held by everybody in the North. It will continue to be a festering sore if there is not clarity on the matter.</P>
      <P>I will say tonight that this has not been an issue for Unionists or loyalists since the Patten report was published last September. Therefore, why are we rowing back on fundamental aspects now? Other issues such as flags, emblems and the title arose, but this matter is fundamental to the structure. I want to do as Deputy Quinn asked. I want to be able to say that young Nationalists and republicans should join. I want to hear the SDLP and Sinn Féin say that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the objections to the arrangements are coming, not so much from the Unionist community, but from the policing community? Its argument may be that some of the arrangements create difficulty for the type of professional police work it would want to do but for which it feels it could not account as well as it should on an ongoing basis regarding continuing operations. Is this the problem that is emerging or is it another problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="880" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is part of it, but the problem which must be resolved is that the Patten report stated that the membership of the police boards and the district police partnerships should be open to all on an equal basis, that there should be clear lines of demarcation between the NIO, the Secretary of State and the Security Minister, that investigations, examinations or reports should be clear and the police board should have power.</P>
      <P>If the independence, functions and powers of the police board are pulled out, the collective view of everybody on the Nationalist side &ndash; I have spoken to all the key players, political, religious and others &ndash; is that it will not work. I will not convince them that it will work because they have long experience of it not working over six or seven decades. The Patten report was clear on this point. It emphasised this and people signed up to it on that basis. Therefore, there must be clear lines of demarcation with regard to the local policing boards. Otherwise, and this would be the unhelpful end which we do not wish to consider, the Nationalist community will not participate. If Nationalist groups do not participate, the boards cannot operate effectively. We must return to the starting point on this issue. I do not hold that view with regard to all 44 or, as some say, 70 issues. However, this matter is fundamental and we must stick absolutely to the Patten report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach regarding the need to ensure there is transparency in these arrangements. Perhaps it would be helpful, in persuading those who are reluctant to accept these arrangements and who consider them politically motivated rather than motivated by the best interests of effective policing, if this jurisdiction were to consider the implications of introducing similar transparency with regard to the operations of the Garda Síochána. It is difficult for us to say that things should be done with regard to transparency of policing in one part of the island if we are unwilling or unable to do them here given that we do not even have a police authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree in light of a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme that the 1986 legislation in this State with regard to the appeals procedure for citizens in relation to the Garda Síochána needs to be revamped? As Deputy Bruton indicated, does the Taoiseach agree it would be a way of reassuring those in Northern Ireland who feel the professional levels of policing might be in some way undermined if that fear was to be contradicted by bringing forward the level of transparency and accountability outlined in the Patten report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In an interview after I read the Patten report, I stated there were many aspects of it which would be good practice in any jurisdiction and I have not changed my view on that. <Col N="881" /> There has been a move in recent years to involve people more. We must remember where some aspects of the Patten report came from. They came from people involved in international policing who looked at best practice in the United States and in parts of Europe, not to mention here. They did not come from a model adopted for Northern Ireland but from a model taken from where there is crime, racial tensions, poverty, deprivation and ethnic differences. They are not bad from that point of view.</P>
      <P>While I will try to resolve some of these issues tonight, the Secretary of State also published the implementation plan yesterday. It sets out how each of the Patten recommendations will be implemented. I have already said to the parties in the North today that it should be read and assessed in conjunction with the police Bill. It deals with the legislative changes required.</P>

In view of the growing perception that this project is being pushed by a golden circle which has an alternative agenda to that of the sporting federation and that it will be a costly white elephant which the taxpayer will have to fund, does he agree that there should be a moratorium on it so that a Dáil committee can investigate the costs involved? Will he comment on the vicious silent campaign by the Government and its agencies to undermine the Eircom Park project in west Dublin? </P>

      <P>A comprehensive feasibility study was carried out on the stadium and its cost is estimated at £281 million, although that does not include the aquatic centre which we are trying to facilitate for the 2003 Special Olympics. I estimate that will cost a further £20 million which will bring the total to £300 million. There may be ongoing costs associated with it but the relocation of the other services is a matter for the Department of Finance. The Deputy estimates that it will cost £500 million. I estimate that would be cheap for a national stadium.</P>

If we add that to £280 million and the £20 million the Minister mentioned, which is a conservative estimate for the 50 metre pool, the total is more than £400 million and we have not set one stone upon another. Will he consider a moratorium on this project until a Dáil committee with powers can investigate the implications of this infrastructural development which will cost the taxpayer a minimum of £500 million? </P>

      <P>There is not a requirement for any further quango to investigate the cost of the stadium. A comprehensive feasibility study has been carried out. The Government is also involved in decentralisation and it is estimated that up to 10,000 people may be required to relocate, which will cost money. Any further requests about the estimated cost of decentralising any section is a matter for the Department of Finance.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the labour shortage within the tourism industry is hindering development and quality of service; if his attention has been drawn to the fact of the diminishing pool of potential employees among the long-term unemployed; and the plans he has to promote work permits to non-EU nationals within the tourism industry.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16106/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the tourism industry, with a number of other sectors, is at present facing difficulties in recruiting staff due to the general tightening in the labour market. <Col N="885" /> I am particularly conscious that sustained labour shortages and high turnover of staff, unless addressed by the industry, could adversely affect the development of the sector and quality of service on offer. In 60% of hotels and 80% of restaurants there is no training programme in place. It is estimated that if the number of non-Irish employees increased to 25%, especially in the front of house area, from the current level of 10%, the céad míle fáilte could be at risk.</P>
      <P>In reply to a similar question from the Deputy last April, I referred to a report which was published by CERT last year, entitled &ldquo;Hospitality 2000&rdquo;, which quantified the expected skills requirements facing the industry up to the year 2005. This report highlighted the two major challenges facing the industry &ndash; the recruitment of new entrants and the retention and development of existing staff.</P>
      <P>CERT is continuing to work with industry partners to address the challenges set out in the report. Implementation of the recommendations will require the industry to commit additional resources to develop and retain valuable staff and to find ways to achieve excellence and improve productivity with the same or fewer staff.</P>
      <P>CERT is also continuing to develop new programmes to encourage people into the industry. Innovative pilot programmes have been launched targeting women wishing to return to paid employment and the long-term unemployed. Each programme has been designed to meet the particular needs of the participants.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>In the case of women interested in returning to paid employment, the programme is operated on a part-time basis to tie in with family responsibilities and it is envisaged that local hotels and restaurants will also offer flexible hours in a bid to attract such potential workers. I understand from CERT that the pilot programme initiated last year has been very successful and, as a result, it is being expanded throughout this year. CERT expects that up to 500 women will receive training in 15 centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Programmes for the long-term unemployed have been established by CERT in Ballymun, Clondalkin and Merchant's Quay &ndash; traditional unemployment black spots &ndash; in an effort to make it as easy as possible for people to avail of training and to enter the tourism industry subsequently. All of the projects have been developed in conjunction with local employers and area partnerships and it is expected that all participants will have job offers on completion of training. Over 50% of participants on these special programmes for the long-term unemployed are women. Feasibility studies are being conducted by CERT for the possible establishment of similar programmes in Sligo, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT has also increased its efforts to recruit people for its traditional courses for the unemployed but accept that potential recruitment in <Col N="886" /> this category is showing signs of decline due to the tightening labour market. To promote careers in the industry among this group, CERT launched a travelling &ldquo;roadshow&rdquo; specifically aimed at adults. An information unit, advertised through local radio and newspapers, visited 15 towns in November and December last year promoting information on elementary courses and conducting walk-in interviews. It is planned to repeat this exercise during this year.</P>
    <P>Under the new national development plan, my Department will continue to work closely with CERT to refine its activities in the future and to further develop the measures to be taken to help address the requirements of the industry in an increasingly competitive labour market.</P>
    <P>In a separate effort to boost recruitment levels, tourism employers have participated in recruitment fairs in Wales and Scotland which have proved very successful in attracting staff to Ireland. They are due to participate further in focused recruitment in England, France, Spain, Sweden, Finland and Greece. Irish participation in such fairs is co-ordinated by FÁS, which welcomes employer participation. The Irish Hotels Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual hotels are also participating in EURES, the European employment service, to help satisfy labour supply in the hospitality sector.</P>
    <P>While I have no specific plans to arrange for the promotion of work permits for non-EU nationals, a number of private sector recruitment agencies are actively engaged in recruiting workers from overseas for employment in the hospitality industry.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has indicated that her Department is prepared to issue work permits for the employment of non-European economic area nationals by Irish employers in the tourism industry where the employers can demonstrate that they have made every reasonable effort to recruit Irish or other EEA nationals for the positions concerned without success. There are also, of course, immigration and labour law requirements to be met in such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a crisis in the hotel industry? Will he consider increasing the level of training within the industry and offer a double tax free allowance to help employers hold on to staff? Does he agree that it is taking too long for visas to be granted? There is a pool of people in Europe who would be anxious to work in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>CERT has facilitated and encouraged the entire industry to conduct its own training. I mentioned that 60% of hotels and 80% of restaurants have no training programme. The State, through CERT, will continue to do all it can in the training area but the industry must also conduct its own training because the economy is doing well and more people are coming here. The two most important words in this area are recruit<Col N="887" /> ment and retention and the industry must realise that.</P>
      <P>There are problems but they are not confined to this sector. We are aware of them and will monitor them but the industry itself must realise the necessity of training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an incentive to employers? They cannot deal with the training element at present because they are under such pressure. Does the Minister agree that CERT, while it has done an outstanding job, is unable to grow at the same rate as the industry, which has accelerated at an unprecedented rate, with 45 hotels opening in the last 18 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years CERT has focused on the labour problem but the industry must also get on top of the labour shortage problem. A number of initiatives have been put in place by the State to incentivise the area so more people will enter the tourism and hospitality industry. These initiatives included the national tourism careers roadshow, school talks, exhibitions, guidance counselling, information brochures, application forms, advertising in national newspapers and on radio and television, courses for the unemployed and return to work programmes. There was a £1 million area based response scheme for the long-term unemployed. Those are all incentives to get people back into the workforce and to enter the tourism industry. It is not up to the State to offer any more incentives. If tourism is to continue growing at such a rate, the industry will have to put more into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the CERT element of training is confined to certain proprietors within the industry and that the new, emerging market cannot avail of CERT services because, in some areas, it is a closed club?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The last incentive set out to attract people, particularly women who had reared their children or who had previously worked in the voluntary sector, back into the workforce We opened 15 areas throughout the State, researched the needs of the industry in those areas and trained people in accordance with those needs. Those areas may not be fully aware of that work yet but the schemes are in operation and have been very successful in bringing people back into work.</P>

The implementation arrangements have still to be finalised in agreement with the European Commission.</P>

The concept of social inclusion is becoming increasingly more important, particularly given that many people are becoming marginalised and socially excluded.

The Department of Finance has advised us that it anticipates that approval will be issued by the EU Commission by the end of September or early October.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £4 million was originally made but we have only drawn down £3 million. As already stated, these moneys can be used up if necessary. I met representatives of a number of the partnerships last week and asked them to submit their programmes by the end of July.

      <Quest>if he will make a comprehensive statement on the up-to-date estimate of the cost of Sports Campus Ireland, with all knock-on costs included.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15924/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 24 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that, following the Government's decision in January last to proceed with the development of Campus and Stadium Ireland, a development company under the chairmanship of the former Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Paddy Teahon, was established. The company has the responsibility for taking the project through the design and construction stages.</P>
      <P>The first step in the development of Sports Campus Ireland will be a final decision on an aquatic centre to be ready for the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003. Following on from the original feasibility study, PricewaterhouseCoopers has been engaged to carry out a further feasibility study on Sports Campus Ireland and it is expected that the outcome of this study will be available in the near future. I understand the board of the development company will make a recommendation to the Government on this matter following consideration of the further feasibility study. The matter of a planning application for the stadium is one for the board of the development company and the appropriate planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assets of the campus and stadium will be vested in a board of trustees which will be appointed by the Government in the near future. The trustees will be given terms of reference which will include confirming that the development of Campus and Stadium Ireland is in line with guiding principles to be set by the Govern<Col N="891" /> ment. I appreciate that Deputies John Bruton and Quinn agreed to nominate representatives to the board of trustees.</P>
    <P>On the up-to-date estimate of the cost of Sports Campus Ireland, there has not been any change in the figure of £281 million set down by consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, in the original feasibility study published in January 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's treatment of the figures is somewhat bewildering. The original estimate of the cost of Sports Campus Ireland was £281 million, to which has been added a further £20 million in respect of the construction of a 50 metre pool at the aquatic centre. The consultants studied 15 projects in other countries while drawing up their feasibility study and they discovered that, on average, such projects overran by approximately 73.4%. Taking that and the average overrun percentage into account, Sports Campus Ireland will cost more than £500 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman:</NameTxt>
      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>We were recently informed that transfer of the State Laboratory from Abbotstown would cost £90 million. Is the Minister in a position to provide an overall figure &ndash; one which includes the cost of ancillary developments &ndash; for the cost of Sports Campus Ireland? Does he agree that the final cost will probably be in the region of £1 billion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, following completion of a comprehensive feasibility study, it was estimated that the construction of Sports Campus Ireland would cost £281 million. That remains the position. The Deputy should be aware that the French, the Welsh, the British, the Germans, the Australians and the Americans have also built stadia, the cost of which ranged from approximately £150 million to £300 million.</P>
      <P>A further feasibility study has been carried out in respect of the aquatic centre because we want to show the world that we will be able to run a comprehensive Special Olympic Games in 2003. For that reason, a special aquatic centre must be provided. With regard to the ancillary developments to which the Deputy referred, there will be an additional cost of approximately £20 million. We could stay here until the cows come home outlining different figures but the current estimated cost of the stadium is approximately £300 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>We could stay until the chickens come home to roost, rather than until the cows come home, because the chickens will come home to roost for the taxpayer. Is the Minister aware that in reply to Question No. 168 of 30 May, the Minister for Finance stated that the cost of relocating the Marine Institute and the State laboratories would be in the region of £90 million? That cost did not include the relocation cost of the <Col N="892" /> farm. In view of this, who exactly is running the show? The Minister is on record in the media as saying the show is being driven by the Taoiseach's Department but the Taoiseach refuses to answer questions and passes them on to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation who is burying his head in the sand and repeating the mantra of £280 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should put a question to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, for the sake of the taxpayers, to a moratorium being imposed on this lunatic project until such time as all aspects of the project have been examined by a Dáil committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated previously, matters that relate to decentralisation are the responsibility of the Department of Finance. All decentralisation incurs a cost, and Abbotstown will not be an exception. Some 500 acres of State-owned property have been designated for Stadium Ireland.</P>
      <P>Rather than being a lunatic project, the stadium will stand as a potent symbol of where Irish people are at at the beginning of the new millennium. We may not benefit greatly from the stadium but future generations of Irish people will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not comment on the section of the report which dealt with the survey on the 15 other stadia to which I referred. Does the Minister agree it is ironic that we have now learned of an added cost of £90 million in relation to the development of Sports Campus Ireland which will involve the relocation of Abbotstown, etc? That figure is approaching twice the amount being contributed by the private donor. This project is eating up money.</P>
      <P>On the 50 metre swimming pool which is to be ready in 2003 for the Special Olympics, will the Minister outline a timeframe within which planning permission will be sought for this project and can he give the House a categoric guarantee that the 50 metre pool will be ready in time for the Special Olympics? Obviously, we would all support him in regard to that project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the 15 other stadia and pointed out that the costs would overrun. I pointed out that the top price for the other stadia currently being built is £300 million. Of course development and construction costs are increasing, but I would argue that whatever its cost a national stadium will be an asset to this country for generations to come and should be supported by all Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 50 metre swimming pool, I cannot give the Deputy a categoric answer as to whether it will be ready by 2003, having regard to planning permission, etc. We are certainly aiming to have the pool completed by 2003 and I want to assure the Deputy and those involved in the Special <Col N="893" /> Olympics that if we encounter problems with planning permission, I have a plan B.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume plan B is to go down to Limerick where there will be a 50 metre pool. Does the Minister agree the difference between the 15 other stadia and our proposed stadium is that each of the 15 will have anchor tenants whereas the national stadium will not, unless the Eircom-FAI project is wrecked by other means or the Minister is aware of some other agenda? Does the Minister agree the proposed stadium will not have an anchor tenant and that it will be under-utilised and will not provide a return on the cost of between £500 million and £750 million? I am not exaggerating those figures because the Minister confirmed today that the minimum cost at this point will be between £400 million and £500 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always stated my belief that it would be in the international interest and in the interest of Irish soccer generally if the FAI was to come on board with us in Stadium Ireland. That offer stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should leave the FAI to do its own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Together, the FAI and the State could expedite the upgrading of our national soccer infrastructure. The upgrading of that infrastructure is paramount to getting people to return to soccer matches. Match attendance figures are the lifeblood of any association and we want to ensure families can return to soccer matches at affordable prices. There is something drastically wrong with Irish soccer. The National League final replay, for example, which was played in the middle of Monaghan, attracted 25,000 people whereas the FAI cup final replay in the middle of Dublin attracted only 6,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>What has that to do with anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must encourage people to return to soccer matches. If the FAI and the State worked together, we could improve our national infrastructure but, having said that, I acknowledge that the FAI is entitled to pursue a project with Eircom, and the Government will provide it with any assistance it requires.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>if guidelines exist setting out the frequency that local drugs task forces should meet having regard to the fact that a person (details supplied) nominated to one such task force in November 1999 has not yet been notified of a meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15909/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are no formal guidelines setting out the frequency of local drugs task <Col N="894" /> force meetings, the task force referred to in the Deputy's question meets, on average, every three weeks.</P>
      <P>The task force is located in the Dublin Corporation and, to a lesser extent, the South Dublin County Council electoral areas. In view of this, I understand the task force issued letters on 22 October 1999, inviting Dublin Corporation to nominate three councillors and inviting South Dublin County Council to nominate one councillor to participate in its work.</P>
      <P>On 30 May 2000, Dublin Corporation replied to this correspondence, forwarding details of its three nominees. I am informed that the task force is still awaiting a reply from South Dublin County Council and has issued a reminder, requesting it to forward its nomination at its earliest convenience. I have asked the National Drugs Strategy Team to make contact with the county council in order that what appears to have been an oversight can be sorted out as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the person who is the subject of this question and a former Member of this House has been treated very badly? I understand he was nominated last November and has still not attended a meeting of the task force. Does the Minister agree that the fact that local authorities are not responding to correspondence from the drugs task forces reflects on his overall stewardship? Does he agree delays such as this should not occur and that a proper monitoring system should be put in place to ensure this type of time lag does not occur in regard to an operation which is so vital to an enormous social problem in our society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>A handbook on the task forces was issued in which we urged public representatives to become involved in the task forces. The person in question is eminently suited to being a member of the task force. The local authorities in question received correspondence on this matter to which Dublin Corporation replied, nominating three people, but to which South Dublin County Council did not reply. I am not sure whether it is a mix up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and I do not believe that is acceptable but, in general, the task forces have done a fantastic job over the past number of years and I would not criticise them. They are under a great deal of pressure and some of the work is done on a voluntary basis. This issue will be resolved. There has been a problem with public representatives being on task forces, but everywhere I go I urge local drug task forces to engage local representatives and bring them on board. This case can be resolved. Obviously there is a breakdown in communications somewhere along the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, <Col N="895" /> Deputy Ryan, for his response. I take it that he will see to it that this matter is resolved quickly. It is equally important that he should carry out a study of what is happening to make sure that there are no similar situations. If there are similar situations, he should make sure that they are rectified immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Will the Minister of State give the House an undertaking that he will make sure that there is no such logjam regarding membership of these committees and that he will set about immediately establishing the situation and taking immediate and urgent action if there are other problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will. As I said, when I spoke to local drug task forces I urged them to include local public representatives. I must say, in fairness to the local drug task forces, that there has been a mixed response from many public representatives. I am not saying that this is the case here because, as I said, this person is eminently suitable for it, but some public representatives have not responded positively. However, I will check to see if there are other public representatives who sought membership of the task forces and for one reason or another have not been able to do so.</P>
      <P>All the projects in which the drug task forces are engaged are being assessed to see if we can mainstream them and move them along. The task forces are extremely busy. They are doing a great deal of work, as the Deputy will be aware. However, I will find out if there is a problem with other public representatives being unable to gain membership of local drug task forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated on a number of occasions, and most recently in reply to a Parliamentary Question No. 126 of 1 June 2000, responsibility for the dispute regarding the clothing to be worn by Irish track and field athletes competing in the Sydney Olympic Games rests squarely with the Olympic Council of Ireland and the Athletics Association of Ireland, and only they can resolve it. Contacts are being maintained with both organisations in an effort to bring about a resolution. I am hopeful that both organisations will, in the best interests of our athletes and Irish sport, agree a way forward.</P>
      <P>As no doubt Deputies will be aware, funding for the national governing bodies of sport and for the Olympic Council of Ireland is now solely the responsibility of the Irish Sports Council. Accordingly, the question of my withdrawing support from any such organisation does not arise.</P>
      <P>I understand that accreditation for attendance at the Olympic Games is usually arranged on location at the time of the games. As I have not yet decided whether to attend the Sydney games, the question of accreditation does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that reply. I reiterate my personal support for his efforts to bring this matter to a conclusion. I was utterly appalled to read in a national newspaper that the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland stated&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that unless the Minister changed his attitude and saw reason, he would not be accredited to attend the Olympics in Sydney. Does the Minister consider it appalling that a member of a sporting organisation, albeit the president, would threaten the Minister in charge of sport in the State? Has he taken any action regarding that insult to democratic politics and to this House which was delivered by the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland? Has the State arrived at the position where tin gods can insult and threaten Ministers with impunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's support and indeed all the Deputies' support on this issue but the answer is no. I did not respond to what was said at that time and I do not think really that it is worthy of a response.</P>
      <P>A degree of peace has broken out. I have always maintained that I tried to steer a line down the middle of this entire area and that is what I continue to try to do. I hope to get a resolution as soon as possible. However, I appreciate the Deputy's comments.</P>

    <Col N="897" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is hard to understand how two major organisations could enter into contractual agreements knowing full well that such agreements brought them into conflict at Atlanta in 1996? Would he again urge both organisations to reach some form of compromise in order that the good name of Irish sport and the well-being of the athletes who will represent Ireland abroad will not be tarnished again as it was in Atlanta?</P>
      <P>The threats made to the Minister were despicable. I would urge him to attend the Sydney games as Minister &ndash; he is still of course Minister. If the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland does not accredit the Minister, it could be done by the international Olympic movement in Switzerland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue will be addressed fully after the Olympic Games. That is my understanding from the correspondence my Department has received to date. Unfortunately, of the 200 countries attending the Olympics, Ireland is the only country in which the problem has not been resolved.</P>
      <P>It is a sensitive issue. We must appreciate that Adidas and Asics, the two corporate sponsors involved, have been a tremendous asset to sport in Ireland down through the years. They signed contracts in good faith with both of these organisations and we want them to continue to support Irish sport. It is a delicate issue. I have maintained contact with all the relevant bodies concerned, including the sponsors, and I hope we will get a resolution to this intractable issue in the near future. I appreciate the Deputies' assistance in this issue. They may rest assured that as soon as I have word of any breakthrough, I will let both of them know immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the threat delivered by the President of the Olympic Council was diabolical in terms of the example it gave to the young people of Ireland, either regarding sport or democratic institutions?</P>
      <P>As he stated in reply to Deputy Allen, the question of whether the Minister attends the Olympics is still an issue, but I would ask him to take account of that particular insult to this House, to democratic politics and to his office, as Minister, when it comes to considering whether that organisation will be entitled to funding in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Olympic Games will the Minister speak with the individual federations which make up the Olympic movement because this has been a cancer in sport for some time? As somebody who addressed the funding issue <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Olympic Council of Ireland and suffered <Col N="898" /> because of it by different means, I ask him to look, in conjunction with the Irish Sports Council, at the future funding of the Olympic Council of Ireland once the Olympic Games are over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Both questions concern the funding issue. I will not do anything which would disrupt the Sydney Olympic Games for the athletes or make any decisions on funding at this point. As I said, it is also a matter for the Irish Sports Council. The problem will be resolved in the aftermath of the games. The problem arises on this occasion from the failure to bring the two sides together to agree on a policy. The individual federations that make up the Olympic movement have always been funded by the State and will continue to be. The matter will be resolved after the Olympic Games and I see no reason it could not be resolved at this point.</P>
      <P>I have received a letter from the Olympic Council of Ireland which states that the Olympic charter, during the Sydney games, is copperfastened and the national Olympic committee has sole authority to determine uniforms and clothing at all times during these games, including all sports competitions and ceremonies related thereto. It is just a matter of confirming, &ldquo;Yes, we are right&rdquo;. I stress that the information in this letter came from the OCI. The AAI insists that the IAAF has the right to choose the gear. I have had no response to my correspondence with the IAAF so I must assume that organisation is in agreement. However, I appreciate the ongoing support of Deputies. A certain level of peace surrounds the issue at this time and following contacts with all the parties involved, I hope we will have a resolution soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the case. Contacts have been made with all the participants, with both organisations, sponsors and others involved. It is hoped a resolution will be forthcoming but at present I do not know what gear will be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The review of the national drugs strategy as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has commenced. The object of the review is to identify gaps or deficiencies in the existing strategy, develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new arrangements through which to deliver them. The review will identify the latest available data on the extent and nature of problem drug use in the country as a whole, emerging trends in drug use and the <Col N="899" /> areas with the greatest level of problem drug use. It will also examine international trends, developments and best practice models.</P>
      <P>Advertisements inviting submissions from individuals and groups were placed in national Sunday and daily newspapers and in local papers in the major urban areas in mid-April. Responses were requested by 26 May. However, on foot of special requests from various groups, I agreed to extend the closing date for receipt of submission to 6 June of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have arranged for eight public consultative fora to be held during June, in Dublin, where there will be two, Athlone, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Kilkenny. These fora were also advertised in the national and local press. The first of these fora will be held in Cork on Friday of this week.</P>
      <P>The review will also have available to it an evaluation of the drugs initiative by independent consultants including the results of individual evaluations of local drugs task force projects currently under way. These evaluations, together with other local, national and international materials, will be reviewed and findings incorporated in the final report.</P>

I refer to section C of the list of promised legislation in which 18 Bills are promised, with three on the current list. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is floundering at a time when people are being beaten up and killed in their homes.

      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has brought forward much more legislation than any other Department. It has had an enormous amount of Bills in every session. It endeavours as best it can to give high priority to necessary legislation. Most of the legislation which arose from the Good Friday Agreement was its responsibility. All the human rights legislation was its responsibility while, at the same time, it had to deal with a criminal justice Bill and the drug courts legislation. All this legislation has been brought forward along with the two major pieces of equality legislation. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has delivered an enormous amount of legislation. That is not to say that a huge amount of legis<Col N="903" /> lation does not remain to be dealt with, but it is unfair to say the Department has not delivered the legislative programme it has been asked to do.</P>

      <P>I alerted the Taoiseach last week to promised legislation on appeals for children with special needs, relating to under provision for their needs. It was promised by the out-<Col N="906" /> going Minister on 21 January and does not seem to appear on the legislative programme. Did the Taoiseach have a chance to check whether that was an oversight and whether legislation is being prepared, because the current legislation explicitly prevents any such appeal mechanism?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is mistaken. On a point of clarification, the Education Act explicitly prevented parents of children with special needs from raising an appeal on the services with which they are provided. The out-going Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, promised on 21 January that such an appeal mechanism would be introduced. It does not appear on the legislation programme. There needs to be legislation for this matter. Perhaps the Taoiseach's colleague, who is beside him, will clarify that legislation is in preparation and that it will in future appear on the Government programme.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> We felt strongly about the additional punitive and excessive powers being given to the Garda and customs officials to arrest somebody without any notice or warrant, on the basis even of a suspicion. Deputy Howlin read correspondence he had received from the Irish Refugee Council in which it strongly objected to providing these unqualified powers. The council has hands-on involvement in this area and considerable expertise and knowledge of the sensitivities and sensibilities involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then those of us who have an interest in this area have received representations from other interest groups which have come forward with similar views. For example, Amnesty International, which is an independent body with qualified international expertise in this area, has contacted all of us and has expressed in the strongest terms its objection to the new powers of detention. It believes the new powers contravene the principles of international law. Amnesty <Col N="910" /> International issued a press statement in which it stated:</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced amendments to the Immigration Act, 1997, that aim to strengthen the powers of Gardaí and immigration officers to detain unsuccessful asylum seekers. The proposed provisions contain no safeguards. The lack of safeguards is particularly shocking given that (a) unsuccessful seekers are not criminals [we made that point repeatedly during last week's debate. These people threw themselves at the mercy of the State, Government and people and have been rejected but they are not common criminals] and (b) detention may be imposed on the basis of a suspicion of future conduct, not on the basis of certainty.</P>
    <P>Under the amendments, Gardaí and immigration officers may arrest without warrant and detain an unsuccessful asylum seeker who has been issued with a deportation order. The proposed provisions confer unlimited powers to detain, and directly contravene Ireland's obligations under international law.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International calls for the appropriate safeguards to be put in place. Detention should only be imposed where it is absolutely necessary, for a minimal period, and should be subject to close judicial supervision [there is no such supervision in Ireland. An individual can be picked up following a knock on the door Gestapo-like, taken at the dead hour of night to a place of detention, kept there for several weeks and eventually deported]. Detention should never be arbitrarily imposed. The detained person should be informed of the reasons for his or her detention, in a language that he or she understands, and should be offered an opportunity to appeal the decision. At that stage currently there is no appeals process. Rejected asylum seekers should not be held with remand prisoners . . .</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin and I sought to obtain a clear, categorical assurance from the Minister, as Amnesty International seeks, that these unfortunate people should not be held with remand prisoners or convicted criminals. They are not criminals and many are economic migrants who have no option but to throw themselves at the mercy of the asylum application centre in Lower Mount Street, Dublin, and others because there is not a proper immigration channel in the State. We sought clarification from the Minister regarding where these people will be kept. What type of prison regime will be put in place?</P>
    <P>Amnesty International concludes by stating:</P>
    <P>Women with children, unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable categories of people should not be detained. Detention should never be used as a signal to deter would-be asylum-seekers as this would be contrary to the principles of international protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> That obviously is the intention of this provision which was lumped into the Bill at this late stage. This has been the obvious intention of quite a number of the Minister's announcements. The clear message to be sent out to the international community and the Third World, in particular, is that Ireland, if it is not a no-go area for asylum seekers, should not be a first choice in making an application. As I have stated on successive occasions in the House, if the Dublin Convention, which Ireland hosted and to which it is a party, was properly operated in concert with other member states, there would not be any need for this measure or the hysteria at Government level in regard to the issue of asylum and refugees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. It is a little difficult to sustain an argument on the issues when a new Minister takes the same Bill because in a way the argument has to be made afresh. The Minister of State, no doubt, has had an opportunity to read the debate so far but I hope she has come with an open mind to accept a convincing argument where she hears it and make amendments. My experience is that often Ministers of State, in particular, come into the House to take sections of Bills when the senior Minister is unavoidably absent, with instructions to concede nothing and give no quarter, no matter what case is made. This measure is extremely important and impinges on civil liberties and human rights. It should be analysed thoroughly and an open approach should be taken to arguments from any side of the House. I sincerely hope the Minister of State approaches the debate with openness. Her record attests to her fairness in previous debates of this nature.</P>
      <P>In essence we are debating the kernel of the new sections of the legislation. I fundamentally disagree with the manner in which the Government is pursuing this measure and I want it understood whenever these proceedings are read, broadcast or revisited that it is wrong that laws are made in such a manner. The amendments were tabled one day before Report Stage following a lengthy Second Stage debate, submissions from interested parties to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and Committee Stage had been debated in full. It is wrong at such a late stage for the Government to introduce absolutely new matter, yet that is what happened. An order of the House was required to recommit these amendments on Committee Stage because they comprised new matter. That is a bad way to make any law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandable in times of emergency there might be some reasoning behind it, but this legislation is approaching its first anniversary. It was introduced as urgent legislation to deal with the issue of trafficking<i> simpliciter</i> and then it was discovered to be a useful vehicle to shore up the shambles in immigration and asylum policy that was identified by the discerning Minister of State <Col N="912" /> at the Department of Foreign Affairs. The policy remains a shambles. We are still grafting on bits and bobs. I described the legislation on the last occasion as a bad patchwork quilt. This is the worst way to make law because we are debating the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, but the amendment before us amends the Immigration Bill, 1999, which was an expandable vehicle to amend both the Refugee Act and the Aliens Act, 1935. It is a measure used to amend a measure that was itself used to amend a measure. It requires consolidation and a Government that knows and sets out its policy.</P>
    <P>Almost a year ago I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business what was Government policy on immigration. He responded that there was such a thing and that it would be communicated to me. Some time later I received a letter from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform saying he had been asked by the Taoiseach to forward it to me. I am still waiting. I have asked numerous times when the consolidating immigration Bill will be before the House. The most recent response from the Taoiseach was that it will be next year. That is not good enough. We cannot deal with this critical issue in this haphazard, slapdash way.</P>
    <P>The net issues before us are of critical importance. In the short time at my disposal I have sought to amend this new raft of amendments by tabling four amendments to amendment No. 25 in the name of the Minister. For the benefit of the Minister of State I refer to the import of these amendments. I hope she will give them a fair hearing. Amendment No. 25 proposes to amend the Immigration Act, 1999, by inserting a series of new sections. The principle is set out in the proposed insertion of subsection (1A), which I seek to delete by amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 25 in my name. The purpose of the proposed new subsection (1A) is to provide that &ldquo;a person the subject of a deportation order under this section may be detained in accordance with the provisions of this Act for the purpose of ensuring his or her deportation from the State&rdquo;. A power is to be given to the Garda Síochána and to immigration officers acting in the name of the State to detain anybody the subject of a deportation order. The forming of a view that the person will not comply with the terms of the deportation order is sufficient to put somebody into custody.</P>
    <P>We cherish liberty probably above all else. The statistics of those imprisoned in the country over the last number of years indicate that, thankfully, we do not have a general policy of imprisoning large numbers of people. Normally we do that as a last resort, although this gun-ho Administration of zero tolerance seeks to present a huge development in the number of prison places as a glorious achievement rather than a development that is far from welcome. With that background and understanding we should encroach on people's liberty, whether they are citizens or not, with the greatest of care, to give a blanket authority to serve a <Col N="913" /> deportation notice and put somebody into custody at the same time tramples too far. I hope the Minister of State will reflect on that. I also hope she will not read out verbatim every paper she is handed and that she will listen to an argument that says this is an unnecessary power which should not be granted.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 25 seeks to insert a time limit for the new power to detain if there is to be a detention. The Minister indicated that the maximum aggregate time of eight weeks, which is already enshrined in the Immigration Act, would apply to this provision. I do not know your views on this, Sir, but I would have a very fearful regard for the prospect of being imprisoned, detained or incarcerated, yet that is the prospect facing any unsuccessful asylum seeker. As Deputy Jim Higgins rightly said, these are not criminals. They could be women and children. They have committed no criminal act. They have been determined not to qualify for asylum in this country as provided for by the law. However, the Minister wishes to ensure that people who fall into that category &ndash; women, children and men &ndash; can be detained for up to eight weeks.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked where are these people to be detained. The Minister could not give me a direct answer. I hope there has been some reflection in the Department and the Minister of State can answer me now. It is proposed to give these extra powers, so the matter must have been thought out. Are the people to be detained in local Garda stations, in the national remand prison which, after the catalogue of errors involved in its building and fitting out, is finally open, although I am not sure if it is functioning to its optimum? Will it be somewhere else, for example, a disused Army barracks? Where are these men, women and children to be detained until they are forcibly ejected from the State? We must have a response to that question before this section is concluded. It is not good enough to say that the Minister has not thought it out, that there might be various options open or that it will be thought out in due course. If the Minister is seeking these powers he must know how they are to be implemented. The House has a right to know before the matter is tested by a vote.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 in my name to amendment No. 25 seeks to delete some new parts of amendment No. 25. These include the powers given in the section to the Garda to add new conditions that are required to be implemented by the potential deportee. Amendment No. 25 will give a power of arrest if a garda has reasonable cause to suspect that the person he wants to deport intends to leave the State and enter another state without lawful authority. If a non-national arrives in my constituency &ndash; as many hundreds are doing on the Rosslare boat &ndash; applies for asylum but has his application turned down after due process and seeks to leave the country, he would be arrested under the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister is taking his obligations <Col N="914" /> under the common travel area very seriously. Perhaps he would do the same in the context of the French boat, which does not deal with the common travel area. From the best information I have from the most authoritative sources &ndash; asylum seekers themselves &ndash; the French are anything but thorough in their policing of their side of the border, that is, the embarkation ports in France.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the Minister's response to my amendments to amendment No. 25. I do not wish to rehearse all my arguments, nor the views of the Irish Refugee Council, nor our obligations under international law or the European Convention of Human Rights. However, I hope the Minister of State paid attention to the arguments made on the last occasion. This is bad law and parachuting in a serious amendment in terms of its impact at the last moment is an extremely bad way to make law.</P>
    <P>The whole process of the making of law within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this area is fundamentally flawed because there is no comprehensive, well thought out policy that can be presented even in a non-legal form as a policy statement in a White Paper that sets out what the Department intends to put in place in terms of legislation. It is being made up as we go along. Flotels float one week and sink the next. Hotels are bought with great alacrity and this causes huge frustration because of a lack of proper consultation in many instances in preparing communities to take on the responsibility involved. Promises are made in relation to education and preparing society for the multi-cultural changes that are happening, but a derisory sum of money has been spent under the true colours initiative.</P>
    <P>There is no coherent policy and there is much bluster from a Minister from whom we are used to hearing bluster. I will have an opportunity during the Adjournment debate later to discuss matters on the criminal side where the Minister for zero tolerance is now presiding over an unprecedented wave of serious crime. He needs to get his act together, but the seeds he is sowing in this area will have implications for a generation, if not more. We can redress his failures with regard to criminal law when the Government changes but we will have great difficulty putting right his failures in this area of policy. For these reasons, I hope the Minister will think again. There is a different Minister present today and I am guardedly optimistic that a refreshing, new view will be displayed when she responds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> One hopes the Minister of State will have an open mind with regard to the arguments made last week and that will be made today. Hope springs eternal but, unfortunately, judging by the track record of the Government to date on the issue of asylum seekers, we cannot be too hopeful. However, the Minister of State must answer a number of the crucial arguments that have been made in <Col N="915" /> relation to the Bill. Undoubtedly, the legislation and the amendments proposed by the Minister seriously prejudice the rights of people seeking asylum in Ireland. It is also an extremely dishonest way to approach the question of dealing with asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>A Bill which was introduced to supposedly deal with gangsters who traffic in humans is one thing but to try to cobble onto it and insert into it severe and draconian measures, aimed at the victims of those traffickers, can only be interpreted as seriously prejudicing the rights of innocent and vulnerable people who seek asylum in Ireland. The reason the Government is taking this particular line of inserting these measures into the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill instead of making amendments to the Refugee Act will be outlined more clearly when we deal with the attack on the right to judicial review involved in amendments to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The powers given to the Garda to detain on a whim people who have orders against them cannot be described as anything other than draconian. It is repugnant to any concept of human rights and democracy. Aside from this extra draconian legislation, there are already examples of innocent people who have been treated disgracefully in that way. For example, the Costinas family from west Dublin were taken without warning in a dawn raid and incarcerated in the Bridewell in an attempt to deport them. The family had been living in Ireland for five years and the children were in local schools, sitting examinations. They were integrated into the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not satisfied with the powers he has already. He now wants to give the Garda the right to detain, on the slightest whim and without any warning, people who may be in the process of fighting an order for deportation against them. One can only guess what this will mean in psychological terms for people who are innocent of any crime. For example, any time a member of a family living in Ireland goes to the local Garda station to respond to a request under the legislation, if it is passed, one can imagine that the family will be on tenterhooks, wondering if their loved one will return or if he or she will be detained on the spot on the whim of a garda because there is a suspicion that the person may be in breach of one of the many conditions laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue which arises as a result of the new powers that will be given to the Garda is the dealings of the Minister with governments in countries from which asylum seekers come. The Minister of State must tell the House, before there is a division, what dealings the Government has had with the Nigerian Government in particular in regard to nationals from Nigeria who are seeking refuge in Ireland. The Minister took exception when I suggested that perhaps police from Nigeria would be stationed in Ireland in the same way as officers from Romania will come to this country. The Minister obviously took excep<Col N="916" /> tion because Nigeria, as will be clearly exposed, has endemic corruption at many levels of its bureaucracy in terms of its Government, police and army.</P>
    <P>It would be intolerable if police from that jurisdiction were brought to Ireland to deal with people who are seeking to escape from the heavy handed tactics in many cases of that police force. If police from Nigeria are not to be brought to Ireland, what arrangements is the Government proposing to put in place with the Nigerian Government with regard to the attempted removal of people from Nigeria who are seeking asylum or refuge in Ireland? In what level and precise forms of collusion will the Government be involved with the discredited government in Nigeria?</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that he intends to set up a special unit of the Garda, involving 37 members of the force to, in effect, chase down people whose asylum applications have been turned down in order to deport them. Does this mean in practice that the duty of a special unit of the Garda will be to comb every location where people whose asylum applications have been refused might be likely to be found? Does this mean that areas the immigrant community frequent, such as cafés, restaurants, etc., homes and workplaces are liable to be subjected to raids? Is that the road the Government is taking? That will be intolerable to the vast majority of people. I do not buy what appears occasionally in the media that this is a racist country, etc. The majority of our people will be appalled and repelled by this.</P>
    <P>The Minister corrected me the last day on the number of asylum seekers and revised it downwards from a figure I had been using. He said there are only 12,000 asylum seekers which is the same as the number of heroin addicts. Instead of the gardaí being sent to chase the gangsters who use heroin to destroy communities and thousands of young people, the Minister intends to send an entire unit to chase people whose only crime is to want a better life and who are prepared to work to make a contribution to this country and whose services and labour are being sought by many enterprises and employers. It is intolerable. To attempt to do that under the guise of this Bill is dishonest in the extreme and is seriously prejudicial to the rights of people who have not committed a crime, who are innocent and are seeking refuge in this country. In view of the arguments made, I hope the Government will change its tack at this late stage.</P>

      <P>I record my opposition to amendment No. 25 in the name of the Minister and to the way this legislation has been handled. Amendments to the Immigration Act, 1999, were brought in at the last minute and grafted on to this Bill in violation of fair procedure. Even those Deputies and parties whose resources are greater than mine had difficulty coping with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During last week's debate the Minister challenged another Deputy to enumerate the rights <Col N="917" /> of unsuccessful asylum seekers. I do not know what was behind that question but I know the answer &ndash; they have human rights. The commentary of the Minister and others shows a harsh and dismissive attitude to unsuccessful applicants, which is dangerous. There is a false suggestion that unsuccessful applicants are criminals. The Minister and others have repeatedly referred to unsuccessful applicants or to those not entitled to asylum under present rules as &ldquo;abusing the asylum system&rdquo;. This is also a dangerous fallacy. If a person is entitled to apply, how can they be justly accused of abusing the system? Such descriptions of people who come to this country do nothing to inform the ignorant and the prejudiced. On the contrary, they feed prejudice.</P>
    <P>The Minister, through his amendments, is scrupulous in ensuring the deportation process is as swift as possible. There is a need for powers of deportation. However, the Irish Refugee Council has stated that the Minister's proposed changes to the Immigration Act, 1999, represent &ldquo;a stringent tightening of the rights of unsuccessful asylum seekers to access legal remedies in the Irish courts&rdquo;. When I place these Government amendments in the context of the other legislation introduced by the Minister, I can only repeat what I said on Second Stage in December. Instead of coherent policy and practice on the separate but closely related issues of asylum and immigration, we have a patchwork of reactive legislation.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that the Government has welcomed police from the repressive regime in Nigeria to become involved in the asylum process. This turns the notion of asylum on its head. It is like inviting the Gestapo to assist in identifying Jews or the British army to identify republicans. Yet in this context we are asked to further tighten the deportation procedure. I cannot support that.</P>
    <P>I reject the Government's approach as embodied in amendment No. 25 and call again for fair asylum procedure, for the right to work and study for asylum seekers and for proper immigration legislation which will allow economic migrants, in numbers to be determined, to work in our country and to help meet the labour needs of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins stated that Amnesty International claimed that the Minister's proposals on detention under the deportation process are not compatible with international human rights law. The Minister pointed out that Article 5.1.f of the European Convention on Human Rights specifically contemplates the detention of those in relation to whom deportation is in process. There are already in section 5 of the Immigration Act specific provisions relating to the non-detention of minors and the power of the courts to release a person where the validity of a deportation order is challenged. The Minister has developed his proposals in close consultation with the Attorney General's office. That office has advised that <Col N="918" /> these proposals are fully in line with our international obligations and do not offend any principles of international law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins also claimed there is no normal immigration channel for those seeking to make their living in the State. That is patently untrue because it is obvious that a number of Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Malaysian, American, Canadians and other non-nationals have been living, working and running businesses here for many years. He also claimed that because of that theory people are forced to apply for asylum. No one is being forced to make false claims that they have been prosecuted in their own country. Anyone who makes such false claims is not only not deserving of the protection of this State but is deliberately and deceitfully, for his or her own selfish interests, damaging the position of those in need of the protection of the State. However, they cannot get it because of the number of claims which must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The powers of arrest and detention in the amendment are not unqualified nor are they without notice. They cannot be exercised except where the garda or the immigration officer with reasonable cause suspects that the deportee, who no longer has a right to be in the State, is in one of the categories specified at paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>) of the proposed section 5(1), the appeals process has already been undergone and they have failed.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Howlin, the State owes it to its fellow member states to ensure that where it has determined that a person should be returned to his or her own country of origin, where it is a failed asylum seeker or a convicted drug dealer who is being deported, the deportee should not be allowed to abuse the hospitality of yet another member state. That is why the Deputy's amendment is opposed. Deputy Howlin asked if he would be arrested while getting back on the boat. The answer is yes. Otherwise he would go back to England or France and return on the next boat. We would be presiding over a merry-go-round of illegal immigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be arrested and sent back. I know the Deputy is concerned about that but he should not be as it is right to do that.</P>
      <P>Deputies Howlin and Higgins were concerned about where people would be detained and so on. As is clear from the Act and the amendment, detention is for the purpose of ensuring the deportation of the person from the State. It is not the intention that they will lie in prison for weeks or months but, for the most part, for no longer than it takes to provide for their transport out of the State. In some cases it will be only for a few hours while transport is being arranged. In such cases this can be quite properly carried out by holding the person in a Garda station. In other longer term cases, people may have to be detained in prison or other places of detention but, in the majority of cases, if it is a question of arranging the next boat from Rosslare or flight from Dublin that should not take longer than a few hours and there should not be any need to send a person on from the Garda station to a place of detention.</P>
      <P>Many of the points raised today were also raised with the Minister who replied to them. I hope those points of clarification deal with Deputy Higgins' concern on the international front and in regard to detention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister did not give a more comprehensive response to the arguments. It is obvious that the attitude is one of continuing on from where we left off on the last occasion, not an inch. We have progressed somewhat in that the Minister of State has admitted that prison is a possible place of detention. She referred to the non-detention of minors in the immigration Act. Is it the intention to separate children from their families? If people are detained in a Garda station or a prison are the adults to be held in custody and the children put in the care of the health board? How is it to be dealt with? The argument put forward by the Minister of State that false claims add to the burden of genuine asylum seekers having their rights vindicated is analogous to saying that it is the fault of the sick that there are long waiting lists for treatment, that if there were fewer people seeking treatment those who were most meritorious would be prioritised. It is a false claim and one that does not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have experience of talking to a great number of asylum seekers because of the position in my constituency. I do not know if that is shared by the Minister of State. No immigrant is here <Col N="920" /> because of the craic or because it is exciting or for the hell of it. Nobody uproots themselves, and in some cases their children, from their homeland, in many instances travelling across more than one continent stowed away in vehicles, in some instances sealed in, in dangerous conditions and enduring sea-crossings without a very real reason. If at the end of the day that reason does not measure up to the legal criteria laid down by this Administration, it does not mean the people are criminals or clogging up the system and somehow meritorious of scorn or condemnation. I reject that view that underscores much of the Minister's argument.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if there is much point in labouring this issue any further as we had a long argument about it. I hoped the arrival of the Minister of State might have meant a change in attitude. Perhaps we should now let the House decide the matter.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister did not respond to an important point I raised. If the Government brings in legislation to fast-track out of the country people to whom it has not given <Col N="921" /> refuge, it will be responsibile for what happens to them. Deputy O'Malley stated here a year or so ago that he had no doubt that people who sought asylum at Shannon Airport and were bundled back onto airplanes probably met their death in the country from which they were trying to flee. I want the Minister of State to say what responsibility this Government will take for the safety of people whom her Government will deport to countries many of which do not respect human rights and where the safety, security and freedom of those people will be at risk. If the Minister of State is asking the Dáil to give her greater powers to enable her to send people back to such countries she must state that. What is the nature of the agreement either entered into or being sought by this Government with the Government of Nigeria? We know about Romania. With what other Governments in Eastern Europe, Africa or wherever is the Government seeking to enter into agreements regarding the deportation of nationals from those countries? The Minister of State must give that information. It will be an important factor in helping Deputies to decide how to vote on this matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Minister of State said I queried the legality of detention. Deputy Howlin and I have both accepted that in certain instances, deportation has to be an option. Amnesty International stated, &ldquo;Detention should only be imposed where it is absolutely necessary, for a minimal period, and should be subject to close judicial supervision.&rdquo;. That is what we are saying. We agree wholeheartedly with the view of Amnesty International. This is where doubts arise &ndash; how will detention be operated?</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is right in his assertion that 90% of asylum seekers are bogus, and if the figure is 12,000, we are talking about mass deportations. If procedures are speeded up we are on the brink of mass deportations, with between 10,000 and 12,000 people to be deported.</P>
      <P>It is also obvious that it is the intention of the Government to deport people within the shortest period possible. If the clear intention of the Government is to deport anyone who is not entitled to refugee status at the earliest opportunity, mass detention will be required. Mass deportation will mean keeping people in State custody of some form until such time as they are deported, for the period within which the deportation order is issued. We are entitled to a clear answer to this question. What kind of provision has been put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government did not walk into this blindly, we are talking about deporting 10,000 people. The clear intention is that the vast majority of these people will be detained until such time as the deportation orders can be effected and executed. What kind of accommodation will there be? Are we talking about accommodation in secure prisons such as Mountjoy, Limerick, Cork or Portlaoise? Are we talking about Cloverhill or <Col N="922" /> Wheatfield? Are we talking about accommodation in more open regimes such as Castlerea, which is still secure but has a different ethos? Are we talking about open accommodation such as Shelton Abbey? I presume not, because there will be a fear that these people will escape from custody and again seek to dishonour the terms of their deportation order.</P>
    <P>These are serious questions because, if the Minister is serious about the Bill, the intention is to deport and detain until deportation can take place. Will we detain these people in Garda stations? That would not be very practical.</P>
    <P>Doing this might seem popular now, but public opinion will swing in the opposite direction when people are being dragged across the tarmac and forcibly deported. Public opinion has not been properly tested on this issue &ndash; we are listening to the vocal minority. As soon as this happens, there will be a public outcry because the vast majority of people will not tolerate it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the waiting list analogy, or whatever analogy Deputy Howlin made, the point is still the same. We are talking about people seeking asylum who are not genuine asylum seekers.

      <P>That is the problem, this has been debated <i>ad infinitum</i>, the same questions are being asked again and the Deputies are on a merry-go-round. That is what is wrong, they cannot remember what they said.</P>
      <P>The same goes for the points made about Nigeria, Poland and the re-admission agreements. All of these points were answered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Perhaps the Deputies are getting us mixed up but all of the questions were answered last week. I will try to be helpful by referring them to section 5(1) of the Refugee Act, 1996 which states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
      <P>That might be of assistance in allaying the concerns of Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Howlin's concerns about children, I refer him to section 5(4)(<i>c</i>) of the Immigration Act, 1999, which states:</P>
      <P>Where an unmarried child under the age of 18 years is in the custody of any person (whether a parent or a person acting in loco parentis or any other person) and such person is detained pursuant to the provisions of this section, the immigration officer or the member of the Garda Síochána concerned shall, without delay, notify the health board for the area in which the person is being detained of the detention and of the circumstances thereof.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill, people who are detained will be separated from their families. Children will be taken into care because their parents will be placed in custody, either in prison or in a Garda station, as determined by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under this legislation. They will be detained under the Immigration Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Bill amends that legislation. I understand that the Minister of State is experiencing difficulty in keeping abreast of the debate. Amendment No. 25, although it is being tabled in respect of this Bill, is designed to amend the Immigration Act, 1999, and it is that Act we are discussing in respect of this group of amendments. The Immigration Act is bad legislation and the Government dealt with the debate on it in the same way as it is dealing with this debate. I refer here to the introduction of late amend<Col N="926" /> ments. I thought the Government would have learned that this is a bad way to make law.</P>
      <P>The amendments under discussion will, if accepted, cause difficulties for the Garda Síochána. They will hamper the administration of the system and there will be a public outcry when they are implemented. The Minister of State appears to be confused. In the first instance she informed me that a person who is the subject of a deportation order and who wants to board a boat leaving Rosslare will be arrested. However, she then stated that they would only be detained for a matter of hours because they would be put aboard the next boat leaving Rosslare. Vessels leaving Rosslare only sail to EU countries, they do not sail to Romania, Nigeria, Poland or Russia.</P>
      <P>Deporting people will not simply be a matter of bundling them on to the nearest boat, it will be a matter of putting them on an aeroplane. There are no direct flights to Nigeria from this country and there is only one weekly flight to Romania. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated that, under our corpus of law, a large proportion of the 12,000 asylum seekers and refugees will not qualify to remain here. Therefore, a large number of planes will be required to transport them elsewhere. Unless the Minister intends to charter those planes, people will be placed in detention for protracted periods. I am alerting the House to that because I believe such behaviour will be resisted by the Irish people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 11, after &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than a presumptive refugee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the various definitions on interpretation in the section. Section 1 states that an illegal immigrant &ldquo;means a non-national who enters or seeks to enter or has entered the State unlawfully&rdquo; and my amendment seeks to introduce an internationally accepted term to that section. I seek to amend the Bill by inserting, after &ldquo;non-national&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;other than a presumptive refugee&rdquo;. In other words, an illegal immigrant would mean a non-national other than a presumptive refugee who enters or seeks to enter or has entered the State unlawfully.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;presumptive refugee&rdquo; is an internationally accepted term and not one coined by me. It is a suggestion which has come from Amnesty International and it figures in the legislation of other countries. It is based on the fact that if a person makes an application here for asylum status, in other words, to be classified as a refugee, once he or she makes the application there are three possibilities. It can be accepted if it comes within the terms of the Geneva Convention, 1951, and domestic legislation which gives effect to that, it can be rejected on the basis that it is not properly founded and therefore does not come within the terms of the Geneva Convention or domestic legislation, or the Minister can decide on compassionate grounds to give a person permission to remain. We are seeking to amend the Bill so that the person will be a &ldquo;presumptive refugee&rdquo; until such time as that decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person applies here, not only should he or she be entitled to have his or her application duly heard and go through the different processes of the initial application &ndash; to have it vetted, to have it heard subsequently at appeal stage and to have a judicial review even though the Bill severely curtails the right to judicial review in terms of the time allowed for same &ndash; but according to the amendment the person should be classified as a &ldquo;presumptive refugee&rdquo; without in any way prejudicing the right of the Department to make its <Col N="930" /> decision to either accept or reject the application. Once the person makes the application, he or she is entitled to have the application processed. In addition, the person is entitled to the protection of <i>non-refoulement</i>, that he or she cannot be sent back to the country from whence he or she came as long as there is even a possibility that the person might be subjected to torture in its various guises.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, table the same amendment I tabled on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, in the light of what Deputy Howlin unsuccessfully implored her to do regarding the previous amendments on Committee Stage, to use her discretion on this occasion and to show the same degree of tolerance, good sense and flexibility as she showed when she came in to bat for the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the Committee and Report Stages of the Immigration Bill, 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as an extremely important issue and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, will reflect genuinely on what is intended here. This new section inserted by the Minister on Committee Stage makes it an offence for an individual to assist a person to do something which is lawful. I do not know of any precedent in law which says that someone who assists another to do something which is lawful can be guilty of an offence which carries a huge penalty of up to ten years in prison.</P>
      <P>The section says a person who &ldquo;organises or knowlingly facilitates the entry into the State of a person whom he or she knows, or has reasonable grounds to believe, to be an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to seek asylum shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;. If one knowlingly helps a person into the State who intends to seek asylum one will be guilty of an offence. That is wrong, <i>simpliciter.</i> The amendment I propose would insert after &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; the words &ldquo;otherwise than in a lawful and <i>bona fide </i>manner&rdquo;. The object of the amendment is to ensure that if someone is a genuine asylum seeker and turns out to be a genuine refugee and is given that status, the people who assisted him into the State would not be guilty of an offence. It would be unprecedented to make it unlawful &ndash; with a serious criminal penalty &ndash; to assist someone in doing something which is itself lawful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rejected this amendment on Committee Stage and that rejection casts doubt on the Bill as a whole if it is to be what it is stated to be &ndash; a mechanism to stop the trafficking in people and in human misery. The Minister's logic, such as it was, on Committee Stage was that the Bill would be abused if this amendment were allowed and could be circumvented by someone claiming to be an asylum seeker. Nobody would be caught because everyone would apply for asylum. The converse is also true. People who are genuine asylum seekers &ndash; and there are such people who are fleeing death or persecution &ndash; must be facilitated to enter the State. The <Col N="931" /> inclusion of those words, &ldquo;otherwise than in a lawful and bona fide manner&rdquo; defines that clearly enough.</P>
    <P>The Bill should have a defence. The person who assists someone into the State should have a defence if that person is granted refugee status or is a genuine asylum seeker. I know this is difficult and that the Minister is trying to frame a law that is not meaningless. If genuine asylum seekers are to be facilitated and assisted into the country, to which no one objects, provision must be made for that. This blanket provision which says that anybody who knowingly facilitates the entry into the State of somebody who intends to seek asylum should be guilty of an offence is too stark, broad and over-arching. We need some tempering of this measure to provide for the genuine person who is genuinely assisting a genuine asylum seeker. I need the reassurance of the Minister of State as to how that is to be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that trafficking in asylum seekers does not come within the scope of the Bill. The matter was discussed extensively on Committee Stage and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform explained that he could not possibly accept these amendments because to do so would mean that criminal organised groups who traffic in asylum seekers to this country would commit no offence. These traffickers can make large profits by exploiting loopholes in our law and by exploiting the vulnerability of asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>To accept these amendments would be explicitly to condone such behaviour and the whole purpose of the Bill, which is to criminalise the activities of such people, would be undermined. Because of the concerns raised on Second Stage that genuine assistance given to asylum seekers should not come within the scope of the Bill, the Minister brought forward an amendment which was agreed on Committee Stage and which ensures that it is broad enough to take in the activities of profiteers who traffic in human beings while at the same time qualifies the offence so that the activities of bona fide people who give assistance to non-nationals to come here do not come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment on Committee Stage did what the Deputies are trying to do.</P>

      <P>We all want to ensure that people who are profiteering from trafficking in human beings are covered by the Bill and that bona fide people who give assistance to non-nationals to come here do not come within its scope.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2)(f2&gt;a) on page 4 refers to &ldquo;anything done by a person otherwise than for gain&rdquo;. As a result of the amendment which has now been made to the Bill, the offence is committed only where the entry into the State of the illegal immigrant or asylum seeker is facilitated for gain. In other words, the offence catches the profiteers only, which is what we are all trying to do. Those who act for humanitarian purposes or because of family links and so on do not commit an offence under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Accepting the Deputies' amendments would make the Bill meaningless. Worse than that, it would mean that we condone the practice of trafficking in human beings which we do not want to do, which is a practice recognised internationally as a serious form of international organised crime and which we are being called on by a number of international bodies, including the European Union, to criminalise. The Deputies know this to be the case and I hope they will see that the amendment already made by the Minister does what they want to do. I hope they will understand why it would not be correct for me to accept their amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister of State's difficulty. I do not think our purposes are at odds. I recall the debate on Committee Stage and I am not sure that the simple exclusion of the words &ldquo;otherwise than for gain&rdquo; will meet the full requirement. I need to have this teased out further.</P>
      <P>Does this mean that payment for transport can be called a gain? If there is any payment for expenses involved in travelling is the defence negatived? This is an important point. I can see the difficulty in framing a provision that catches those who traffic in human misery, as it has been described, and distinguishes them from those who facilitate genuine asylum seekers to escape persecution. We must spend some time trying to achieve that balance. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State accepts the notion that profiteers should be caught and that there should not be an exemption for them. From that perspective I am well disposed to the argument against the amendments and, while I am convinced that those who traffic should be caught, I would be happier if those who facilitate genuine asylum seekers were not. Amplifying the exact interpretation of &ldquo;gain&rdquo; in this circumstance might allay my fears in that regard.</P>

        <b>:</b> I support what Deputy Howlin said. It is very important. We must include the positive as well as the negative. We must ensure that what we enact is set down in clear terminology. We welcome the Minister of State's amendment because it has clarified to a certain degree and to our satisfaction the intention behind the legislation. However, it is also important that, at all stages in the Bill, anything which adds further clarity should be included. Including &ldquo;otherwise than in a lawful and bona fide manner&rdquo; copperfastens the aim we are all supposed to be trying to achieve of allowing people do certain things in certain circumstances on the strict basis of the humanitarian considerations involved.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept the definition which Amnesty International has sought to have included or does she see it as nullifying or negating the Bill? Given that Amnesty International is pushing it so strongly, why can it not be accepted as the spirit within which a person comes to this country? They come on the basis that they have the right to asylum until such time as a final determination is made and they have been over the fences and through the hoops. I do not see why such an internationally accepted definition cannot be accepted without interfering with the general thrust of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Two different points have been made. I will deal with the point raised by Deputy Howlin first. I refer him to section 2(1) which states:</P>

      <P>Yes, but they are doing it for gain. The offence requires the intention and the knowledge. Merely taking payment for a ticket, an airline ticket, for example, does not constitute an offence. What is required is, first, an intention and, second, a profit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I could contribute to a person's flight to the far side of the world but I would not make a monetary gain by sending him there. Therefore, my contribution to his flight is obviously not for gain. What is at issue is the person who would gain from the person's transportation. The provisions should be read together. I hope the Deputy accepts that we have checked this thoroughly. If the issue of gain is not included, it offers a loophole for people organising trafficking. That is why the profiteering aspect must be included and why the amendment on Committee Stage distinguished between those who profit and those who are bona fide people giving assistance. Such people do not give assistance to a non-national for gain.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Jim Higgins is different. He is approaching this from the point of view of asylum seekers and their rights. I assure him that, while the Bill criminalises the activities of traffickers, including traffickers in asylum seekers, such criminalisation does not affect the rights of the individual asylum seeker. As far as the asylum seeker is concerned, the position concerning his or her admission to the State and the processing of his or her application remains unchanged. He or she will continue to be dealt with in accordance with all the procedures and rights appropriate under existing arrangements or under the Refugee Act when it is in operation. What comes within the scope of this Bill is the activity of the trafficker.</P>

        <b>:</b> My problem is with the use of the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;. An illegal immigrant is defined as &ldquo;a non-national who enters or seeks to enter or has entered the State unlawfully&rdquo;. We are jumping the gun and making a presumption. We are presupposing that someone is an illegal immigrant in the absence of a determination being made. People must be allowed apply for asylum and have their applications processed and appeals heard with possible redress to the courts before the word &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; can be valid terminology. One is not an illegal immigrant until one is found to be so. A rash presumption is being made in the Bill and I do not see why the door could not be left open so that a person would not be an illegal immigrant until such time as the asylum process has been undergone. That is why I wanted to include by means of my amendment that an illegal immigrant would mean a non-national, other than a presumptive refugee, who enters, seeks to enter or has entered the country unlawfully. Otherwise, it is jumping the gun and making a rash assumption. I do not understand why a suggestion from an internationally recognised authority on these matters and which monitors best practice in other countries cannot be accepted as part of the legislation. I will not push the matter. If the Minister of State believes she cannot accept it, so be it.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 28, after &ldquo;facilitates&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than for humanitarian reasons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We seek to do much the same as Deputy Howlin does in amendment No. 4. Section 2(1) states:</P>
      <P>A person who organises or knowingly facilitates the entry into the State of a person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to seek asylum shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
      <P>A range of penalties is then set out. Deputy Howlin seeks to insert &ldquo;otherwise than in a lawful and bona fide manner&rdquo;. I accept that. It is an excellent suggestion and I do not understand why it cannot be accepted for the sake of clarity. I seek to insert &ldquo;other than for humanitarian reasons&rdquo; in the first line of the subsection. I accept that, subsequently in the Bill, an amendment was inserted on Committee Stage by the Minister. However, I do not understand why, for the sake of certainty and maximum clarity, the amendments cannot be accepted. Deputy Howlin and myself seek to achieve that additional clarity.</P>
      <P>As we said previously on Committee Stage, thankfully in organisations there are individuals who are very unselfish in their motives. They have at all times sought to put the welfare of others ahead of their own. There are, for example, as we cited before, the Oskar Schindlers, the people who took considerable risks in Nazi dominated countries to try to secrete people in different guises and shapes and to try to siphon them out from Nazi dominated countries to safety. The people who did so at considerable risk to life and limb would have suffered the ultimate fate if they had been caught.</P>
      <P>I cannot see, therefore, why a rather simple but clear definition cannot be inserted here which proposes to accept the bona fides of the person, and the reason he or she decided to assist somebody. We are discussing motives of the highest order, which are strictly humanitarian, with no commercial consideration and which entail considerable risks for the people involved. I cannot see why it would not be acceptable to the Minister and her advisers to consider some simple insertion such as a person who organises or knowingly facilitates &ldquo;other than for humanitarian reasons&rdquo;. It could not be simpler. In other words, we should accept reasons that are strictly bona fide in assisting the people to leave the jurisdiction to escape torture or possible death and where there is no monetary gain involved.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage concerns were expressed that the Bill could make criminal offences the activities of the Oskar Schindlers of this world. To ensure this would not happen, a requirement has been inserted into the Bill and <Col N="936" /> the Deputies will agree that it has been improved by the provision that the assistance only becomes criminal if it is given for gain. Deputies will see that this approach sets the focus of the Bill firmly on the profit making traffickers and ensures beyond any doubt that non-profit making activity is excluded. The purpose of amendment No. 3 from Deputy Higgins is to provide that organising or facilitating the entry into the State of an illegal immigrant or asylum seeker for humanitarian reasons would not be regarded as trafficking. Assistance given for genuine humanitarian reasons is not for gain and therefore, the Government's amendment on Committee Stage ensures that such assistance is not considered to be an offence. I hope the Deputy accepts that.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are related. Amendment No. 6 is an alternative and looks at the ten year imprisonment proposed for breaches of this section and seeks to reduce it to five years. We had some debate on Committee Stage concerning this. When one looks at the list of offences punishable by ten years, the most recent one called into prominence is of soliciting to murder, on which a case was determined yesterday. The penalty for soliciting to murder is ten years. It is regarded as an extremely serious offence. In the terms of this Act, trafficking is a serious offence but five years imprisonment is also a very serious penalty and it is more appropriate than the ten years envisaged in the Minister of State's proposal. I hope she has had time to reflect on the case made on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>On community service, the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, provides a power to the courts to make community service orders relating to convicted persons and accordingly, it would already be open to the court to apply that power to a person convicted of an offence under this Act. Therefore, I reject the amendment on community service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to reducing the maximum term of imprisonment, which a court will impose follow<Col N="937" /> ing a conviction on indictment, from ten years to five years, the purpose of the Bill is to deal with those who traffick in human beings for profit. Such activity is not only of concern in this country but the link between traffickers and organised crime has been recognised at UN level and work is now progressing on the negotiation of protocols to the Draft UN Convention on Organised Crime which deal with the smuggling and trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, previously pointed out, the Heads of State of government of the European Union at the European Council meeting in Tampere, Finland, in October last considered the problem of trafficking in human beings and stated its determination to tackle illegal immigration at its source, especially by combating those who engage in trafficking and economic exploitation of migrants. They urged the adopting of legislation providing for severe sanctions against this serious crime. On the basis of a proposal by the Commission, it invited the Council of Ministers to adopt legislation to this end by the end of this year. The European Council furthermore urged member states, together with Europol, to direct their efforts towards detecting and dismantling the criminal networks involved.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Deputies' amendments will be to reduce the maximum term of imprisonment which a court may impose, following conviction on indictment, from ten years to five years. Such a reduced maximum sentence would be insufficient to deal with the traffickers who may be part of an international organised criminal group and would not be in keeping with the international effort to detect and dismantle the criminal networks involved in trafficking human beings.</P>
    <P>For this legislation to be effective against such groups, we must provide for the possibility of tough penalties. The ten year maximum sentence which the court can impose is not mandatory. It would be open to the judge to impose a lesser sentence where the circumstances of the case so warrant. On the other hand, accepting the amendments would mean that, faced with the most exploitative and organised trafficker in human misery, the judge would be restricted to imposing a maximum five year sentence. I am sure the Deputies would not wish to impose such a restriction on our courts and I ask them to withdraw this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is wrong. First, each trafficking offence is an offence. If one is talking about criminal gangs trafficking in multiples of people, each trafficking is an offence and each could bring a five year penalty. There could be very severe penalties of five, ten, 15, 20, 25 and multiples of five years for people who engage in serious trafficking because to traffick in an individual is an offence. If criminal gangs are involved, there can be huge penalties available to the courts. If an individual is involved, should the <Col N="938" /> House signal that to facilitate the entry of a single non-national into this State, that individual should have exactly the equivalence in criminal sanction as soliciting to murder that person? That is the case being made by the Minister. Is that her belief? Does she want this House to enact the same penalty for bringing an individual into the State through the port of Rosslare for gain, a non-national who is an asylum seeker? The Minister of State regards that as equivalent to soliciting to murder her or him in the penal sanction that she demands of this House. That is not an equivalence which is fair or just. There is a real sanction available to traffickers who undoubtedly exist and should be subject to the full sanction of the law and the multiple of penalties available.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the Minister's ability to break any criminal gangs since his report to the European Council last week indicated that there are already 13 criminal gangs in operation in this State. He has not exactly been a &ldquo;gang buster&rdquo; to date. Even this measure will not make a &ldquo;gang buster&rdquo; out of him. I would be much happier if he devoted his energies to breaking the gangs wreaking havoc on our streets and killing our citizens with infected heroin rather than seeking to put so much effort into this measure.</P>

        <b>:</b> I did not table amendment No. 5 for any vexatious reason or to frustrate the Minister of State or her officials. I did so to bring to the attention of judges something which is generally overlooked. The Minister states that the option is there to impose a community service order; we know that. If one looks at the <i>Roscommon Herald</i>, the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> or<i> The Western People</i> any week, one will find it is not being used. One finds the occasional enlightened judge who will use a community service order in certain situations.</P>
      <P>This Bill is typical. On summary conviction, there is a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. That is it. Generally speaking, one will find that under the terms of this, one or other will be imposed. Each Bill we have passed and will pass will have a custodial sentence or a monetary sentence or both. There will not be any reference to community service orders.</P>
      <P>All one has to do is look at the current prison population. There are about 10,800 people in prison. One quarter of those who will pass through the prison system and who will be ferried from Mayo, Roscommon, outer Dublin or Wexford to prisons around the country will be detained because of the non-payment of fines or civil debts and because they did not comply with the fine of £1,500, a financial penalty. That is the reason they will be in jail. We will have all the attendant costs involved. They will be collected in a patrol car, a hackney car or a taxi by three gardaí on overtime and will be put in jail but they will be out within a week wasting prison time, prison space, Garda time and, generally, the taxpayers' money. In most cases, these people could usefully serve out their sentence in the community doing positive work, contributing to the community and, at the same time, repaying their debt to society.</P>
      <P>I see no valid reason that we cannot stitch into every routine Bill, which becomes an Act of Parliament, a community service option or alternative. We need not specify the number of community service days or hours but we should include community service as an option. The squander mania of taxpayer money, Garda time and prison time by locking up people who should not be in jail in the first place is scandalous. The Government does not intend to do anything about it. We have two or three Bills languishing on the list of promised legislation. For example, we have the attachment of earnings Bill which has been there since 1997 and is no closer to publication today than it was in 1997 when the Minister drafted his legislative programme.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State and her senior supervisor, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, wherever he is, propose two penalties &ndash; one is £1,500 and the other is 12 months or both. My amendment says that is daft in certain situations, that is, to have one or other or both. The Minister of State could quite usefully save a great deal of duress in terms of time, taxpayers' money and hassle by including a more sensible amendment introducing a community service. That is what I propose, that is, that the Minister of State would introduce a community service provision. I am not pushed in terms of determining the number of hours, although I suggested 100 hours because I was trying to achieve some kind of equivalence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most legislation which passes through this House should carry an alternative sanction other than a monetary one. To put a monetary penalty of £1,500 on somebody who gets £60 or £70 per week on the dole or who earns £200 or £250 per week driving a lorry is not realistic and we know he will end up in jail. Rather than imposing a jail sentence for what should be a non-custodial sentence, we should opt for a community service order, which the Minister of State said a judge could opt for in certain circumstances. For that reason I am adamant and I will do this in every Bill which comes from the Minister's Department from now on. We should stitch in this provision to remind errant judges that there is an option available other than a financial penalty. If the fin<Col N="941" /> ancial penalty is defaulted upon, there will always be the option of another sanction &ndash; the community service order. That is the way to go, that is, to give somebody a pick or a shovel, a job to do or a plastic bag to pick up litter. Let them repay their debt to society in a more positive and productive way rather than simply throwing them into jail with all the costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been in office for three years and during that time it has had the opportunity to spend an extra £804 million on our education sector. Only a tiny proportion of that money was devoted to tackling the problems of the many people whom our education system has consistently failed. This debate relates to those whose concerns are not properly reflected in the priorities set by the Government. Who are we fooling when we talk about Ireland having the best education system in the world? The reality is much different. I will outline ten facts which will illustrate the grim realities of our education system to the House. These issues have not received the priority they deserve.</P>
      <P>First, today in our schools 45,000 children have serious reading and writing problems. This figure, recently released by the outgoing Minister, represents 10% of all children in primary education and a deterioration of one-third in the figure during the 1990s. The number of children in our primary education system who have serious reading and writing problems is getting worse. Second, 102,000 young people aged between 16 and 25, who are products of the new education system, have seriously defective reading skills, as reflected in surveys of adult literacy. That represents 17% of young people which is almost double the figure in other advanced countries surveyed at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, in a recent survey conducted by Fine Gael, we discovered that 65% of parents of children with special needs &ndash; those suffering from dyslexia, ADD or more serious disabilities such as autism or Down's syndrome &ndash; had to pay privately for an assessment of their child's needs. <Col N="943" /> Fourth, it is even more worrying that almost half those parents reported that as a result of that assessment a set of needs was identified for their children and almost none of them was being provided. Half of those who went to the trouble of getting their children assessed found that at the end of the day the school was unable to deliver the necessary supports. That is a sad indictment of the Government.</P>
    <P>Fifth, recent surveys by the OECD demonstrated that the rate of school absenteeism in Ireland is double that in most European countries. The sad fact is that survey after survey has highlighted that in disadvantaged parts of Dublin as many as a quarter of children are regularly absent and one-eighth are absent more than half the time. That is a chronic problem and Ireland is way out of line with its European partners. The prospect for those children is that they will drop out of school early.</P>
    <P>Sixth, we have also had evidence during the Government's stewardship of its impact on the remedial education system. Despite the best efforts of the many teachers involved in that field, the impact is sadly lacking. The education research centres states: &ldquo;Remedial teaching in schools which are designated as disadvantaged is not achieving any significant advance in the relative position of pupils who participate in the programme&rdquo;. Research uncovered a system where teachers are not properly resourced as they receive no in-service training or proper back-up and materials. They are totally over-stretched in terms of the number of children they try to serve. They are not able to make the contacts and links with parents that are necessary to make remediation a success. They are predominantly working the withdrawal system which takes the child away from the classroom rather than acting as a support to the class teacher. The remedial model in Ireland is under-resourced and supported and it is not making the necessary impact. Nothing is being done about it. The Government only talked about reviewing the guidelines. This issue is about more remedial teachers, better programmes and proper direction and back-up, not guidelines. Other Members will outline their experiences of that service.</P>
    <P>Seventh, the survey also revealed that 85% of pupils in need of remedial support in mathematics receive none. The result is an education system, about which we pretend to be proud and talk of as the best in the world, that reinforces inequalities and does not remove them.</P>
    <P>Eighth, the child of an unskilled manual worker is eight times less likely to reach third level than a child from a professional background. We have failed dismally to break that cycle of deprivation which traps people. Education in a republic such as ours is supposed to be the great source of equality of opportunity. That is not the case in Ireland. We stand out among our European colleagues in failing to provide children who do not succeed first time round with a second <Col N="944" /> chance and in terms of the high number of pupils who drop out without adequate support. We do not open our colleges and universities to children from disadvantaged areas. In such areas in my own constituency reading levels are three times worse than the figure of 10% recorded nationally. We are reinforcing disadvantage in our education system.</P>
    <P>Ninth, what is the consequence of that? Students who leave school with no qualifications are ten times more likely to be unemployed than third level graduates. That is the dream we create for those whom the education system fails. It is a life on the margins for many and that will characterise more and more those who fail to succeed in our education system. If we leave things as they are we will produce the long-term unemployed of tomorrow from our schools today. This issue needs to be taken more seriously by the Government.</P>
    <P>The final fact belying the truth about our education system is that only one in ten adults with literacy problems participates in any form of adult education. We talk about introducing such programmes but we are only scratching at the surface of the problem and reaching a tiny fraction of those who need support. While I applaud the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science for increasing budgets, we are still a long way from providing adult literacy programmes on a professional footing about which we could stand up and be proud.</P>
    <P>Article 42 of the Constitution is the bedrock on which education is based. It imposes on the State the obligation to provide free primary education. It also imposes on the State the obligation that it shall require, in view of actual conditions, that children receive a certain minimum education. The reality is that conditions have never been more favourable but the outcome for children who have difficulties has never been worse. I have no hesitation in condemning the Government in the motion because the greatest is expected of those who have opportunities. The Government came into office with £800 million to spend on education over three years, an increase of one-third in its budget. We would have said here is the opportunity when literacy will become a thing of the past. The opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science formally committed itself to a target in the national anti-poverty strategy in 1995 to eliminate literacy problems in our primary schools within five years. That time has come and gone and we have discovered in the past decade that literacy standards in our schools got worse, not better. We need radical new models and that is what I call for in the motion. We need more than funds and we must examine this problem in a more radical manner. The INTO and the TUI have highlighted the problems on disadvantage and literacy. They and the ASTI have called for millennium initiatives to deal with literacy in our schools, but their calls are falling on deaf ears. This is not a priority for <Col N="945" /> the Government. Not one extra remedial teacher has been given to a disadvantaged school since the Government took office. It has provided more remedial teachers but none to the disadvantaged schools where the exam results are the worst.</P>
    <P>As the motion says, we call for a radical change. This includes the development of speech therapy services, a specialist in-service training for learning support teachers to the highest international standards, proper resourcing of remedial education and learning support, new models for the use of remedial services in our schools, proper resources for resource teaching in our schools and regular reviews of the outcomes of remedial support. We must look afresh at the curriculum, at the whole model of school so that those who are now being turned away from our schools because of the way we run the education system will be cherished by them. We also need to put an end to the blight that is too much a feature of the education system. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Richard Bruton on moving this detailed motion. Sometimes when the Opposition introduces proposals or motions in the House the Government can bat them away as it outlines the measures it has taken and proposes to take. While I acknowledge that steps have been taken in recent years to improve matters, the sad fact remains that the five areas referred to in the motion are an indictment on us all.</P>
      <P>Given the performance of the economy, the improvements made in the area of special needs education are virtually insignificant. When the Minister replies to the motion he will outline the increased funding, the availability of remedial teachers to all and the improvement in the provision and delivery of support services for all categories of pupils with special education needs, at both primary and second level. From this side of the House many Members will refer to the remedial teacher who spends more time in the car than in the classroom, to the autistic child who has nowhere to go and to the mother who cannot afford speech therapy. We should not get bogged down in these shortcomings but go to the heart of the matter and acknowledge that through indifference, a lack of knowledge on our part or a lack of funding, we have failed many people over the generations because we failed to recognise or address their needs.</P>
      <P>Most of us were lucky enough not to have to stand in the back of the classroom. We take it as a given right that we can read a newspaper or a journal. Our challenge is to recognise what is our Goldenbridge or Madonna House. In time, the neglect of our special educational needs will be seen as our shame of the 1990s and the early years of this century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister will tell the House, but he would do a great service to many people who have been through the system and to <Col N="946" /> many children and parents currently using it if he acknowledged, on behalf of us all, that an injustice has been done, and, recognising that, assured us that he is seeking not just to improve things, but to put in place a service that will meet the needs of all. I realise this cannot be done overnight, but if the will is there it can eventually be achieved.</P>
    <P>While campaigning in the 1997 general election, not one person mentioned dyslexia to me, yet just two years later, on the first day of the local elections campaign, four different families raised the matter with me. They heard about it on the Pat Kenny Show. For them it existed in 1997 but they did not know what it was. At every opportunity afforded to me, here or elsewhere, I have tried to raise this matter. The weekend before last I met two mothers who asked me what is being done for their children who are dyslexic. They outlined to me how they have to drive so far for grinds, the cost involved and they questioned their treatment with regard to the Constitution and its commitment to education.</P>
    <P>Dyslexia affects people of all abilities, but there has been a failure on our part to recognise it. Most of the campaigners involved in special needs education have a personal connection. While I know this will not go down well with many of my colleagues, I contend that many teachers, including principals and remedial teachers, cannot recognise when a child is dyslexic. They cannot do so because the third level curriculum does not adequately cater for it. It if is recognised often they cannot address it as their approach is too peripheral and general. It is the equivalent of asking a GP to carry out an orthopaedic procedure or for a front row to stand in as out-half.</P>
    <P>We must have a radical rethink to address this problem. Professor Winifred Danwitz of College New Rochelle carried out research on Death Row which indicated that 85% of inmates fell into the special or particular needs category. Research at a juvenile delinquent centre in Scotland showed that 50% of the children surveyed were dyslexic, as opposed to 4% to 8% of the general population.</P>
    <P>People with dyslexia normally have a higher than average IQ and they can disguise the fact that they are dyslexic. However, in their frustration they hit back at society. If we address these difficulties we will not have a problem with prison spaces or an increase in violence. With a specialist approach what seems impossible can be achieved.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in the economy in that 200,000 people are in receipt of unemployment supports, while every year 10,000 people leave school early. They are the people with reading difficulties. We meet their mothers and wives every day of the week who tell us that the FÁS course they are on, and which they enjoyed, is coming to an end. As a result they are suffering from depression and cannot return to work. They do not want to work because they cannot, for <Col N="947" /> example, read a sign which warns that when entering a designated area that hard hats must be worn. We are obliged to provide these people with a service that will address this difficulty. It can be done if the will is there, but the Minister has a very difficult job to impress on the civil servants in his Department that the problem exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Richard Bruton for raising this very important matter. Despite all the talk of the Celtic tiger and the massive increase in revenue, the children in need of remedial and resource teachers are still being ignored, especially in rural areas. In some cases one remedial teacher is expected to give a service to five schools. As already stated in the House last Thursday, three County Monaghan schools will have teachers removed due to the lack of one pupil on a given day. I am very disappointed by the lack of support from the Minister and his Department in the light of the problems in the Border area and the specific issues arising in the schools there. Will he reconsider the position of these three teachers and provide a proper remedial resource service to ensure that young people with difficulty receive a basic education?</P>
      <P>St. Daig's national school, one of the schools mentioned, got its first remedial teacher in September 1999. She has now been placed on a panel, and, if the Minister does not do something about it, she will be replaced by another teacher who will not have any training in remedial work. This arises because the school was one pupil short due to a tragic loss of a child and another being sick on a given day. The girls' school in Castleblayney has no remedial or resource teacher on the staff and no access to educational psychologists. Ten children are awaiting educational assessment. The authorities in this school, on the same site as Our Lady's secondary school, which has disadvantaged status, cannot understand the lack of equal treatment. That school has the same right to be declared disadvantaged. If this happened it would retain its teacher.</P>
      <P>The other school to which I referred sent me a long letter. It will lose a teacher if nothing is done about it. The letter states:</P>
      <P>Our board of management has campaigned for over four years for a full time remedial appointment to cater for the needs of some 25 children who are educationally disadvantaged. They are at present catered for by a remedial teacher who has to commute between four schools in the parish. A thankless job for anyone, but one undertaken without complaint by the teacher in question. To date, our pleas for help have fallen on deaf ears. Platitudes and procrastination would seem to be the order of the day. No Celtic tiger here, more like a pussycat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this group we have five children who have been psychologically assessed as being on or below the tenth percentile and, as such, are entitled to a resources teacher. We got five <Col N="948" /> hours of resource teaching per week. This means one hour weekly per child, or, to be more precise, 12 minutes per day per child, to resolve this issue. If this is a serious effort to tackle educational disadvantage I do not buy into it.</P>
    <P>Added to this there are three children who suffer from emotional disorders, such as attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyper-active disorders, who are not even entitled to resource teacher hours. So, we ask, who is fooling who, where. The staff at our school are under no illusions in this regard.</P>
    <P>This letter typifies the reality of the situation. The Border area has suffered significantly over recent years. There is supposed to be a peace dividend but the Border area, in terms of the 25 teachers being lost nationally, is being asked to lose three locally. I beg the Minister to reconsider the situation before it is too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a widely accepted educational fact that some children cannot survive in an ordinary classroom situation. For one reason or another, they cannot keep pace with class progress. Remedial or special education is essential for such children to overcome their difficulties. They cannot succeed in a classroom where there may be up to 30 other pupils. They need individual attention to survive. In an ordinary classroom, a teacher cannot provide this level of attention because there are many other demands on his or her time. Individual attention is impossible.</P>
      <P>The current standard of remedial teaching available in primary schools is at best piecemeal and more often threadbare and wholly inadequate. I know areas where one remedial teacher must cover up to five or six different schools. The unfortunate teacher is obliged to spend more time travelling between schools than in the classroom. Such a service is nothing more than a shrivelled fig leaf; it is completely inadequate.</P>
      <P>Any primary school with four or five teachers should also have the full-time services of a remedial teacher. Priority must be given to remedial teaching at primary level. The earlier the service is provided for those who need it, the more successful it will be. The problem must be identified as soon as possible in the child's school career and immediately addressed. If prompt action is taken, remedial education helps children enormously and often enables them to return to a mainstream classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proper educational psychology service is a necessity to ensure that pupils with learning difficulties can be identified at the earliest possible age. The educational psychology service available at present is wholly inadequate. It is scandalous that Donegal has for so long been left without a resident educational psychologist and that the problem is only now being recognised. It is not unusual to have pupils waiting several years for a proper psychological assessment, which is essential in identifying the child's problem and how best to rectify it. Often the task of assessing the <Col N="949" /> pupil is left to the class teacher who may not have the qualifications or training for such a sensitive task. Every school child referred for assessment is entitled to have such an assessment carried out within weeks. It is unacceptable that there should be a waiting list of a year and often longer. Time is of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>Special facilities must be provided for remedial teachers. For example, there should be a classroom for remedial teaching in every primary school with four or more classrooms. It is unacceptable that remedial teachers are placed in the corner of an ordinary classroom, the cloakroom or sometimes in the corridor. I am aware of some schools where this is the case. Proper accommodation and facilities are an essential ingredient of the service.</P>
    <P>Education is a passport to life but our educational system leads to high levels of literacy and numeracy problems, as Deputy Bruton pointed out. It is obvious that the current remedial service is completely inadequate. More remedial teachers are urgently required, particularly at primary level. It is the principle of a stitch in time.

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on education. We have for some time fooled ourselves into thinking that we have a tremendous educational system and that all children are being looked after equally. The Constitution states that everybody must be treated equally, but the reality of our educational system is that, unfortunately, many children do not get the opportunities they deserve. They do not have the opportunity to develop their talents and, unfortunately, many of them leave school without the equipment to bring them through life.</P>
      <P>There is a system of remedial teaching around the country and in fairness to many of the teachers working in this service, they do their best with very scant means. As many of my colleagues outlined, some remedial teachers must travel from one school to another, particularly in rural Ireland, trying to cope with the students entrusted to them. Unfortunately, some teachers must cope with pupils in five different schools. They spend much time travelling from one school to another without guidance on how they should deal with the children, what type of service should be given to them and whether it is effective. Is there any assessment of the long-term benefits that accrue from that service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a school teacher, I am strongly of the opinion that if remedial education is to help in any way, a child needs it on a regular basis. I define this as each child needing a session every day. Having a remedial teacher in a school for half a day or even a full day a week is not effective because the child needs continual specialist education over a period to help him or her with <Col N="950" /> their difficulties. This is ideally achieved by the teacher dealing with him or her on a one-to-one basis every day. However, this cannot happen when a remedial teacher must deal with many schools and must travel between them.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably ask what I suggest is the solution to this problem. How does one cope with the problem in rural areas where schools do not have many pupils and they are spread over an area? As I suggested previously, although I do not know if it has ever been analysed in the Department, part-time teachers should be used. Why not take in part-time teachers for primary schools? Many teachers are now taking early retirement and they would be happy to do a small amount of teaching on a regular basis. They should be brought into schools for an hour each day and paid for their work. They have the expertise and the knowledge because they taught for years. They could provide a valuable service and this suggestion should be considered.</P>
    <P>Regarding facilities for remedial teachers in some schools, it is an insult to many of them that they must give tuition in corridors, cloakrooms or elsewhere. The service is being provided on a shoe string. This is reflected in the type of services that exist. What type of grant aid is available for books or equipment? What about the use of modern technology for dealing with particular difficulties? Is grant aid available in that regard?</P>
    <P>There is a need for remedial teaching in second level schools. To a great extent, the remedial services in second level schools are not adequate. I recently received a letter from a pupil in a school that I visited and I was amazed at its contents and the way it was set out. This pupil had already spent approximately nine years in school. There is an urgent need to review the remedial services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently sent out a research questionnaire to teachers involved in providing services for children with learning difficulties or disabilities that create special educational needs in County Sligo and I was shocked at the findings. One principal commented, &ldquo;please, we need educational psychologists. Psychologists should go to schools and all concerned draw up programmes. There is little communication between health boards in this area.&rdquo;  Another comment was:</P>
      <P>I feel that integration in principle is very good. However, back up services are poor. Funding is inadequate and much is left to the individual class teacher. In special schools teachers are 1:8 pupils. However, in mainstream schools, an allowance is not made for this.</P>
      <P>A further comment was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools, parents and pupils should be provided with necessary aids, finances, etc. They should not have to go and beg or fight for them. Having a shared support teacher between five schools is paying only lip service to remedial education. Each child gets ten to 15 minutes <Col N="951" /> twice a week. Group work can be unsatisfactory as each child is experiencing different problems and needs one to one attention. I feel that the amount of resources and teachers available for children with special needs is unsatisfactory. More money needs to be spent at national level for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The level of resources and teachers available for children with special needs is unsatisfactory. More money needs to be spent at national level for children with special needs. The principal believes the questionnaire is loaded towards assuming that one believes integration is right for all children, whereas there should be a choice for parents to opt for a special class or school or for a normal system. The principal likes the idea of integration. A child who attends his local school is entitled to the same services as a child who attends a special school. A great deal of back-up is needed for integration to succeed. If support is not provided, integration will not work and the child will lose out.</P>
    <P>Special needs education is so important that no longer should we only say that each school has a remedial teacher but that the fuller needs of the children concerned should be addressed by providing a teacher for at least three two teacher schools in one cluster. We should also have access to educational psychologists as required. The principal cannot get four children assessed by an educational psychologist and some of these will leave the national school system in a year or so.</P>
    <P>A principal in one of the schools in my county feels it is important to keep children with their peers in the local school but that teachers need more training, resources and physical back-up to help them in their new task of teaching children with special needs. Having a child with special needs should not take from the teaching time allowed for the other 25 to 30 children. We do not have a special plan as the children with special needs are treated as part of the whole school. The experts in this area are the remedial and resource teachers. They should be asked to devise plays, etc. Extra capitation grants are needed for special needs pupils in ordinary schools.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Richard Bruton for raising this important issue. It is clear from the replies of 30 schools in my county to 30 questionnaires that there are not any facilities for remedial teaching, not to mention the huge area of dyslexia. At a time of unprecedented wealth, it is a sad indictment that so many schools and principals in County Sligo feel aggrieved at the lack of services and commitment. There is something wrong with the Department which has allowed that to happen at a time when we have millions of pounds to spend. Pupils who cannot read are leaving primary school. Dyslexia is a problem for many parents. I hope the Minister will respond positively to the debate.</P>

I taught for almost 30 years and the absence of a psychological service was an injustice to all the children during that time. The absence of a psychological service now is continuing the damage.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the appointment of 25 psychologists at Christmas?</P>
      <P>When the teachers met in January they were told that 25 psychologists had been appointed. They were then told at a meeting of congress that a further 25 had been appointed, which brought the total to 50. When the Minister was on the radio recently with Deputy Richard Bruton he announced a further 50 appointments. Is the Minister adopting a Green Party policy of recycling psychologists? Is he reappointing the 50 psychologists? The teachers want to know how many are in position.</P>

      <P>Some of my teaching colleagues are upset that the south-east, which has no Minister, has the worst record when it comes to the appointment of psychologists. One Minister managed to get two psychologists for his county, although I presume that was done on merit alone. In the interest of cherishing all the children of the nation equally and in an attempt to honour Pearse and his colleagues, I ask the Minister to ensure that the appointment of psychologists is on a fair basis because children throughout the country need to get their rightful share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for answer tomorrow on the appointment of class assistants for junior infants. In my former school 35 new junior infants will start in September and the teacher will not only be expected to teach them but to train them to stay in the classroom. My colleague from Wicklow was critical of teachers but I assure him that one would need more than a captain and an army in <Col N="953" /> a classroom when five junior infants decide they want to go to the toilet at the same time.</P>

      <P>As someone who is not a teacher, I will try to represent a broader section of the people. I wish well those doing the junior and the leaving certificates. As someone who has a child doing the leaving certificate, I am opposed to children's lives being dependent on the leaving certificate, which is the most important examination they must do during their lifetime. Last weekend in my constituency the sister of a young girl who is doing the leaving certificate was killed in a road accident. That young girl is under great pressure. That is the type of pressure on children today. I listened to programmes on local radio and on RTE yesterday about the leaving certificate during which they hyped it up. This upsets young people and puts more pressure on them. I want to know the Minister's views on assessment. I am not afraid to say I do not agree with one examination deciding what a student will do or how he or she will fare for the rest of his or her life. It is wrong and it is time we put a system in place so that children who may not perform well on the day of an examination will have a second chance.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Richard Bruton for tabling this motion this evening. I also congratulate him for working hard on his brief in recent years and for highlighting the difficult problems in education.</P>
      <P>I listened to my colleague speaking about the education system. Three months ago a woman came into my clinic in County Mayo and she did not know what was wrong with her child who was in sixth class. The child was not able to write or to learn and she said she would have to get him assessed. The child was diagnosed as having dyslexia. I was annoyed to see that woman crying in my constituency office but I was more upset that she had to pay for her child's assessment, although she and her husband were on social welfare. I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister to find out what the Department would do for that child who cannot read or write and who will be going to secondary school next September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told our education system is the great<Col N="954" /> est system in the world. If that is true, how could a child slip through the net and move from first class to sixth class without being able to read or write? The mother, a social welfare recipient, had to pay for the child to be assessed. That is not a wonderful or fair system. There is something wrong when that happens. Recently, I attended a meeting in Castlebar of 80 parents of children with special needs. These parents are upset, frustrated and annoyed listening to Government spin doctors talk about the Celtic tiger and how the economy has grown. The Minister for Finance says we should be partying because there is so much money in the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the greatly increased levels of investment in education being made by the Government and, in particular, the introduction of measures by the Minister for Education and Science to prioritise the tackling of literacy and numeracy and educational disadvantage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Minister, I am deeply committed to the development of education. It is the engine that drives the Celtic tiger. It is through education that we, as a people, now have the wealth and resources to develop a truly inclusive society and that is what this Government is doing. We have never invested as much in education as we are investing this year. The Government has made education a top priority for its term of office and, on day one of my appointment, I set as my key priorities the urgent tackling of literacy, numeracy, special needs and disadvantage. We will press on with major developments at the leading edge of education, research and development but this time we will ensure that those who are disadvantaged or have special needs get extra special support and attention. We had problems in the past but we are making great progress in tackling them and we will do much better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to report on the progress the Government has made since taking office in 1997. Conscious of the work that remains to be done, I will set out the strategies that are in place to tackle the serious problems which continue to confront some pupils. Over the past three years, this Government has achieved success across a number of fronts in education, <Col N="955" /> from pre-school to adult education and beyond. It has increased the education budget to £3.294 billion, a 43% increase on the 1997 budget; provided £13.35 million this year for the largest ever programme of teacher in-career development &ndash; this represents a 100% increase on the 1997 allocation; enacted the first Education Act and implemented many of its elements; undertaken a wide-ranging review of school attendance legislation culminating in the Education Welfare Bill which is progressing though this House; published the first Teaching Council Bill; published the first White Paper on Early Childhood Education &ndash; a blueprint for the development of early education; reduced pupil teacher ratios to 18:1 and 20.4:1 at primary level&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has ensured that every child with special needs in every school has access to remedial teaching. It has ensured that every child with a special need has an automatic right to have this need met in the education system. As a result of this the number of resource teachers assisting children with special needs in integrated settings in the primary system has been increased from 104 in October 1998 to 450 at present and the number of special needs assistants in the primary system has been increased from 299 to 1,095. It has ensured that since September 1999 the pupil teacher ratios in all special schools and special classes catering for children with disabilities have been reduced to the level recommended by the special education review committee. It has made funding of £845,000 available in the current year for the purchase of special equipment for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>Despite this progress and these successes the Government is keenly aware that while it has made great strides in recent years much remains to be done. We cannot afford to be complacent. I am particularly concerned at the continuing evidence of literacy and numeracy difficulties in children leaving school and in the population generally. This cannot be allowed to continue. As I mentioned earlier, I have made this a priority for my time in office. We have always prided ourselves on the quality of our education yet, despite the high quality of our teachers, programmes and materials, recent figures show unacceptable levels of literacy in the population. I am determined to tackle literacy problems at all levels. We must ensure that no child will leave our primary schools without an adequate standard of literacy and numeracy. This is the legacy we must leave to those generations that will follow us. All citizens must be equipped with the basic skills they need to allow them to participate fully in, and contribute to, society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National surveys of reading in primary schools have been carried out by my Department in co-operation with the Educational Research Centre from 1972 to date. The aim of the surveys is to <Col N="956" /> monitor levels of English reading attainment in primary schools on an ongoing basis. Survey information shows that between 6.5% and 9.5% of Irish 11 year old pupils have serious literacy difficulties. The 1995 International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMMS, showed that the mean mathematics scores of Irish pupils in the class grades surveyed were higher than the corresponding international mean mathematics scores. Irish pupils were placed seventh of 16 countries in the third class survey and sixth of 17 countries in the fourth class survey. This data from both national and international surveys gives a detailed picture not only of our position in literacy and numeracy relative to other countries but also of the difficulties of a significant minority of pupils at different age levels.</P>
    <P>I say all this merely to put matters into perspective, not as a sign that I am complacent. I am not. I am very aware of the problem but I am also convinced that it can be solved. My objective is to raise standards of literacy and numeracy, beginning at the levels of individual children and schools. My aim in allocating resources is to focus on the lowest functioning pupils and on the schools where the largest proportion of pupils achieve at a very low level. It is in these cases that the available resources can make a difference. With these children and in these schools we must focus on reading.</P>
    <P>Reading is still the main avenue to education and to occupational and social success. It is essential not only to success in our daily lives but also to further learning throughout life which is so vital to our economic and social development. The Government has a range of strategies in place to support those pupils who are low achievers or who have serious difficulties in learning or numeracy.</P>
    <P>The revised English primary curriculum places a major emphasis on the development of literacy skills. It focuses particularly on the prevention of reading difficulties and embodies state of the art guidelines on the development of reading as a whole language approach. It focuses also on the development of emerging literacy skills and phonetic awareness in pupils. The revised curriculum is being supported by a comprehensive programme of in-service education for teachers. Prepared under the guidance of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment it will have a major impact on raising literacy standards.</P>
    <P>The remedial teacher is the backbone of our strategy for addressing the needs of pupils with serious learning difficulties. Since this Government took office it has significantly increased the number of remedial teachers in our schools. There are currently 1,463 remedial teachers allocated to primary schools. They cover every primary school. We have also increased the number of remedial teachers in second-level schools. There are now some 560 whole time equivalent posts in second-level schools.</P>
    <P>Since September 1999 the remedial teacher service has been extended to every first and second-<Col N="957" /> level school with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. Schools with lower ratios are free to apply to my Department for remedial support where they can demonstrate a need for the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I raise a question on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have time, Deputy. Remedial teachers work with the weakest and provide these pupils with extra teaching support.</P>
      <P>I will shortly publish revised guidelines on learning support. These guidelines are a direct response to the recommendations of a study on remedial education commissioned by my Department and carried out by the Education Research Centre. They have been drawn up following extensive consultation with representatives of parents, school management and teachers. They are at the cutting edge and embrace all that is best in remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>The new guidelines will ensure that the objective of learning support will be more clearly identified. They will set the role of the teacher firmly in the context of a whole-school approach, with emphasis on the complementary roles and shared responsibilities of the class teacher and the learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>Training for serving remedial teachers is being provided on postgraduate diploma courses in selected colleges of education and universities. This intensive training enables the remedial teachers to identify children with learning difficulties in both reading and mathematics, to diagnose the exact nature of those difficulties and to provide remedial tuition.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department financially supports many shorter courses for teachers in the remedial and special education areas. These are provided mainly through the network of education centres, teachers' associations and an extensive programme of summer courses for primary school teachers. The new guidelines will be underpinned by specific training for teachers.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education and Science, I would be seriously concerned that any parent of a special needs child should feel that the needs of his or her child are not being adequately addressed. Since taking office, this Government has undertaken an unprecedented level of development in special education services. Arising from a Government decision in October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their disability or location. The response may take the form of resource teacher support, child care support or both, depending on the needs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already, as a result of this development, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has been increased from 104 in October 1998 to 450 at present. The number of special needs assistants helping children with special needs has been increased from 299 to 1,095 in the same per<Col N="958" /> iod. I will continue to allocate further resources in response to need.</P>
    <P>In addition, the special pupil teacher ratios applied to all special schools and special classes catering for children with special needs have been reduced to the level recommended by the Special Education Review Committee.</P>
    <P>My Department is encountering significant difficulties in securing speech therapy services from the health boards to support special schools and special classes catering for children with speech and language difficulties. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is aware of this difficulty and is seeking to address it.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure in response to the shortages of professionals in these disciplines, and pending the outcome of the work of a task force, arrangements are being made to increase the number of places available for the coming academic year. The Higher Education Authority will also explore the possible use of postgraduate conversion courses.</P>
    <P>The Government established a National Educational Psychological Service Agency with effect from 1 September 1999. This service is being developed on a phased basis over five years. Our objective is to ensure that all schools will have access to the service by the end of 2004. As part of this process, I have increased the number of psychologists in the service from 43 to almost 100 with effect from September 2000.</P>
    <P>While these developments constitute a major advance in the quality of our special education services, I fully recognise that much more remains to be done. Where the parents of children with special needs are concerned, I am anxious that the system be made more responsive and supportive.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I have asked a planning group within my Department to review our current approach to special education services. I have also asked the group to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service for students with special needs. I expect to receive the report of the planning group in the near future and I assure the House that I will respond positively to any proposals which will support children with special needs and their parents.</P>
    <P>We must be happy that the resources which we are putting into this area are raising standards and targeting those pupils most in need of assistance. All primary classes from first to sixth will be supplied with standardised, norm-referenced tests of literacy for use by their pupils. Teachers are also being provided with profiles of pupil achievement in English &ndash; the Drumcondra English Profiles &ndash; to complement the standardised tests.</P>
    <P>The use of this combination of tests will assist class teachers in effectively monitoring the progress of their pupils and in identifying, at an early stage, those who may be experiencing reading difficulties. Such monitoring and early detection will <Col N="959" /> result in earlier intervention and reduce the numbers of those with serious difficulties. I intend also to put in place a programme of national surveys of English reading at primary level. These will be done on a regular basis in conjunction with the Education Research Centre.</P>
    <P>The national reading initiative was launched on 21 January and is a genuine effort to tackle the problem of poor reading in the population generally and to promote reading. The initiative acknowledges that the problem of low achievement and under-achievement is not just a school-based problem. It stresses the importance of parents encouraging their children to read by reading to them and by listening to their children reading.</P>
    <P>The initiative is pursuing the twin objectives of raising public awareness of the importance of developing reading skills and helping to maximise the literacy support services that are already available. It is a community-wide initiative, collaborating with schools, libraries and voluntary community groups to target people who cannot read at all, people who cannot read very well and want to improve, people who can read but do not and people who read a good deal.</P>
    <P>The initiative is running a number of national events and is also providing support for organisations that are engaging in activities designed to promote literacy development. The events proposed for the year cover a wide geographical spread and include people of all abilities and ages.</P>
    <P>To focus our work in the area of reading, I am appointing a national director for literacy and a project team to get the maximum benefit from the steps we are taking. I will shortly outline the details of these plans and I expect the advertisements to fill these positions to appear in the national press in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that an international adult literacy survey of 12 countries conducted in 1995 and published in 1997 provided a profile of literacy skills of adults ages 16 to 64. The survey found that Ireland scored badly in the overall literacy tasks and indicated a serious problem in functional literacy among Irish adults. It showed that early school leavers, older adults and unemployed people were most at risk of literacy difficulties, with participation in adult education and training being least likely for those with the poorest skills.</P>
    <P>The response of this Government has been quick and comprehensive. The provision in the education sector for adult literacy increased substantially from a base of £850,000 in 1997, when the Government took office, to £7.825 million in 2000. The national development plan provides for an investment of £73.8 million in the coming years in adult literacy, which will be supplemented by a £1 billion investment under a back to education initiative providing for an expansion of part-time Youthreach, PLC and VTOs options. This will become an important <Col N="960" /> bridge from literacy tuition to certified learning points.</P>
    <P>Recent Government initiatives in the area of adult literacy will be covered by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, later in the debate. It is clear, however, that the Government has put considerable investment into the area.</P>
    <P>A White Paper on adult education and lifelong learning is in the final stages of preparation and will be published very soon. It will deal in a comprehensive way with the Government's strategy on adult education, including adult literacy. It will deal also with the national and regional structures to be put in place to support adult education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I am conscious that we must make our education system more responsive to and inclusive of individuals who are less advantaged, those who have special needs or who left the system in previous years without having access to the range of opportunities available today. They deserve a second chance.</P>
    <P>To tackle disadvantage effectively, an all-encompassing strategy is needed. We need to intervene early, we must raise awareness of the benefits of early childhood education, we must assist parents in helping their children to learn and develop and we must raise standards in provision, giving priority to those most in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, currently, at primary level, financial and staffing supports are allocated to those schools deemed to serve children associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. These designated schools receive enhanced capitation grants and many are allocated concessionary or ex-quota staffing. The ongoing expansion of the home-school-community liaison scheme promotes co-operation between parents and teachers in support of young people's learning. The Early Start pre-school project supports the transition from the home to school life of three to four year olds from disadvantaged backgrounds. These programmes are effective.</P>
    <P>Schools in the urban and rural dimensions of Breaking the Cycle receive grants for books, teaching and learning materials and local initiatives and benefit from a range of other supports. Teachers deployed in the &ldquo;Support Teacher&rdquo; project assist children with disruptive, disturbed and withdrawn behaviours and help schools staffs in the formulation of policy.</P>
    <P>Primary and second level schools are involved in the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative introduced by the Government in September 1998. The current projects will end on 30 June next and an evaluation report on their operation will be available in September. However, I am convinced of the usefulness of these projects and have decided to provide the resources for a new phase of the projects in the initiative from 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002. The services of the <Col N="961" /> projects' co-ordinator will also be retained for that period.</P>
    <P>Certain second level schools are also designated by my Department as serving young people from areas of disadvantage. These schools now receive enhanced capitation grants, they are allocated concessionary ex-quota staffing &ndash; a &lsquo;disadvantaged' post &ndash; and they receive support to make possible the full-time allocation of a teacher on home-school-community liaison duties.</P>
    <P>I am engaged in preparing a multi-sectoral three-year programme that will assign a massive £193 million to the support of people at risk of or who are actually experiencing educational disadvantage. The funding will be assigned at pre-school level, at primary, post-primary and third levels and in the area of lifelong and continuing education.</P>
    <P>At primary level, I have commissioned a survey of all primary schools by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra and that work is nearing completion. The purpose of the survey is to identify those schools that have the highest levels of concentration of pupils with background characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. This will greatly help us in tackling disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I will make significant financial and staffing resources available in September to the selected schools that have the highest concentrations of at risk pupils and these resources will be increased substantially over the following two years. The supports will be allocated on a new basis that will differ significantly from the designated school approach at present in operation.</P>
    <P>Supports for second-level schools under the new programme will be allocated under the &ldquo;Stay in School&rdquo; retention initiative. This initiative is concerned with increasing completion rates to senior cycle through strategies that counteract early school leaving. Selected schools must work in co-operation with local statutory and voluntary agencies to prepare plans to support young people at risk and their families. There are currently 57 schools in the initiative and I have decided to increase this number to 116 schools next September. I have also decided to recruit another co-ordinator, in addition to the existing two co-ordinators, to support the development of the initiative in schools.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the strategies outlined are those most supportive of schools, teachers and parents. The most effective route to improving reading standards in schools generally and to reducing the numbers of pupils with serious learning difficulties in literacy and numeracy is at the level of the individual pupil in the individual school. I will give every support to teachers and their pupils in tackling the persistent proportion of the community whose talents have been neglected for far too long.</P>
    <P>I have noted the points raised by Members and I hope they recognise that the Government will implement a major plan of action during the next two years. This plan will have a major impact in <Col N="962" /> terms of resolving the problems to which they referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone agrees that education provides an escape from deprivation and unemployment and, for most people, it represents the guarantee of a good future. The majority of Members will also agree that our education system, particularly the parts which relate to technology and computers, is the foundation on which the success enjoyed by the State is based. Successive Governments have responded to that success by ensuring that investment has been made in the areas to which I refer.</P>
      <P>It is the priority of this Government that investment should be made, not only at the top but also at the lowest levels of society. We should not lose sight of the fact that basic literacy and numeracy are crucial to success in other spheres. People from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special needs deserve additional attention, funding and support.</P>
      <P>The focus in schools has changed in recent years. Many demands are being placed on teachers and schools, not merely in terms of providing extra-curricular activities but, for example, in teaching computer science and foreign languages in primary schools and in ensuring that all students in secondary school pursue science subjects. It is, perhaps, as a result of this change in focus that basic skills such as reading and numeracy were not given sufficient attention.</P>
      <P>The Government has adopted a new approach which emphasises the importance of reading. It gave grants to school libraries last year for the purpose of buying new books and this development has encouraged young people to read. The calibre of books on offer has improved greatly in recent years. When I launched the &ldquo;Children's Books Ireland&rdquo; summer school recently, I asked that those responsible for running the school focus directly on the needs of children rather than on those of librarians, teachers and parents. This will encourage young people to abandon their Gameboys and computer games, develop a love of learning and reading and improve themselves.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate, but studies and surveys show that too many 11 year olds are not reaching the required standard in numeracy and literacy. I suggest that earlier testing might ensure that this problem is identified and addressed at an earlier stage. By training more remedial teachers, giving every school in the country access to them and ensuring that they operate in classes with a low pupil-teacher ratio and by decreasing the pupil-teacher ratio in general, we have created a situation where children receive more attention. The home-school liaison scheme offers encouragement to parents, through their involvement in the scheme, who did not ever have an opportunity to advance their education. These initiatives are working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools have shown great resourcefulness in this area. A school in my locality has identified <Col N="963" /> 20 students, carried out psychological assessments in respect of them, recognised the level of their learning abilities and set about giving them the attention they require. The school is working with local agencies and the parents of the children to provide individual programmes which are supported by their teachers and the Department.</P>
    <P>Given that learning difficulties must be identified early, the Government is correct to focus on primary schools. When children with such difficulties reach second level, nothing can be done for them because of the nature of the curriculum and the pressure caused by examinations. However, three levels have been introduced in respect of the junior certificate which means that the pressure will be taken off those students who cannot perform as well as others. They will now be able to achieve success at a lower level. It is appropriate to mention this development given that so many children started examinations today. The number of additional remedial teachers working in disadvantaged areas has proven a great help in this regard, as has the increased involvement of parents.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in children with special needs. Having visited one of the special schools recently, I can only commend and congratulate those involved for the tremendous work they do. The special schools are an example of the way the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children can work closely together. However, increasing numbers of parents want their children to be integrated into mainstream schools. It is important that the two Departments work to ensure that those children who move out of special education do not lose any of the special attention they receive &ndash; I refer here to the provision of medical facilities, etc. &ndash; and that they continue to receive it when they enter the mainstream education system. These children deserve our specific attention and the Government is working towards catering for them in order that we do not continue with the problem of adult illiteracy we have already witnessed. Teenage girls who become pregnant and want to leave school deserve particular attention and I hope the expenditure in the area of child care will ensure that more community groups are established to prevent such young women from abandoning their education. I hope that through the Education (Welfare) Bill, they will be tracked to ensure they gain the full benefits of education.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to providing resources and supports to ensure that education, from the bottom basic level to the top technological level, is serviced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the day on which 120,000 students sat the first papers in their junior and leaving certificate examinations, it is appropriate and important that we consider the many thousands of people which the State education system has failed, those people who should, by right, be <Col N="964" /> sitting exams today but who, through educational disadvantage, are not participating.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest failures of our education system to date has been the failure to target substantial resources and supports at children who are educationally disadvantaged. Today, there is no excuse for this failure as money is available. The problem now appears to be a lack of political will on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the previous Minister survived his period in office was extraordinary. We should not be too hard on the current Minister as he has only been in office for a short time but we have every right to be very critical of his predecessor, Deputy Martin, whose term of office was marked by a triumph of image over substance. He adopted a scatter-gun approach and, through a well oiled PR machine, managed to come through a three year period as Minister for Education and Science quite unscathed and with his public image enhanced. Public opinion will, on closer examination, change in regard to the lack of achievement in education over the past three years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin failed to target the educationally disadvantaged. He gave a little bit to everybody and while that may have been successful in keeping teachers' unions on board, it did not do anything to tackle the very serious problems of educational disadvantage. None of these problems is insurmountable and they could all be dealt with if a systematic and determined approach to tackling them were adopted. We are not talking about very widespread problems, rather we are talking about very serious problems concentrated in a relatively small number of areas. All that is required to tackle them is political will and additional funding. Unfortunately, that will has not been evident to date. During Deputy Martin's three year term of office, he did not do anything at all to assist areas of educational disadvantage. He did not introduce any educational initiatives, nor did he expand the existing ones which had been put in place by his predecessor.</P>
      <P>The current Minister, on taking up office, announced that he would make a priority of tackling educational disadvantage. I hope he will and am sure that Deputy Bruton, like myself, will pursue him on that. We will watch the Minister very closely because this is an area which has been very seriously neglected in recent years. We have yet to see any substance in regard to the Minister's promise. The Minister, in his speech, appeared to be attempting to draw a line in the sand under the work of his predecessor because there is very little to boast about from the past in regard to educational disadvantage. The Minister did not really have any option but to speak about his intentions for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large part of the Minister's speech was quite worthy in regard to his aspirations but three years have already been lost and this Government does not have much longer to run. We need urgent action in the areas which have been crippled by the lack of adequate investment. It is interesting to observe what is happening in areas in which <Col N="965" /> drug task forces have been set up as these are the most disadvantaged areas in many different ways, including educationally. Each of those task forces has come to the conclusion in recent years that the missing link in regard to tackling disadvantage is the failure of the Department of Education and Science to play a full part. The task forces, which have carried out very thorough and intensive examinations on the ground, have highlighted the type of issues which have led to widespread disadvantage in their areas.</P>
    <P>The familiar chant by this Government of what the previous Government did or did not do is simply not acceptable in this debate. The Government has three years under its belt but, unfortunately, has little or nothing to show in terms of dealing with special education needs, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Not only has the Government not extended or built upon the initiatives which were in place but, in some cases, it has watered them down. I am referring in particular to the very successful Breaking the Cycle scheme. To date, the Minister has not come up with any ideas in regard to this scheme.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I read an Adjournment debate matter raised by my colleague, Deputy Upton, last week on the Breaking the Cycle scheme in regard to the variation in numbers and the withdrawal of teachers. When the scheme was set up initially, a commitment was given that teachers would not be withdrawn for the five year duration of the pilot scheme. Unfortunately, that commitment has been rolled back by the current Government. It was interesting to read the reply from the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, in which he did not really offer any kind of defence because there is not any defence to a broken promise. In the course of his five minute reply, the Minister of State failed to tackle the issue or to offer any hope to the schools in which the scheme is operating which face teacher losses. Perhaps the Minister will clarify this issue for us as he was unable to be present for the Adjournment debate in question. It is outrageous that where schools have invested a huge effort and where the operation of the Breaking the Cycle scheme has resulted in very real gains which continue to increase, much of that work is to be set at nought by the withdrawal of teachers.</P>
    <P>It is undeniable that the problem of lower literacy and numeracy is concentrated by and large in areas of social disadvantage. Under the previous Administration, an effort was made for the first time to reduce this problem through the introduction of the Breaking the Cycle scheme. It is one thing not to extend the programme but it is another to ignore the ground rules and roll back on earlier commitments.</P>
    <P>The people who remain long-term unemployed or those who are only marginally attached to the labour force have not benefited from the education system. They did not receive the support they deserved. In classes of 30, 40 or 50 people, they were not catered for because of the failure <Col N="966" /> to target their special education needs. The Government's decision to dilute the Breaking the Cycle scheme is extraordinary and will create a very familiar destiny for children who have been educationally disadvantaged. The life prospects of a 12 or 13 year old child who has dropped out of school are bleak and the likelihood is that he or she will be long-term unemployed. There is also a strong possibility that such people will become involved in drugs abuse or delinquency and become homeless at some point in their young lives.</P>
    <P>Many appalling prospects face young people who drop out of school at an early age. That these figures continue to be so high is an extraordinary indictment of a Government and an education system which has access to funding and research, and which should know better. The Government knows where resources should be targeted and yet does not have the will to put them there.</P>
    <P>Recent figures show that the investment by the State in the various stages of education increases as one goes through the different stages. State investment in primary level is £1,786 per pupil and rises to more than £4,000 per student at third level. For those few children who have access to State-funded early education in the form of Early Start, the investment is £1,430 per pupil. Clearly this anomaly represents a need to balance expenditure and focus more resources on the child's formative years in the education system.</P>
    <P>Pre-school has been identified as a crucial intervention in preventing early school leaving. However, access to pre-school is very limited and has simply not been a focus for attention by the Government. It was interesting to listen to the Minister's 25 minute speech, and I do not believe he once referred to pre-school education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area which traditionally has been the Cinderella of the education system and while the Minister has responsibility for it, there is little or no investment in it. In spite of recent work we still do not know the Minister's intentions with regard to developing this area. There has been a scatter-gun approach and much of this has been left to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the grounds that there will be child care developments if parents are facilitated in returning to the workforce but not once are the children's' needs referred to or their rights to have access to early education. The reality is that parents who can afford pre-school services will avail of private services which are operated locally, but where people cannot pay for a private service or where private services simply are not available in local areas because they may not be feasible financially, or there may not be somebody in the local area who is prepared to provide pre-school services, often children in disadvantaged areas start school at the age of four or five already at a disadvantage compared to their classmates or certainly compared to the four and <Col N="967" /> five year olds starting school down the road in the local middle class school. Unless there is early intervention, those kinds of problems will simply be compounded where there are children starting at a disadvantage and the gap will widen as the child progresses in the school system.</P>
      <P>Early intervention has been recognised generally as an important tool in childhood services. Individual attention in the classroom, which can only be delivered through increased provision of remedial teachers and smaller class sizes, will ensure greater progression of students in the education system.</P>
      <P>When a child starts school, detection of learning problems should be identified at as early an age as possible. If there was a properly funded pre-school service, this could happen from the age of three. What could be done if problems were being detected at that stage rather than left to fester until, if the child is lucky, his or her problem is picked up at the age of nine or ten or even later, when the child has to wait a considerable time for the appropriate service to take effect?</P>
      <P>Once identified, adequate resources should be put in place to keep that child on a level playing pitch. However, as the House will be aware, the education system is far from being a level playing pitch. The likelihood is that those children who most need intervention and educational supports are those who are least likely to get them because the schools depend on significant fund-raising from the local parish and parents. It follows then that in areas where parents are badly off or are disadvantaged, money for schools simply is not there to fund the supplementary work of the schools which is so vital in all the other schools. Most schools could not imagine operating without that additional support from parents and the parish.</P>
      <P>There should be a requirement to track a child's progress throughout primary level. Information obtained through the tracking programme should move with the child through the secondary school system. Too often secondary school principals will say that children of 12 or 13 arrive with nothing more than a recommendation that he is a grand fellow or she is a lovely girl, a recommendation regarding the child's behaviour. This is often a major concern in areas of disadvantage. There is not an academic record travelling with a child from primary school to secondary school and often a child's literacy or numeracy problems are picked up only half way through first year in secondary school. This is unacceptable. It is doing a serious disservice to young people that they can get to that stage in their lives before their problems are detected. If there was regular screening in primary school and there was regular record-keeping, those records then could move with the child into secondary schools and appropriate programmes could be put in place, if necessary, from the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those children who drop out of the system, it is essential that they are not abandoned until their names turn up in the courts or in the home<Col N="968" /> less figures. Children who drop out of school early become non-persons: there are no school records for them, and because they are too young to enter the labour market they do not turn up on welfare or tax records. The State must accept responsibility to follow up on early school leavers, examine their reasons for leaving school and offer them new alternatives to learn and develop skills so that they may become fully integrated in the labour market during their adult lives.</P>
    <P>In too many cases the secondary schools are failing these young people who have literacy and numeracy problems. Often such children have behaviour problems also and the schools are only too happy to get rid of them. Part of the reason for this difficulty is that the problems are being detected at far too late a stage and the necessary supports are not available in the second level schools.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about the number of pilot projects in progress, particularly for early school drop-outs. I do not see why mainstream schools cannot cater for the vast majority of children attending there. Again it is a case of not targeting resources, adopting this scatter-gun approach where the Department gives a little to everybody. The Minister must provide the money to those areas which most need the resources. We have seen how successful that approach has been in Breaking the Cycle. That must be replicated in all areas of disadvantage and, in particular, at second level where it is possible to hold onto pupils who are exhibiting literacy or numeracy problems and who have behavioural problems. They need help when they are presenting with problems, not at a later point. Too often the Department of Education and Science and people involved in education such as teachers, administrators, etc., have been too keen to get rid of these troublesome students from the system.</P>
    <P>Once they are out of the system for a few years the likelihood is that they will end up in the care of the State one way or another. Of course it is no longer the problem of the Department of Education and Science. This attitude of passing the buck must change. We need long-term preventative work and an act of faith on the part of politicians and, in particular, the Government by investing in resources which will not necessarily yield dividends next year or in two or three years. After all, the education system is about long-term investment. That act of faith needs to be made by sitting politicians in terms of the allocation of resources to areas which will not necessarily yield results for many years.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 seek to incorporate in legislation, as a matter of form, a recommendation of an alternative or complementary community service sanction in order to remind courts that the option is there and should be availed of as a pragmatic solution in certain situations and as an alternative to prison or a fine. In too many cases judges have omitted the community service option as an alternative sanction. The Government has been particularly remiss in addressing this problem, both in the Attachment of Earnings Bill and in its failure to bring forward the Prison Service Bill.</P>
      <P>I fully support amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Howlin which proposes to reduce the penalty from a term not exceeding ten years to a term not exceeding five years. Deputy Howlin spoke of other Acts which deal with more serious situations than the one we deal with here, which is often a humanitarian gesture perhaps coupled with a few pounds, although no one wishes to see the commercial exploitation of asylum seekers. Deputy Howlin referred to the crime of soliciting a person to commit murder. I make a similar comparison with the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which imposes a sentence of ten years and a severe financial penalty for the possession of heroin. There is no comparison between the possession of heroin and trafficking in illegal immigrants. Someone who is guilty of the possession or sale of heroin is part of a conspiracy to bring about a mass human holocaust. We have seen the cost of this in the past two weeks in the number of people who have died in this city from the effects of contaminated heroin.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment in Deputy Howlin's name which proposes a reduction in the maximum sentence for trafficking in illegal immigrants from ten years to five. In some cases five years would be excessive. By imposing a maximum sentence of ten years the Minister is trying to send out the toughest possible message: that Ireland is a no-go area for asylum seekers or refugees from now on.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A common carrier shall not be deemed to have contravened <i>subsection (1) </i>solely by virtue of carrying a person who presents a document appearing to be a valid travel document or passport.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment allows a defence to travel companies who are shown what appears to be a valid passport or identification document. Such companies should not be required to carry out further checks at the risk of having a plane or vessel confiscated. The amendment would not protect drivers of private vehicles.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and I still find nonsensical the reply given by the Minister at that stage. He argued that the Bill does not cover carrier's liability, by which I assume he means United Kingdom-style strict liability where airlines must check for visas and so on. The Minister has promised to introduce carrier's liability legislation later on.</P>
      <P>Section 2 makes it an offence knowingly to facilitate the entry of a person who one has reasonable cause to believe is an illegal immigrant. My legal advice is that this could easily encompass airlines. Therefore the test of strict carrier's liability would not apply but an airline would be encompassed by this section. The amendment is required to ensure that does not happen.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will accept the need for some exemption on the lines proposed in this amendment to ensure that what is envisaged to be introduced &ndash; the introduction of a strict carrier's liability &ndash; is not introduced by this legislation through a back door. On reading of the Bill, there appears to be every danger of imposing such a burden on carriers. I would welcome the Minister of State's reasoning to assure me that this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Howlin that this is not a back door way of introducing another <Col N="971" /> issue. The Minister accepts the need to look at how carriers can be made more responsible for the passengers they bring here and it is his intention, after consultation with interested parties including carriers, to bring proposals to Government later this year for a range of measures to deal with that issue. It is a totally separate issue and another day's work. It has nothing to do with the matter before us. There is clearly no attempt to bring legislation in by the back door.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin's amendment is not relevant to the Bill as it appears to seek to limit the responsibility of a carrier to check the documentation of a passenger. No specific responsibility to check documents is provided in the Bill. I am aware that such legislation is in place in most European countries, such as the UK, and it imposes responsibility on carriers to check the documentation of passengers to ensure they have the necessary authorisation to enter the State. If passengers are landed and it transpires that they do not have the necessary documentation, the carrier can be automatically fined. The offences created are what are commonly called strict liability offences, that is, the carrier is automatically liable once a certain result occurs.</P>
      <P>No responsibility to check documents is created in the Bill and no strict liability offence is created. Before a trafficking offence is created by the Bill, the person must have intentionally given assistance to a person to come here whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe is an illegal immigrant or an asylum seeker. Accordingly, a person cannot be proceeded against simply because he or she was the carrier who brought the person here or simply because documentation is somehow lacking. The carrier can only be prosecuted if the necessary proof of intention exists. What is relevant is whether the carrier intentionally gave assistance and whether he or she knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the person was an illegal immigrant or an asylum seeker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the Minister of State's argument. I wish to take it a step further. Section 2(1) states:</P>
      <P>A person who organises or knowingly facilitates the entry into the State [that certainly could apply to an airline or ferry company] of a person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be an illegal immigrant . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us tease that out in terms of the assurances the Minister of State has just given us. How will that be proved? Let us take the example of a person who arrives wearing traditional Roma dress. The Minister of State said that, under the Bill or existing legislation, the carrier has no liability to check documentation. Surely it could be argued in a prosecution case that, in the case of a person wearing traditional Roma dress, there might be a suspicion or a reasonable cause to believe that the person might be an illegal immigrant or a per<Col N="972" /> son who intends to seek asylum. Why would this section not apply to carriers in that case? How can the Minister of State assure me that the letter of this provision, which seems to be clear, would not apply to carriers in the situation where a reasonable person would identify another person as someone who intends to seek asylum? It is easy to identify some of the people coming off the ferries in Rosslare. I can point out many of them long before they approach an immigration officer. How can the Minister of State assure me carriers will not be subject to this provision in those circumstances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is important is the distinction made. An airline such as Aer Lingus, which regularly carries passengers in and out of Dublin Airport, is in the business of carrying such passengers. A hackney driver who drives north of the Border to drive a car load of people into the South in the knowledge or with a reasonable belief that they are illegal immigrants or asylum seekers, and specifically does so for gain, is involved in the process and is not driving them in the normal course of his or her business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought. I will not speak too long. I understand that the Minister of State has come here without bringing the Bill through Committee Stage and so on but it is not good enough to deal in sloppy language. We need to have clarity in the Bill. It is clear to me that the example I gave could well be encompassed in the words written down that the Minister of State is asking us to enact, that is, a person who organises or knowingly facilitates the entry into the State of a person. Any carrier knowingly facilitates the entry of a person into the State. If somebody is aboard your airline or your boat, you are knowingly facilitating them into the State. That much is clear. A person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be somebody who intends to seek asylum &ndash; one could <i>prima facie</i> suggest that there is a likelihood that somebody who is in traditional Roma garb will seek asylum. A reasonable person would deduce that. If one spent a few weeks in Rosslare Harbour and saw somebody coming off the boat in Roma garb, one could bet a reasonable sum of money that will happen and a reasonable person would be entitled to make that deduction. One cannot argue that is not encompassed in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case then my amendment is necessary to ensure that one does not impose strict liability by the back door and for the avoidance of the penalties, which are extremely severe in the Minister's own words, falling on the carrier which is an airline company or a ferry company. They might well introduce stringent checks on the other side. If that is the Minister's intention, I invite her to be honest with the House and tell us but she should not pretend it is not her intention and that this means something that it clearly does not. It is clear in the reading of this that it could well have those implications for a carrier and a carrier would probably do well to be mindful of that potential if this measure is enacted unamended. It is important for us as legislators, and I do not mean this flippantly, to be clear in what we do and in our intention so that those <Col N="975" /> to whom the law applies understand their legal obligations.</P>
    <P>I have put a clear point to the Minister. She has talked about buses, taximen, hackneys and sailing but she has not answered the point I made. It is clear to me. I would yield to the Minister if she wanted to amplify it further but it is clear that the carriers could well be enmeshed in this provision as drafted. I have heard no cogent, coherent rebuttal of that contention from the Minister. That being the case, I appeal to her again to accept the amendment which makes it clear that a common carrier, which is an airline company or a ferry, could be exempted by simply accepting that a particular travel document presented is acceptable. It is not an argument against my amendment for the Minister to say that there is no strict imposition on a carrier to check documentation. That is clearly the case on the face of it, but there is a very clear responsibility on them to avoid being enmeshed in the provisions of section 2(1) with the consequences that are spelled out in section 2(1)<i>(a)</i> of a fine on summary conviction of £1,500 or 12 months imprisonment or both or on indictment, up to ten years imprisonment. Those are the bald facts and nothing the Minister has said has in any way allayed the fears I had or rebutted the contention I am putting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Mayo):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 46, to delete &ldquo;or could with reasonable diligence have discovered&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 4 which deals with the forfeiture of the vehicle whether it is a lorry, car, ship or plane where people knowingly facilitated the introduction of illegal immigrants <Col N="976" /> into the country. In a situation such as this, there is an obligation of due diligence excessively imposed on the owner.</P>
    <P>Section 4 states that where a person is convicted on indictment of an offence under section 2 and a vehicle was used by the person for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of the offence, the court concerned may, in addition to financial penalty or the jail sentence also confiscate the truck or the lorry. It then says in subsection (2) that this shall not apply to a person unless the person convicted is the owner, has a share in the vehicle concerned, is a director or a manager in the company or subject to subsection (3), the captain, driver or other person in charge of the vehicle concerned.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say in subsection (3) that &ldquo;where the person convicted is the captain, driver or other person in charge of the vehicle concerned, <i>subsection (1)</i> shall not apply unless the person referred to in <i>paragraph (a)</i> or <i>(b)</i> knew or could with reasonable diligence have discovered..&rdquo;  That is the problem &ndash; what constitutes reasonable diligence? Reasonable diligence is very subjective and not in my opinion alone, because we have been strongly lobbied by the Irish Road Hauliers' Association about it. They have major fears aabout the way this would operate. It depends on who will operate this law when it becomes part of the Statute Book. It is very subjective and obliges the owner effectively to exercise reasonable diligence and if they do not, they forfeit the truck, the carrier, the plane or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>If the owner is in Dublin, based in an office, looking after the company and the truck container is in Le Havre, how can an owner exercise reasonable diligence? The owner has to trust the driver of the truck to exercise reasonable diligence. How can somebody at a remove be penalised? This imposes an undue obligation on the owner. All one has to do is examine the nature of the traffic involved. The objections from the Irish Road Hauliers' Association centre around the type of traffic involved. One is talking about containerised traffic where a truck with the container leaves here, goes to its destination on the Continent, returns <i>via</i> Le Havre, Roscoff or Cherbourg or wherever it may be and works its way back into this country. The containers in some cases are not even part of the truck itself. One drops the container and picks up other containers and so on.</P>
    <P>One needs to examine the other restrictions relating to the use of vehicles such as restricted hours and tachographs relating to the number of hours a driver may safely be in charge of a vehicle with the result that they have to take time off. Knowing the nature of the people involved in the commercial exploitation of those trying to get into European countries, people can be quite easily exploited and the containers intercepted or penetrated by those who wish to hide away human cargo in such containers. To oblige an owner in Wexford, Mayo or Dublin to be subject <Col N="977" /> to the test of reasonable diligence for the work or management of the truck by a driver is most unfair and excessive. That is the reason I seek to delete the reasonable diligence provision.</P>
    <P>In a case where the person convicted is the captain, driver or other person in charge of the vehicle concerned, subsection (1) shall not apply unless the person referred to in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) knew &ndash; not knew or could have, with reasonable diligence, have discovered &ndash; that the vehicle was being used for the purpose of the commission of an offence under section 2. That is a genuine concern on the part of the road hauliers. They have genuine fears in the manner in which it will militate against them. They are genuinely fearful that for something which happens on their truck of which they are totally innocent and which is the work of somebody else &ndash; either the driver knew or, in some cases, did not know &ndash; they can be subject to the maximum penalty here which is an extremely punitive penalty, that is, the forfeiture of a truck worth £60,000 or £70,000. It is excessive and the Minister of State should look at it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Higgins's proposed amendment, I will further clarify what section 3(3) provides. Section 3 provides that where a person is convicted of an offence of trafficking, the vehicle used may be the subject of a forfeiture order by the court. This order may be in addition to or instead of any penalty imposed by the court under section 2. Subsection (3) provides that where the convicted person is the captain, driver or other person in charge of the vehicle, forfeiture will not be possible unless the owner, or where the owner is a company, a director or manager of that company, knew or could with reasonable diligence have discovered that the vehicle was being used for the purpose of the commission of the offence.</P>
      <P>If I were to accept this amendment, it would mean that the owner of a vehicle could turn a blind eye and effectively wash his or her hands of what might be going on but I assume that the Deputy is concerned that this reasonable diligence test might create strict liability or, at least, a high level of liability for the owners. This is not the case.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to the provision. First, it means by implication that the owner is expected to exercise a commonly accepted standard of care as would be expected of a person in the position of the owner. That is no more than what common sense would suggest should apply. Such reasonable care would have been taken if the owner established a proper system to guard against misuse of his property by traffickers and took reasonable steps to ensure that his or her business is operated in a responsible and bona fide manner. The second aspect of the provision is that if the trafficking is such that the exercise of reasonable vigilance could not have detected it, then the owner is not considered culpable and his or her vehicle cannot be forfeited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> This provision does not impose requirements on owners other than the requirements which common sense would say the responsible owner should in any event put in place. In other jurisdictions additional requirements have been placed on owners through carrier liability legislation or through strict liability legislation in respect of stowaways. As I already indicated in reply to Deputy Howlin, such matters are not provided for in this Bill but the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is considering whether such provisions should be a feature of our law and he hopes to bring suitable proposals in this respect to Government later this year after consultation with carriers, such as hauliers, shipping companies and airline companies.</P>
    <P>I am aware, as Deputy Higgins outlined, that the Irish Road Haulage Association has called for the introduction of a code of practice for its members. The Irish Road Hauliers Association is to be congratulated on its pro-active and responsible approach to this problem. As I indicated earlier, the introduction of a package of measures in relation to carrier responsibility for the passengers they bring to this country is under consideration. I assure Deputy Higgins that at that time the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, intends to consult carriers, including the Irish Road Haulage Association on his proposals in this respect. I hope that has been of assistance to the Deputy and I hope he will consider withdrawing his amendment.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am aware that other jurisdictions have carrier liability and strict liability provisions and that it is something which will be actively considered here. I, like the Minister of State, welcome the decision by the road hauliers to look for a code of practice. That is a very positive move and the Minister of State rightly welcomed it. From the point of view of the practicality of this, the Minister of State made a point on what constitutes reasonable diligence. She said we are talking about common sense and putting in place a proper system and reasonable checks. Maybe the Minister of State will give the House two or three examples of the kinds of checks about which she is talking.</P>
      <P>If, as is the norm, the headquarters of a company is located here, it operates from the continent of Europe and there is a considerable remove from the driver in question and the owners who are based here, what kind of reasonable checks are needed in order to bring about the required due diligence? What kind of proper system is the Minister of State talking about in order to meet the requirements of the legislation? Is she suggesting that the owner ring the truck driver on his mobile telephone before embarkation to ask him to check the container to see if he is carrying any illicit human cargo? What kind of checks is the Minister of State talking about? We are talking about the practicality of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really straightforward <Col N="979" /> common sense. If one has ten trucks travelling from France to Rosslare each week, one would go through a staff training process with the ten drivers, make sure there are locks on the vehicles, ensure regular checks are carried out on the vehicles by the drivers and one would go through the drill with them. If something occurs in France, despite all the training, the locks and instructions for regular checks and if one of the ten drivers decides to operate a different system and obtain gain from it, the manager cannot be held responsible for somebody else's deeds. The key is to ensure the owner does not turn a blind eye to the possibility of this happening and to ensure that the ten trucks are not carrying passengers each week. There is a distinction between a major operation and the manager turning a blind eye and a driver doing his own thing despite all the warnings, checks, inspections and training at the company.</P>

        <b>:</b> Would one of the expectations in applying reasonable or due diligence be, for example, that the owner of the truck in question would be expected to carry out spot checks here when the truck disembarks in Rosslare, Dublin Port or whichever port or terminal at which the truck arrives? According to the provisions of this section, would the company be expected to carry out checks on an on the spot or random basis? Are we talking about checks as distinct from the checks which would be carried out by the immigration officials and that checks would be carried out by owners on a random basis to see if their trucks were responsible for the infiltration or transportation of immigrants or asylum seekers from abroad?</P>

        <b>:</b> I wish to clear up one matter which arose earlier. The Minister of State hopped up indignantly when I attributed some statements to her on the question of immigration. I believe it is important that the issue should be clarified. On 14 October 1997 when speaking on the question of asylum seekers in the House she stated:</P>
      <P>At its core is the fact that for the most part this country is dealing not with a major influx of refugees but with a major influx of illegal immigrants . It must be noted that if one was to operate on the basis of international comparisons alone, one would expect that something of the order of 10 per cent, or less, of asylum seekers are granted refugee status at the end of the day. Even if we were to be generous and say that 25 per cent of our applicants would obtain such status, only about 900 persons for the Department's current case load would obtain asylum status.</P>

      <Col N="981" /> In page 6, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;(1)&rdquo; in line 29 down to and including &ldquo;1998,&rdquo; in line 46 and, in page 7, to delete lines 1 to 25.</P>
    <P>The main points I wish to make relate to amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14 and the attack in the legislation on the right of asylum seekers to judicial review. Section 5 is one of the most pernicious aspects of the legislation and there are quite a number of pernicious aspects to it. It is blatantly and quite shamelessly discriminatory in making a distinction in terms of human rights and rights before the law between citizens on the one hand and non-nationals on the other. Section 5(1) contains a raft of notifications, decisions and deportation orders, the validity of which may not be questioned other than by way of application for judicial review under Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.</P>
    <P>Before we move on to the question of the reduction in the time in which a case must be prepared for a judicial review application will the Minister of State explain what rights are taken away under section 5(1)? A range of notifications, decisions, etc., may not be appealed or questioned other than by way of application for judicial review. I want the Minister of State to outline the current position. What will change when section 5(1) is implemented? What methods can people currently avail of to question the validity of these orders and decisions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins rightly said, we are dealing with the contentious issue of judicial review encompassed by section 5. My amendment seeks in page 7 to insert &ldquo;or any lawful proceedings&rdquo; after &ldquo;order&rdquo;. Its purpose is to limit the outrageous suggestion that an asylum refusal can only be challenged by judicial review. As I have repeatedly said, this is a straitjacket on personal liberties and no such limit should apply. On Committee Stage I instanced an asylum seeker who is charged with a criminal offence because he is in the State illegally. As part of his defence against the criminal charge he contends and wants to prove that the deportation order was invalid. The State can say that it is sorry but under the provision of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, he can only challenge an order by judicial review, not by way of stating a case in a criminal trial. If the limiting factors which apply under this section come into play it could well be too late to state any defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an outrageous straitjacket and is probably unconstitutional. When I posited that scenario on Committee Stage on 30 March, the Minister stated &ldquo;If other procedures were to be engaged in, as suggested by the Deputy [myself], litigants would probably have to proceed by way of a cumbersome summons procedure&rdquo;. It ignores totally the possibility of raising the invalidity of a deportation order by way of defence in a trial and by doing so it greatly tramples on the rights of the individual to state his case in court. This section goes too far. The Minister, in his absolute desire <Col N="982" /> to straitjacket as far as it is possible the avenues of judicial challenge available to anybody in this State, seeks to put a unique limit on asylum seekers whose determination has been negative.</P>
    <P>We will certainly visit this issue again in later amendments. This is an important amendment. I hope the Minister has had a chance to reflect on the arguments made on Committee Stage, that they will be engaged more openly and that there will be an acknowledgement that we must row back on the impossible position put forward in this provision by the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <P>At least we are agreed on something. It would do so by having a special judicial review procedure which applied to no judicial review cases. It is clear that the generalised provision of the current order 84 of the rules of the superior courts, designed as they are to cater for the widest range of possible circumstances in which judicial review might be sought, do not rest well with the specific requirements of judicial review of immigration and asylum matters, where the delay occasioned by the court procedures can render nugatory the outcome of these proceedings. By that I mean that even though the actions of the Minister in making a particular decision may be vindicated by the court at the conclusion of the proceedings, including any appeal, the passage of time may make it impossible for the vindication decision to be followed up by the act of removing the person from the State. That is why the Minister has introduced these streamlining procedures, to ensure that court delay is kept to a minimum and will arise only where there are substantial grounds to justify such delay.</P>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Howlin's amendment would be to undo the streamlining and to invite parties to engage in procedures which are unspecified. That will introduce a lack of certainty and serve only to confuse litigants. The judicial review procedure is a well understood procedure, which is confirmed with the possibility of flaws by the decision maker in arriving at the decision being questioned. It is a satisfactory and sensible way of having the matter brought before the court with the optimum degree of expedition and the minimum of procedural burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government proposal does not affect in any way the<i> habeas corpus</i> jurisdiction of the High Court enshrined in Article 40.4 of the Constitution. No statute law can interfere with that or <Col N="983" /> modify it in any respect. If other procedures were to be engaged in by litigants on the basis of what is proposed by Deputy Howlin, litigants would probably have to proceed by way of a cumbersome summons procedure.</P>

      <P>The plenary summons procedure, for example, is a general purpose multi-stage procedure well suited to the general one of civil proceedings, where one party seeks to recover damages from another or assert rights as against another. It is not, however, a particularly expeditious one. Proceedings by way of special, or for that matter, summary summons are special forms of the general procedure. The summary summons process is designed primarily for the recovery of debt and the special summons process relates mainly to the accession of various forms of property rights. I see no advantage for the administration of justice generally, or for the attainment of justice in particular cases, in providing for a proliferation of different procedures whereby the validity of any of the steps listed in the Government proposal might be put in issue.</P>
      <P>The judicial review procedure, in particular with the adaptations which section 5 have put in place, is not merely sufficient to enable the rights of the matter to be determined and to be determined expeditiously, it is the procedure most suited to achieving those aims. The directions remain for the High Court in suitable cases to direct that the proceedings initiated through the direct and expeditious judicial review channel should proceed using the plenary summons process. The various procedural aids to achieve justice, such as interrogations for clarifying precisely what matters are at issue and the discovery of documents so that both sides are fully aware of the facts, are equally available in the proceedings by way of judicial review as in the plenary summons procedure.</P>
      <P>Nothing of benefit will be added by the acceptance of Deputy Howlin's amendment, but much could be lost by allowing a climate of procedural uncertainty, a situation which section 5 is directed at avoiding. That said, I am prepared to look at the specific point raised by the Deputy as to the question of the use of a challenge to the validity of the order as a defence in criminal proceedings. I will consult with the Attorney General on that specific question. I thank Deputy Joe Higgins for clarifying what I said in October 1997, as distinct from the assertions he made earlier, when he misquoted me.</P>

        <b>:</b> The response of the Minister of State is appalling. In essence, the Government is saying that we should allow applicants for asylum the same rights as Irish citizens in their recourse to the law in case they might not be successful in the application they make, in which case much time would have been lost in the business of throwing them out of the country. This approach is predicated on the general attitude of the Government, which is that 90% of applicants will be found not to have a genuine case for asylum. The Bill is a logical follow on to the Government's general approach to asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If enacted, the Bill will run into serious constitutional problems. It will be before the highest courts within a short period. Section 5 is contrary to Article 40 of the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the courts. Article 40.1 states: &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  The advice to us from senior barristers is that this is applied by the courts in the same way to non-nationals, and this principle has been operated by the courts for perhaps the past two decades. The Minister should, therefore, be clear that the Government would be in breach of this Article as it has been applied for almost <Col N="985" /> the past 20 years. I will have more to say on this when we deal with the right to judicial review, which is implied in the cutback to 14 days on the time limit in which people may make an appeal. It is a bad day's work by the Government to introduce this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked at the response of the Minister of State. Basically she defends what is in the Bill by saying that the amendment I propose would introduce procedural uncertainty. What procedural uncertainty is she talking about? Is it that non-nationals would have the same access to the courts and the same rights of appeal as any other citizen? Is she concerned with this to such an extent that she proposes to have unique straitjacket procedures applied to asylum seekers which do not apply to others? It is outrageous, particularly when the Minister of State has responsibility for equality matters and the Department of Equality and Law Reform has been subsumed into the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I welcome the revisiting of the clear anomaly that I pointed out on Committee Stage regarding the danger of a constitutional challenge to the measure that will circumscribe people's right to state a defence in a criminal case. The Minister of State said the measure will be revisited and I presume that will be before the Bill goes to the other House. If it stood, undoubtedly, it would be infirm by constitutional standards.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that no statute law can interfere with <i>habeas corpus</i>. However, no exception to that end is implicit in the Bill. While no statute can infringe the Constitution, the right of <i>habeas corpus</i> should be spelled out. Undoubtedly, the Minister of State will say that constitutional rights are there <i>simpliciter </i>and do not need to be spelled out in any enactment.</P>
      <P>My points relate, first, to the constitutional infirmity of the provision and how that will be addressed &ndash; it can only be addressed by acceptance of the amendment &ndash; and, second, the position regarding <i>habeas corpus</i> and spelling out the rights contained in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The Bill states that an order can only be challenged by judicial review. This runs foul of the Constitution; it makes the measure constitutionally infirm. The Minister of State did <Col N="986" /> not respond. This is becoming frustrating because I made a number of contributions. It is a negative way of dealing with the Bill. None of my points have been answered.</P>
      <P>I pointed out two areas where this provision is unconstitutional. The Bill states that a deportation order can only be challenged by judicial review. The Minister of State cannot suggest that we know it can be challenged by order of <i>habeas corpus</i> because that is contained in the Constitution. That is not the way it works. The Bill states that the only way an order can be challenged is by judicial review. Clearly, that is unconstitutional. If somebody challenges it, it will be found to be infirm. Will the Minister of State's defence in a constitutional challenge be that the Government always recognised the other measure was there as well. It seeks to deny people their constitutional rights by saying an order can only be challenged by judicial review. This is wrong and it is vulnerable to judicial review, although perhaps that is no harm.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State did not respond to my point about how the clear constitutional right to put up a legal defence in a criminal case will be met other than through the acceptance of my amendment, which states &ldquo;after &lsquo;Order'), to insert &lsquo;or any other lawful proceedings' &rdquo;. The Minister of State should revisit this matter. I believe these are the only words the Attorney General will advise to make the provision constitutional. One cannot circumscribe people's rights to access as proposed in the provision.</P>
      <P>I have made these points twice but the Minister of State did not respond. One will be revisited, but rejected in the House, while the other has been ignored. The Constitution states that <i>habeas corpus</i> is the prerogative of the High Court and that is that. However, the Bill states that it will not apply and that only judicial review will apply. This strikes against the constitutional provision which the Minister of State said cannot be struck against. Surely this makes the measure infirm.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult debating system. I have made points but they have been ignored. It is frustrating trying to argue points at this stage. The provisions are badly thought out, constitutionally infirm and subject to being struck down. I appeal to the Minister of State to remedy that position by rowing back a little through the acceptance of my amendment, which states &ldquo;any other lawful proceedings&rdquo;. This would ensure that the normal avenues of legal redress that are open to everybody under the Constitution are available to non-nationals seeking to challenge deportation orders made by the Minister.</P>

      <P>We will continue to rehearse the arguments just as we did in relation to amendment No. 1 on Committee Stage. These are the two core issues in the second and third instalments of the Bill. We had the initial Bill and then we had this amendment by the Minister which sent shock waves not only through the political profession but through the legal profession and the various organisations which represent immigrants and asylum seekers. This is fundamentally wrong, as Deputy Joe Higgins and Deputy Howlin said. The Minister will rue this day because as sure as the Minister of State is sitting there with her advisers in train, this Bill will be taken to court. People know it is unconstitutional. It is beyond me why the Minister of State would invite a court challenge by introducing this.</P>
      <P>We support reasonable measures to curtail illegal trafficking in human misery which brings people into the country for commercial exploitation purposes only for them to be shown the red card. However, we want the people brought in to at least be allowed equality of access to due process in the same way as anyone living here. That has already been decided in the Constitution and in its interpretation. Mr. Justice Barrington has already made it clear in a judgment that anyone from outside the jurisdiction has exactly the same protection in terms of their constitutional right of access to the courts as an Irish citizen. I do not know how, if or in what circumstances the Attorney General could offer advice which would invite a constitutional challenge. No sooner will this Bill have passed both Houses than it will be tested in the courts. It is as obvious as day follows night that it will be found constitutionally defective.</P>
      <P>This is legal apartheid, racism and blatant discrimination. It is beyond me why a certain category of people, particularly vulnerable people coming into the country, should be singled out for restricted access to the courts. My amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;14 days&rdquo;, which was introduced by the Minister, and substitute the original &ldquo;3 months&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, does not like to be reminded that last January his independent appeals commissioner, Mr. Peter Finlay, walked out because he could not take any more. He said that as far as he was concerned he could not stand over procedures which were farcical. <Col N="988" /> When someone who has been cloistered in the inner sanctum of the Department and has been appointed to arbitrate in the procedures used decides he cannot take any more because of the manner in which the rules are being applied by the Department and the expectation on him to apply the rules in a certain way, surely it is time to reflect. We asked the Minister on Committee Stage to reflect on the fact that someone in whom he invested the supreme power of making the final decision on whether someone is entitled to asylum decided in sheer frustration that he had no option but to walk out on the man who appointed him and his Department. That was a watershed decision.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that Mr. Finlay is an eminent lawyer and a man of sound and balanced judgment. He has had a long legal career and has distinguished himself at the Bar. He is also recognised as an expert on human rights. Yet his damning denunciation of the procedures used was that he could not stand over them because they were indefensible and farcical. He decided not to give any interviews but to go back to legal practice. He then volunteered to go before the joint committee and to make an oral presentation on the procedures which he felt were lamentable, inoperable, uninspired and ill-considered. That is the view of someone who saw at close quarters the way the system operated.</P>
    <P>This was the final straw. Not only could the appeals commissioner not stand over the existing procedures but the new regime being introduced which denies someone the fundamental constitutional right to the proper time to prepare a case, apart from their constitutional entitlement, compelled him to come before the committee to offer his opinion. He offered it not only from the point of view of it being unconstitutional but also from the point of view of it being practical. As a practising lawyer who deals on a daily basis with cases for judicial review, he felt it was totally impractical and inoperable that anyone could present anything other than a substantial case in order to be entertained in the courts. One does not get to court unless there is a substantial case to present.</P>
    <P>The fact that an eminent person such as Mr. Finlay, who has expertise, experience and knowledge and is sensitive, caring and concerned came voluntarily before the committee and offered his opinion in such a forthright fashion should have made the Minister pull back and reflect on the fact he could not continue because if lawyers were thinking in such terms, they were guaranteed to act as soon as the Bill was on the Statute Book. Mr. Finlay said the procedures were impractical, inoperable, lamentable and unconstitutional. What more does the Minister want in terms of clear evidence of the lack of wisdom, apart from the foolhardiness, of following this route?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important part of the section which we visited on Committee Stage. I <Col N="989" /> will rehearse the arguments put forward then because my argument has not changed and I want to revisit some of what the Minister said. It is just as well the Minister is not here because he gets upset when Deputy Jim Higgins quotes the former appeals commissioner. It aggravates him to have the truth spelled out in such graphic detail.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 seeks to delete the 14 days provision for the application for judicial review and to insert &ldquo;6 months&rdquo;. On Committee Stage the Minister claimed that the existing time limit is three months. I am reliably informed that is an error and that it is six months for an application to quash a decision. The Minister said it is nonsensical to give six months when a person can be deported in 14 days. A number of answers can be made to that point. The Minister's argument only applies to section 5(1)(<i>c</i>) which is that a deportation order should be implemented within14 days and not other orders that arise in the sequencing of processes that are available to asylum seekers. In the event, he cannot guarantee that all deportation orders will take place and be executed within 14 days, especially as the Minister of State was at pains to point out that we must get the people back to the right country and not go through any other EU country which, to use her words, would be unfair. I am not sure it will be so efficient as to get everyone back to their home country in the 14 days the Minister allows. More importantly is that the general law that applies to every citizen allows six months to challenge a decision even if that decision has immediate effect let alone 14 days. It is a nonsense to say that a provision that has six months implicit in it for decisions that have immediate effect means that a provision that has 14 days to execute itself should not have a similar time frame.</P>
      <P>We are not saying that the asylum process must stop for six months but unless a person is deported earlier the normal period that applies to every citizen to apply to the courts to quash a decision should be available to people who are subject to these orders. Both Deputy Joe Higgins and Deputy Jim Higgins argued beyond dispute that the Supreme Court holds that the same rights are available to non-nationals as to citizens. We cannot say that administrative decisions that have an effect on someone &ndash; a citizen would be entitled to six months to seek judicial review &ndash; should not and must not apply to somebody else. Six months is the normal period within which to seek judicial review to quash a decision. If anything, it could be argued that a more favourable regime should apply to asylum seekers because of all the particular difficulties that arise with language, cultural understanding, legal explanation and so on. To try to circumscribe that to a 14 day period is wrong and will not survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A spokesman for the Minister is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying this measure is to stop vexatious appeals. The Minister told the committee, as Members will recall, that he never said such a thing. I presume he has written to <i>The Irish Times</i> seeking a retraction or at least admonished the <Col N="990" /> spokesperson because it is an outrageous suggestion to leave unchallenged. What the Minister is alleged to have said is that there are people applying to the courts and they are entertaining vexatious appeals. Is it the assertion that judges are acting too leniently? Are judges being fooled because they must give leave? Is that the Minister's argument or is he seeking to interfere in the courts by presenting that people are bringing arguable cases to the court? In any event, this circumscribing of the time frame for the right of appeal is wrong and probably unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the Minister of State's response to amendment No. 14. I tabled it after a little reflection and it might surprise us and find favour with the Minister. It is a new amendment that will allow a person to bring one judicial review at the last stage of the process. Under the Minister's amendment there will be an invitation to bring a judicial review within 14 days of each decision at every step of the process. This will happen because the time frame is so tight that there will be an inclination to do so. My amendment will allow the judicial review process, which is an examination by a judge of due process, to take place at the end as is right and proper.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 is the more important one. If the Minister is serious about deporting people within 14 days, well and good, but he will not get away with circumscribing their rights to a 14 day period. That will not stand a constitutional challenge. Since he believes they will be deported in jig time, where is the difficulty in allowing the normal procedures of appeal for those who are in the country and in a position to exercise that right?</P>
    <P>All the arguments have been well ventilated and I hope, to use a much hackneyed phrase, on mature reflection the Minister will relent and allow this amendment to be enacted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> This is one of the worst aspects of the Bill. It is pernicious and an attack on human rights and human beings. It shows up a Government that has scant regard for human rights as they relate to people on this island and those seeking the protection of this island in their plight. We objected on a number of occasions to material brought in under the Bill which had nothing to do with illegal trafficking. That is the position as regards the right to judicial review. The Government's proposal to limit to 14 days the time within which a person notified of a deportation decision can make an application for a judicial review is an attack on their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases the Government has piggybacked on previous legislation regarding elements relating to immigration law as a result of disorganisation and because it does not have a cohesive immigrant policy. However, there is another reason it chose to bring in this proposal. It is a sleight of hand by the Minister and the Government. It is very significant that it is being introduced in this Bill as lawyers who have briefed var<Col N="991" /> ious Deputies and parties have pointed out. It is clearly the case that if the Government wished to make proposals in this regard, it should have done so under the Refugee Act, 1996. There is a clear reason that did not happen. It was an implicit admission that if it was introduced into other legislation, particularly the Refugee Act, 1996, it would not stand up in law. It is clearly laid down in legal matters in this State that any statutory restriction on the exercise of the right of judicial review must be interpreted in the context of the object and purpose of the Act wherein it is contained. The Long Title of the Refugee Act, 1996, states that it is an &ldquo;Act to give effect to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on the 28th day of July, 1951, the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on the 31st day of January, 1967,&rdquo; and other international agreements. In the context of those international agreements and international practice with regard to refugees, this proposal would not stand up because it represents an attack on fundamental rights and represents the making of a clear and invidious distinction between citizens of this State and non-nationals seeking refuge here as they stand before the law.</P>
    <P>Article 16 of the Geneva Convention 1951 on the Status of Refugees, which is included as a Schedule to the Refugee Act, 1996, states that &ldquo;a refugee shall enjoy in the Contracting State in which he has his habitual residence the same treatment as a national in matters pertaining to access to the Courts&rdquo;. It is also common practice, accepted by the bodies which deal with refugees internationally, that asylum seekers must enjoy the same presumption as refugees and, therefore, must enjoy the same rights in front of the law as accorded to refugees. Therefore, it is clear that the sleight of hand in this legislation was not possible in the 1996 Act because it would be an attack on the rights of asylum seekers and could not be included in a Bill which purported to give some measure of protection to asylum seekers. The only way the Government could find to introduce it was through legislation which deals in criminal trafficking. We have already made the point of how prejudicial it is to the rights of innocent people that matters relating to their rights in this State should be included in legislation related to criminal trafficking.</P>
    <P>Lawyers who appeared before the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights dealt with this in some detail. On the question of frivolous and vexatious cases being brought for judicial review, it was pointed out that 30 cases had come for judicial review until a month ago. Far from being frivolous or vexatious, the Minister won only one of those cases and either settled or lost all of the others. There is no evidence from the High Court that frivolous and vexatious cases were being brought by people seeking to remain in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The real scandal about this legislation is the <Col N="992" /> chasm it opens up between the rights accorded to citizens of this State and to those applying for asylum. That is shameful when one considers that these are poor, vulnerable people who have had to uproot themselves from their homes and cultures, as Irish people had to do in their millions. When they come here they find a Government going to extreme measures to cut down on their rights. This legislation will end up before the courts because of that and the Minister will have a very rough ride.</P>
    <P>By reducing the time to 15 days with the proviso that, in effect, a substantial case is made within that period of time, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State will create severe practical difficulties for those who will be called upon in the courts to represent asylum seekers seeking a judicial review. The High Court may not grant the right to judicial review unless it is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision, determination, recommendation, refusal or order is invalid or ought to be quashed. If it is a requirement on the High Court that it should refuse such an application except when there are substantial grounds, then the substantial case will, effectively, have to be argued at the point of application for judicial review. That is clearly the case.</P>
    <P>What effect will that have? If the Minister is trying to frog march people seeking judicial review, he will find this will have the opposite effect. Normally the process for seeking a judicial review does not take a long time. A basic case is laid out and on that a judge makes a decision to hold a hearing of the substantive grounds of the case at a later stage. If the judge has to be satisfied that there are substantial grounds for an appeal, the barristers representing the asylum seekers will have to make the substantial case at that point.</P>
    <P>This will cause mayhem in the courts because, instead of the ten minutes an application for the right to a judicial review takes up, there will be cases that will run into hours. The barristers and solicitors representing the asylum seeker seeking a judicial review will have an obligation to make the case substantially at that point because so much will depend upon it. This is a serious attack on civil rights. How will the barristers and solicitors, who have a heavy case load in many instances, be able to prepare a substantial case in 14 days? There will be extraordinary difficulties, difficulties that will not be faced by Irish citizens. Deputy Howlin mentioned the language barrier &ndash; it can be a severe impediment. The rights of those with extra difficulties are being attacked in comparison with the rights accorded to Irish citizens in the time allowed for a judicial review.</P>
    <P>The denial of an appeal to the Supreme Court is a further attack on civil rights and a further exacerbation of the distinction the Government is attempting to make between non-nationals in this State seeking justice before the law and citizens of the State. It is only under the planning <Col N="993" /> Acts &ndash; this may apply in one or two other exceptional cases &ndash; that the period in which judicial review applications must be made has been foreshortened. In the case of the Planning Act, 1993, it is foreshortened to a two month period. The planning Acts deal with matters involving land, property, etc., but we are discussing human beings, human rights and people who face deportation to, in many instances, extremely difficult circumstances in their countries of origin. However, the period in which an application for a judicial review must be made under the Bill is foreshortened to 14 days. That is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>Most of those who will be affected by the legislation, if passed, are poor people without means. These individuals will require legal aid. Anyone who knows anything about the free legal aid system, will be aware that this will place intolerable pressure on the Legal Aid Board. In my opinion these people's rights will again be severely compromised because lawyers will be forced or pressurised into preparing cases. As part of their code, lawyers stress that they will not present cases unless they are sure that they will have ample time in which to prepare and present them properly. If the legislation is passed, I foresee a situation where lawyers will be obliged to go before judges and state that they could not prepare cases for judicial review applications within the 14 day period. Under a further provision in the Bill, judges will be obliged to consider this as a good and sufficient reason for extending the period within which the application shall be made. That provision is self-defeating.</P>
    <P>We are faced here with the inclusion in legislation of provisions which are inimical to civil and human rights and which are a disgrace to this country, particularly in terms of the way it treats non-national poor people. In many instances those provisions might prove unworkable in practice.

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>These proposals are being inserted in the Bill in line with the procedures established by the Dáil. The advice from the <Col N="994" /> Attorney General's office is that it is a suitable legislative instrument in which to do so. I see no argument in law or logic which states that a provision inserted in one item of legislation would be offensive to our obligations to refugees and asylum seekers under the 1951 Geneva Convention but that, as Deputy Joe Higgins argued, the same provision inserted in another instrument somehow circumvents this obligation.</P>
      <P>The Government would not bring forward a proposal unless satisfied that it was in line with the Constitution and our obligations under international law. As if that were not enough, the argument made by Deputy Joe Higgins blithely makes the assumption that the judicial review proposals are directed exclusively at the asylum process. It does not take a practised legal mind to recognise, from a casual glance at the list of decisions, orders and other administrative steps comprehended by section 5(1) that asylum matters form only part of the remit of the provision.</P>
      <P>All of the issues debated here this evening were discussed at length on Committee Stage. As I stated in respect of the previous amendment, the purpose of the Government proposal is to provide a judicial review procedure which is tailored to the particular requirements of the matters in issue in the areas of immigration and asylum. An important aspect of that specific adaptation to those requirements is the incorporation of realistic time limits which are related to those applying to the decisions, orders and other steps listed at section (5)(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>n</i>).</P>
      <P>It has not yet been satisfactorily explained why, in circumstances where an order, if unchallenged, will be executed within 14 days, the law should nonetheless allow a period of three months &ndash; or even more illogically, in the case of Deputy Joe Higgins' and Howlin's amendment, six months&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputies are asking the House to accept that, notwithstanding the fact that there are time limits of two and three weeks built into the legislation governing the various steps covered under subsection (1) of the Government proposal, the law should, in effect, say, &ldquo;Don't mind those time limits at all; you have loads of time within which you can take a case to the High Court challenging the validity of the decision or order.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>The logic of such a provision is that there should be a three month gap between each step in the asylum process in which the staff of the Department, or, as soon will be the case, the staff of the Refugee Applications Commission and the Refugee Appeal Tribunal, give the applicant the full entitlement of time to question the validity of the process so far in the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to follow the logic of amendment No. 13, any person refused leave to land in the State would nonetheless have to be allowed to remain in the State for six months in case they wished to challenge the validity of the refusal. Each step in the deportation process would have to be followed by a long interval to give the potential deportee the opportunity to avail of the period provided by law for the taking of judicial review proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no way to operate. In the immigration context, the Deputies' proposals would, if I might put it this way, introduce an open door through the back door.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the three month limit &ndash; in some cases, as Deputy Howlin stated, it is six months &ndash; provided for in the Rules of the Superior Courts is in many cases more theoretical than real. The requirement of promptness of action is the first requirement set out in the rules, at Order 84, Rule 21, paragraph (1). That requirement overrides, in practice, any time limits which the rules may set or which may be set in this Bill. If I, as a person involved in an administrative procedure with some organ of the State, am not happy that a step in that procedure was carried out properly in accordance with law or principle, the onus is on me to act promptly before any subsequent step is taken on foot of the one with which I take issue. Otherwise, the court will simply throw me out.</P>
      <P>What the Government proposal does, in setting the limit at 14 days, is to reflect the real world. The limits which the Deputies' amendments seek to insert are all very fine in the general circumstances which Order 84 of the rules of the court must cater for but, in the areas of immigration and asylum to which the Government proposal is designed to apply, they are patently out of kilter with reality. There is no point in incorporating a theoretical, unreal and unworkable time limit in the Government's proposal. To do so would only cause confusion because of the obvious conflict between that limit and those set in the various provisions listed in subsection (1) of the Government proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy Howlin, I have already spoken of the need for a <Col N="996" /> person to act promptly in relation to a particular step in an administrative process to which objection is taken to the effect that it was not properly carried out. Let us take, for example, the case of a person who has applied for asylum and whose application is being investigated under the Refugee Act by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. I, as an asylum applicant, may find myself unable to turn up for interview because I am ill in hospital and, notwithstanding my explanation to the Refugee Applications Commissioner, another date may be fixed on which I still cannot attend for the same reason. If the commissioner then proceeds to find that my application was manifestly unfounded on the basis that I obstructed the application or did not offer sufficient evidence to back up my application, in spite of my producing medical evidence of my inability to attend for interview, then the correct remedy for this breach of proper procedure and of the provisions of the Act is immediate judicial review. It is not right that I should have to wait to see how my appeal against the commissioner's decision is determined by the appeals tribunal because it is a procedural flaw of which I am critical, not something which goes to the substance of the case.</P>
    <P>In such a case as I have outlined, of course, there would be such an obvious breach of procedure that the very mention of the words &ldquo;judicial review&rdquo; would prompt corrective action on the commissioner's part but, if not, then it would be proper to commence the proceedings in order to rectify the error. Of course, there are other circumstances in which the line between what is properly a matter to be settled in the normal way at the next stage of the process on the one hand, and what, on the other hand, should be the subject of judicial review proceedings is more blurred. I have no desire to encourage a proliferation of judicial review proceedings at every hand's turn; quite the contrary. That is an issue this debate has failed to address.</P>

      <P>It is clear that it is better that prompt action be taken the moment a procedural error becomes apparent than to wait until a series of subsequent steps are taken before raising the procedural point. Promptness of action is critical.</P>
      <P>The Minister is supported in this view by the awareness that the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction to defer consideration of a judicial review matter in suitable cases to allow the administrative process to proceed on the basis that at the end of the administrative process there may no longer remain an issue which depends on the outcome of the judicial review proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be, once again in suitable cases, that the court may exercise the discretion provided at section 5(2)(<i>a</i>) to extend the time beyond 14 days for the making of an application for judicial review in a situation such as that for which the <Col N="997" /> Deputies are seeking to provide in this amendments.</P>
    <P>In all, I am satisfied that the requirement for prompt invocation of the court's jurisdiction outweighs any advantage that might arise in a limited number of cases from the Deputy's amendment and that the court has the discretion and common sense to ensure, in the right cases, that the applicant for judicial review will not be disadvantaged by pursuing the judicial review route as against following the normal immigration or asylum related processes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The future of the surgical wing of Bantry general hospital and the future of Bantry Hospital in general is an important matter.</P>
      <P>Is it true the future of surgical services in the hospital might be in danger? Will the Minister give a categorical assurance to the House and to me that surgical services will continue in Bantry General Hospital because rumours to the contrary have been circulating widely throughout the length and breadth of west Cork and south Kerry? Will the Minister explain why a second surgeon's position has been left vacant for the past 12 years since the former surgeon, Mr. Baker, retired 12 years ago? Will the Minister explain why a second anaesthetist's position has been left vacant for the same 12 year period?</P>
      <P>I understand that Comhairle na n-Ospidéal has a recognised policy that all surgical hospitals should have the services of two surgeons and two anaesthetists. Will the Minister explain why the two positions in Bantry General Hospital have not been filled for those past 12 years? Will he authorise the filling of the those two vacant positions immediately?</P>
      <P>I need not remind the Minister of the importance of Bantry General Hospital to the vast hinterland of west Cork and south Kerry, embracing a sprawling area from Courtmacsherry in the east to Waterville in County Kerry. The Minister is familiar with the vast terrain that makes up my constituency of Cork South West and South Kerry, the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, who also depends on the services of this hospital for the people of his area.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to give me a categorical assurance that the surgical services in Bantry General Hospital will continue and that the two positions will be filled. I urge the Minister to record his intention to take immediate steps to fill those two positions, thereby securing the surgical department of this hospital. I do not want Bantry General Hospital downgraded to a geriatric unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area is so large that patients could die in transit to University Hospital in Cork. Parts of <Col N="1000" /> my constituency in the Beara peninsula are 125 miles from Cork city. The Mizen peninsula, where I live myself, is almost 100 miles from Cork city and the Muintir Bháire peninsula likewise. It is of paramount importance that the surgical wing in Bantry General Hospital is retained. I urge the Minister to give me that assurance.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter more than 12 months ago I was given an assurance by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, that there was not a proposal to discontinue general surgical services at Bantry General Hospital. I hope the Minister will reassure me of that tonight. Dr. Moffatt also told me on that occasion that the future role of surgery will be explored in the context of the plan being prepared by the Southern Health Board. That is a devious plan. I have no faith it that plan and I want the Minister to assure the House that Bantry Hospital will continue to serve the areas of south west Cork and south Kerry with a surgical service and that he will appoint a second surgeon, two consultants and two anaesthetists to the hospital immediately.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take &ldquo;No&rdquo; for an answer. Actions speak louder than words. I do not want the people of my constituency to live in fear of their hospital closing down. The University Hospital in Cork is bursting at the seams, with patients from my constituency spending two days on trolleys while they wait for beds. Down in Bantry we have an excellent hospital with excellent facilities which cannot function adequately for the want of staff. Where is the Celtic tiger? The Government has millions to squander all over the country but the Minister ignores the fact that south west Cork needs facilities. The future of Bantry Hospital as a major surgical unit must be assured.</P>
    <P>I have been told the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was successful in having Naas County Hospital maintained recently.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, Senator O'Donovan and the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, have been in touch with me about the mysterious development of a rumour regarding the future of Bantry General Hospital.

I give the Deputy and my colleagues that categorical assurance on the record of the House. I am intrigued by the manner in which the rumour has developed and circulated.</P>
      <P>Bantry General Hospital plays a very important role in the provision of hospital services to the people of west Cork. In that context, I am familiar with the vast terrain the Deputy and his colleagues cover. I am a frequent admirer of the tenacity of west Cork public representatives because they cover vast territory. It can be arduous and they cover long distances. It is probably one of the most difficult constituencies in the country to cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent my holidays there in the beautiful countryside. The provision of services at the hospital is the statutory provision of the Southern Health Board. In considering the future role of Bantry General Hospital, the board propose to take a phased approach to the development of the hospital. The starting point is the existing services and a process of upgrading these is required. This process will involve a site appraisal to be undertaken to identify capital implications, including the upgrading of ward and single room accommodation for patients; address immediate staff requirements to ensure that the existing level of service can continue; invest in new equipment on a phased basis; commence the appointment of a replacement consultant physician and seek approval for a new second post of consultant physician with a special interest in medicine for the elderly. This is extremely important given the demographic changes taking place throughout the country and the need for greater services for the elderly in our community.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to working with the Southern Health Board to build on the strengths of the hospital in meeting the needs of the local population. The Southern Health Board has carried out a needs assessment of services at Bantry General Hospital and has commenced the process of developing services there on a phased basis to continue to meet the needs of the people of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make clear that there are no proposals to discontinue surgical services at Bantry General Hospital. The provision of surgical services at the hospital is the subject of ongoing consultation, discussion and review. A complete review of the surgical case mix is being undertaken and the professor of surgery and the two accident and emergency consultants at Cork University Hospital are involved in the discussion of various options. These discussions are taking place in the context <Col N="1002" /> of extensive consultations with all interested parties, notably local general practitioners. The consultant surgeon post is single handed at present, and there are no proposals to reduce this service. I will consider any proposals that the board may put forward in the light of these discussions with a view to ensuring that the services to patients at Bantry General Hospital are developed in line with the principles of best practice in this area.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the management of the Southern Health Board is examining, with the assistance of Comhairle na nOspidéal, the consultant medical staff of the board and with my Department, the possibilities for the development of surgical services, including the possibility of applying for the appointment of a second surgeon at Bantry General Hospital. Rather than any reduction, we are looking at expansion in these areas.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy of my absolute commitment to the development of services in the Southern Health Board area, including those at Bantry General Hospital. I am confident the hospital will continue to play a full and active role in the provision of high quality surgical services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for affording me the facility of raising this important issue. I compliment the Minister for being present to take this debate. He has shown by his interest in similar debates in the past that he has sufficient interest in his brief to follow through. I compliment him for being here. Not all his colleagues take the same interest and that is something which should be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>My matter refers to Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994: Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. The criteria laid down under that heading cause problems for people who have serious disabilities in the form of a major lack of use of a limb or both limbs which means they are unable to drive an ordinary car and which makes it impossible for them to go to work or study or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's officials kindly contacted me recently to discuss the issue with me and I recognise the limited and peripheral role his Department plays. However, it has an influential role. <Col N="1003" /> The Department of Finance states that it has no responsibility in the matter other than through the Revenue Commissioners in that the statutory instrument is drawn up by Revenue and it operates accordingly. The health boards operate the regulations.</P>
    <P>I have countless constituents, as I am sure every Member has in the current economic climate, calling for a liberalisation in this area. I know an interdepartmental review group is meeting on the matter and that it is open to taking submissions from the public and, I presume, Members of the Oireachtas. I made a submission in February or March and never received a reply. I assume the submission has been taken into account.</P>
    <P>The problem is that, to qualify, a person is required to have complete lack of use or loss of one or both limbs. The wording must be changed to &ldquo;substantial loss of use&rdquo;. Such a person as I have referred to earlier is not eligible for a driver's licence because driving testers would deem them to be unsafe on the road. At the same time, such a person will not qualify for the special concessions because of the criteria laid down in the regulations. They are in a catch-22. I have a number of constituents who are disabled passengers whose drivers will not qualify for the tax concessions, despite the fact that these constituents must be driven to work or study and driven home at night. That is something which no one else can provide. No public transport can do that for them because they need supervision. I also have a number of constituents who are capable of driving themselves in a specially adapted car. However, the phrase in the regulations states that they must be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both limbs. That is ridiculous. Nothing can happen while that phrase exists in the regulations.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister use his influence with the review group to get it to focus its attention on the impossible situation in which we now find ourselves and to recognise the problems of people with a disability who want to but cannot go to work under their own steam and who need the facility of a specially adapted car? Admittedly they can do this if they pay for it themselves but I see no reason that that should be imposed on them. Having a disability where one suffers the substantial loss of use of one or both limbs is a serious problem and should be seen as such. We should help and encourage such people in every way we can. Will the Minister use his influence with the review group to bring about the changes I suggest? If that were done, the people concerned would qualify. I see no reason that should not be done. In poorer times when we did not have the resources, it might have been necessary to be stricter in the application of rules but, at present, there is no excuse for it. Will the Minister, as a compassionate and caring person, pursue the issue with the review group because I do not believe it will happen unless he does?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. Most Deputies would be aware of the issues raised regarding the operation of the existing scheme. It is worthwhile to explain the nature and background of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, introduced an exemption from road tax for vehicles adapted or constructed for and used by disabled persons who, in the main, would have been confined to wheelchairs. The scheme was later extended to allow relief from VAT and vehicle registration tax. A qualifying person was also allowed reliefs from the payment of excise duty on road fuel. To qualify for benefit under the scheme, a disabled person had to be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his (her) legs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The regulations, made under that Act, set out criteria for eligibility for the reliefs as well as specifying their scope and various procedures to be complied with in order to qualify for benefit. The resultant Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, came into operation on 21 December 1989.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions set out in the 1989 scheme was carried out in 1993 and as a result, the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, were drawn up by the Department of Finance. The scheme comes under the remit of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what I said in my reply to the Deputy on 10 May 2000. My Department has no statutory responsibility for these regulations or their operation. To qualify, a person must meet the medical criteria specified in the above regulations which are not set by the Department of Health and Children. The senior area medical officer for the relevant health board area will issue a primary medical certificate if he or she is satisfied that the applicant fulfils the medical criteria set out in the Department of Finance's Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. This role is to assist the operation of the Revenue scheme. If a person is dissatisfied with the senior area medical officer's decision in respect of the primary medical certification, it is open to that person to appeal to the medical board of appeal. However, as with the regulations, the Department of Health and Children has no statutory responsibility for this board of appeal.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, an interdepartmental review group is currently examining the scheme to see what amendments or modifications may be made to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragic murders last weekend of an 81 year old man, Paddy Logan, in his home in Castlejordan, County Meath, and an 18 month old baby boy, Oisin O'Reilly, bring into focus the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as a matter of extreme urgency, to meet the Garda Commissioner to devise an appropriate strategy to combat the upsurge in violent crime.</P>
      <P>There has been a sharp rise in both the numbers of murders and in the level of serious crime compared to last year. So far, 28 people have been murdered this year, which is a staggering statistic. A total of 28 violent deaths so far this year is an unprecedented figure. Victim Support, the voluntary group which provides an alert service for elderly and vulnerable people, has estimated that up to 1,400 elderly people were the victims of crime last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These statistics reveal an appalling and tragic story that is affecting many people and their families countrywide because every one is a horror story of torment that will change forever the lives of those elderly people and rob them of a quality of life. The figures are also a very severe indictment of this Government's record in fighting <Col N="1006" /> crime. Elderly people, particularly those living in isolated rural areas, are vulnerable to attack from criminal gangs who prey on people who live alone. It was particularly sad to read in newspaper reports over recent days that Paddy Logan, who was killed at the weekend, had been a victim of crime in recent months.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the Garda Commissioner, meets officials from Victim Support to devise a strategy to combat serious crime and crime against the elderly in particular. He must then set out that strategy to this House and provide the full means to implement it. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we read, believes that our crime levels have returned to the levels of the 1950s, or so he boasts. If he believes that, he is living in cloud cuckoo land.</P>
    <P>It is now abundantly clear that the Minister's so-called zero tolerance policy has no basis in reality. It is nothing more than a figment of the his imagination. His policy is in tatters in the criminal area and in other areas and it is having no effect in reducing the level of serious crime throughout the country.</P>
    <P>By his own admission last week, 13 criminal gangs are at their evil work bringing death to our streets. As the Minister for Health and Children knows only too well, the heroin problem grows daily in intensity and viciousness, with deaths now resulting from contaminated product adding to the vicious deaths from the gangs who control this insidious trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister's clear failure to tackle crime is undermining confidence in the Garda Síochána and is tempting many people to turn to unacceptable alternatives. We have seen the consequences of the erosion of public confidence in policing in Northern Ireland. We must not allow self styled law enforcers to gain ground in this jurisdiction. I advise the Minister that some of these people are at work in this city.</P>
    <P>Once again, fear has become a feature of Irish life, in our cities, among our elderly living alone, even among young males afraid of assault on our streets. All this is an indictment of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, his policies and his efforts. He should stop making bogus and misleading claims about crime levels and congratulating himself. He should instead ensure that the serious threat which criminal gangs pose to the safety of communities and citizens is tackled. On the evidence to date, the Minister is better at promoting his public image than doing the vital job entrusted to him by this House and the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>The mindless brutality of the attack on the Logan brothers last Sunday evening is a further shocking reminder of the breakdown of law and order in Ireland. The murder of Paddy Logan and the serious injuries inflicted on his <Col N="1007" /> brother Peter highlight the current crisis. There is outrage among the people of Laois, Offaly and Meath and this sense of outrage is shared by people countrywide. The attack on these brothers is all the more alarming as there was an attempt already made to rob them in their home last January.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner to provide, as a matter of urgency, all the necessary manpower, expertise and technical assistance to ensure the perpetrators of this horrific crime against the Logan brothers are caught, convicted and sentenced to a long-term of imprisonment. Brutal gangs are roaming around Ireland and driving people in fear out of their homes. Last year in my constituency, an elderly man living alone was robbed while he was out of his house. Two weeks later, while asleep in bed, this man was savagely assaulted, he was beaten around his head and body, and his house was robbed. This man was left bound and gagged in his own home. Luckily he was found by a neighbour the following day. He has since died and he never returned to his home because he was afraid to go back. No one was ever charged with that crime.</P>
      <P>The Minister must not bury his head in the sand and ignore the crisis. The statistics are alarming. He admitted recently that 13 gangs now operate in Ireland. That is such an alarming statistic that surely the Minister appreciates its relevance. I would like to refer to a few more statistics. Since 1 January 28 people have died in violent circumstances. In the January to May period from 1997 to 2000, killings have risen from ten in 1997, 15 in 1998, 17 in 1999 and 21 to the end of May of this year. In 1999 over 1,400 people were the victims of crime with over 600 of these people being seriously affected as a result. I could list the names, the dates and circumstances of many of the murders. However, the Minister and his Department have the facts and they are chilling statistics.</P>
      <P>Let me point out that behind all these statistics there is a human face, a life and an individual, affected in each and every instance. Such an attack leaves a person traumatised, fearful and psychologically damaged often permanently. The individual is affected and so too is the extended family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked about the Minister changing his attitude to the closure of rural Garda stations. Deputy Howlin was in the House when the former Minister for Justice, Mr. Ray Burke, brought in a policy decision to close rural Garda stations. He made a wrong decision and he has made others to which I will not refer. He made a wrong decision to close the rural Garda stations and we have seen the outcome of that. With the closure of these Garda stations in villages and towns, the green light was given to the criminals that the <Col N="1008" /> Government was soft on crime. In the face of opposition from Fine Gael, the Labour Party and other organisations &ndash; we did everything possible and pleaded with the Government &ndash; the then Minister, Mr. Burke, and the Government totally ignored the views of people opposed to such closures. Since the 1990s crime in rural areas has been out of control and people have been living in fear and dread in their own homes and that remains the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline my views and those of Fine Gael, because I discussed this with our leader and spokesman on justice, on how we can tackle and defeat this ongoing criminal activity. We require a minimum of 3,000 additional Garda Síochána immediately. Fine Gael wants all rural Garda stations which have been closed by the Government to be reopened and properly staffed and manned. It is important that incentives are provided to encourage members of the Garda Síochána to live in the area in which they are stationed. A greater Garda presence on the streets is required. A redeployment of members of the Garda Síochána is necessary at peak times, such as the closure of pubs, clubs and discos when large groups assemble. Legislation making it mandatory on judges to impose long prison sentences on people convicted of violent crimes is needed. The bottom line is that a journalist gave her life trying to tackle organised crime in Ireland. I hope that journalist did not die in vain.</P>

      <P>Attacks on the elderly are despicable and cowardly crimes. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, would like to be here tonight to convey this message but, as the Deputies, will know he is at the United Nations conference abroad. Such attacks on the elderly can create a climate of fear and apprehension, particularly on the part of elderly people living alone. I reiterate that the Government and the Garda Síochána are determined to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain a situation whereby people can feel safe in their homes. No effort will be spared to ensure that the perpetrators of the crime we are discussing this evening are apprehended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not want in any way to minimise the seriousness of what happened at the weekend, it would be unfortunate if anything said here this evening were to be lead to unnecessary fears on the part of elderly people. While provisional <Col N="1009" /> Garda statistics indicate that 13 people aged 65 years or over were victims of murder or manslaughter in the period referred to by Deputy Howlin, it would be wrong to group all of these together as if they were, in some way, related. I understand that the individual circumstances vary widely from case to case and that some of these killings arose from domestic incidents. Furthermore, I understand that in some other cases robbery would not have been a motive. I should stress also that in all but two of these cases, detections have been made.</P>
    <P>It is important for me to emphasise also that Deputy Enright is wrong when he refers to an ongoing policy of closing Garda stations in small villages and towns. I take this opportunity to re-state the Government's position in relation to the rural community policing scheme. There has been some misunderstanding over the years concerning the objectives of the rural community policing scheme.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about one thing &ndash; the scheme is not about closing rural Garda stations. It is aimed at providing a better service to the community by allowing gardaí spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including, in particular, visits to the elderly, while at the same time providing for station opening hours which actually suit local community needs. Let me remind the House that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is on record as stating that no Garda station will close during his tenure as Minister and any suggestion or comments from whatever quarter which imply otherwise are quite simply wrong.</P>
    <P>I would also like to assure the House that this Government has not been associated with and has no agenda in relation to the closure of Garda stations or reduction of policing services to the public. The position is quite the contrary. The programme for Government provides for additional Garda recruitment with a view to bringing the strength of the force to 12,000. When this Government came into office, the strength of the force was 10,800. By the end of this year, Garda strength will be 11,600 approximately. This represents a remarkable increase in Garda numbers by any standard. This increase in the strength of the force means that there are more gardaí available to fight crime and to protect the public in both urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to resources, the position is quite clear. The Government's policy has been and will continue to be to ensure that the Garda Síochána has the necessary resources to enable it to do its job to the utmost of its capabilities. This Government has increased the resources available to the Garda and never in the history of the State has the Garda been better resourced or equipped. That is beyond dispute or argument.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, the allocation for Garda expenditure provided in the 1997 Esti<Col N="1010" /> mates for the Garda Vote was a figure of £494 million. This year's provision is £668 million. The House may not be aware, but it is worth noting, that that the Garda fleet has increased very considerably during that time, from 1,350 in 1997 to in excess of 1,900 vehicles today, not only enhancing the force's mobility but also modernising and upgrading its equipment.</P>
    <P>In terms of flexibility and providing a rapid response, it is hard to compete with the Garda air support unit which includes a fixed wing aircraft and helicopter equipped with the most modern technology. A second helicopter is also being provided which will greatly expand the area of operations of the air support unit and allow for 24 hour availability of air support in the ongoing fight against crime.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that a full investigation is under way into the recent attack at Castlejordan on the Meath-Offaly border. While obviously it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any detail, I can tell the House that detectives from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and forensic experts are assisting a large number of local gardaí. I understand that house to house inquiries are being made and that checkpoints are being operated. As I already indicated, I assure the House that no resources will be spared to bring the perpetrators to justice.</P>
    <P>The problem of attacks on the elderly particularly in rural areas during the course of robberies is one which has emerged from time to time over the past 20 years or so. However, it is important to stress that concerted action by the Garda Síochána in co-operation with local communities has paid great dividends in dealing with this problem. The actions taken have included special operations at regional, divisional and district levels, support of community alert schemes, liaising with local community groups and giving crime prevention advice <i>via</i> the local crime prevention officers.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform co-fund Muintir na Tíre which operates the community alert programme. Community alert is a community-based initiative, organised by Muintir na Tíre which is active throughout the country with a network of more than 1,100 committees. I understand the five development officers which Muintir na Tíre employs have organised a considerable number of seminars throughout the country to advise people of the introduction of the euro and of the implications of keeping their savings in their homes, bearing in mind the impending currency changeover. Naturally, I echo the concerns of my colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in relation to the closure of financial institutions in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Elderly people are also advised, through these schemes, on crime prevention and on the avail<Col N="1011" /> ability of funding for schemes, such as the scheme of community support for older people through which some £13 million has been allocated since 1997 by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>The commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is to establish an interdepartmental committee to identify and clarify the range of existing and proposed social inclusion measures in the national development plan for which integrated targeted intervention measures can be developed for the 25 most deprived urban and rural communities. The interdepartmental committee of senior officials working to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion is addressing this matter and will report to the July meeting of the Cabinet committee. This will set the parameters for the more detailed analysis which will enable the areas, and the related investment programme, to be finalised.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the PPF, there will be full consultation with the social partners on this issue. I am confident that this will be complete well in advance of the target of next December, set down in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>The 2010 committee report was presented to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on 24 March. It contains a considerable number of recommendations and findings. The Minister is undertaking a round of consultations with the representative organisations including the CSO and other bodies on these findings and recommendations in the period ahead. It would be inappropriate to take a definitive position on any individual proposal in the report until these consultations are completed. It is expected that the consultations will be completed by end June.</P>

      <P>The monthly live register figures show how many people are claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or signing for social welfare credits. At the end of May, there were 152,871 persons on the live register. The results are normally published within a week, making the live register a widely-used short-term indicator. The CSO's monthly releases contain a considerable amount of detail at local level, including breakdowns of the number of claimants by sex, age group and type of claimant.</P>
      <P>However, the live register does not measure unemployment on a basis that is comparable over time or between countries. It is an administrative measure and the figures reflect people's benefit status as distinct from their labour force status. It includes many people who are not unemployed &ndash; for example, part-time workers who are entitled under the social welfare rules to sign on in respect of days when they do not have work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary source of comparable statistics on unemployment is the quarterly national household survey. This survey provides quarterly figures on employment and unemployment which meet the ILO's guidelines for internationally comparable labour force statistics. Now that the main results of this survey are being published within three months, the CSO has established a labour market statistics liaison group which will advise the office on how its labour market publications can best meet the needs of data users. This will include the continuing publication of live register statistics as well as more detailed <Col N="1015" /> results from the quarterly national household survey. There are no plans to discontinue the publication of the live register in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, included provision for 33 million ECU, £26 million, towards the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.</P>
      <P>A tender procedure, organised by Bord Fáilte, under the direction of the independent management board for product development, and conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, was launched in September 1997 and culminated, in June 1998, in the selection of the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited, to go forward for grant-aid to develop the conference centre at a site in Dublin's docklands.</P>
      <P>Following a submission by the Government, the EU Commission, in November 1998, gave its approval, in principle, for a grant of 33 million ECU to the project with drawdown subject to resolution of an outstanding procedural complaint and the compatibility of any preferential tax regimes for the project with State aids rules.</P>
      <P>The Commission closed its file on the procedural complaint in April 1999.</P>
      <P>Having received confirmation from the Commission on permissible time limits for the grant drawdown, contract documentation was agreed and signed by Bord Fáilte and the developer by end-December, 1999. The Department of Finance and the Commission are still in correspondence on the taxation issues and related matters. Meanwhile, planning permission issued by Dublin Corporation in August last year, is under appeal. An Bord Pleanála has concluded an oral hearing on the case and it expects to have a decision next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The provision in the revised Estimates for 2000 for my Department for the expenditure on sporting and recreational amenities and facilities, together with the budget for the Irish Sports Council, from the proceeds of the National Lottery and other sources is £51.478 million. This is made up as follows: sports capital programme grants &ndash; national lottery funded &ndash; £15.2 million; Croke Park development grant &ndash;  national lottery funded &ndash; £6 million; grant for 50 metre swimming pool &ndash; Exchequer funded &ndash; £4.69 million, grants for the provision and renovation of swimming pools £15.18 million &ndash; Exchequer funded; and Irish Sports Council, £10,408 million. This figure, when compared to the 1999 expenditure of £39.331 million in respect of the same areas of expenditure, represents an increase of some 31%.</P>
      <P>My Department has received more than 1,600 applications under the 2000 sports capital programme and these are currently being assessed. I intend to announce the 2000 round of allocations at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The statutory Irish Sports Council has direct responsibility, since 1 July 1999, for the allocation of grants to sports organisations, and any information on the distribution of funds to the organisations for non-capital expenditure can be obtained from the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile, I have arranged for details of the grants paid to each national governing body of sport in 1999, as well as the list of allocations made under the 1999 sports capital programme, <Col N="1017" /> and payments made for 1999 under the local authority swimming pool programme, to be circulated separately for the information of the Deputies. This significantly increased provision for sports funding is enabling significant improvements and advances to be made across the spectrum of sports development.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the regional tourism authorities. The RTAs were established by Bord Fáilte, under the Tourist Traffic Acts, for the promotion and development of tourism on a regional basis. In line with the commitment set out in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, Bord Fáilte initiated a review of the RTAs during 1999. The objective of the review is to ensure that RTAs are positioned to make the optimum contribution to the realisation of national tourism objectives and targets set by Government while taking into account regional priorities and customer focus. In the context of the review, a report on the RTAs was commissioned by BFE from Fitzpatrick Associates to assist the deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions between officials from my Department and Bord Fáilte on issues arising from the review process were concluded recently and I understand that the RTA chairmen have already been supplied with a copy of the Fitzpatrick report, which is an important input to the review. <Col N="1028" /> Last week, Bord Fáilte met with the managers of the RTAs to inform them of the outcome of the review and set out their vision for the future of the RTAs.</P>
    <P>As most of the authorities are still considering the conclusions emerging from the review, the Deputy will understand that I am reluctant to go into too much detail at this point. However, I hope that it will lead to a clearer definition of roles for the RTAs, a greater strategic vision for development of tourism within their regions and an injection of dynamism into the process of regional planning and co-ordination.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan, published in November 1999, included a specific allocation of £150 million for a tourism marketing sub-programme over the period 2000 to 2006. The marketing sub-programme consists of two measures, a destination marketing measure and a niche marketing measure, to be funded from Ireland's first ever multi-annual tourism marketing fund. The main focus of this fund is to finance the promotion and marketing internationally of Ireland as a tourism destination. The first annual allocation under the fund has been incorporated in my Department's year 2000 Estimates &ndash; a provision of £14.4 million under a new subhead B.11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give effect to the commitment in the national development plan that the new fund will incorporate a public-private partnership arrangement, I was pleased to announce in April the establishment of a new tourism marketing partnership &ndash; TMP &ndash; involving Bord Fáilte and the Irish tourism industry. I propose to circulate a copy of the press release in the Official Report. The TMP is designed to bring about a greater level of synergy between industry and State involvement in international marketing. The new partnership will allow industry and Bord Fáilte to jointly oversee planning and implementation of funding provided under the NDP for tourism marketing and so inform overall industry marketing expenditure, thereby maximising the impact of the totality of Irish tourism marketing. The TMP held its first meeting last month and will be <Col N="1029" /> assisted in its task by two sub-groups focusing on the key areas of international destination marketing, and niche-product marketing.</P>

    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Dr. James McDaid T.D., today (Wednesday 19th April, 2000) in a major development in the marketing of Irish tourism, announced details of a new Partnership involving representatives of the tourist industry, to work together with Bord Fáilte in developing complementary strategies and plans for the totality of their combined annual marketing expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The key objectives of the Partnership are:</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>the optimum deployment of all international tourism marketing funds through the pooling of expertise and experience of Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry;</P>
    <P>the preparation and review of multi-annual marketing strategies linked to the achievement of the targets for tourism growth set in the National Development Plan (NDP); and</P>
    <P>agreement on annual tourism marketing plans and programmes for approval by Bord Fáilte, with particular emphasis on how such plans/programmes could best be deployed to complement and support industry's own marketing efforts.</P>
    <P>The ground-breaking arrangement delivers on the Government's commitment that the newly established Tourism Marketing Fund of £150m, would incorporate a public/private partnership and so ensure adequate funding for destination marketing over the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The fund is additional to the estimated £40 Million spent annually by the industry itself on marketing its products and a primary aim of the partnership will be to secure the most appropriate match between public and private expenditure. It is envisaged that the new Partnership will also be making major use, in its plans, of the soon to be revamped All-island Tourism Brand Ireland, currently being reviewed by Bord Fáilte and NITB with a view to securing the best possible profile in international tourism markets for Ireland, into the first decade of the new Millennium.</P>
    <P>Minister McDaid has set a target for the tourism sector of 5% annual growth, which is expected to deliver annual foreign exchange earnings from tourism of £3.5 billion and 50,000 new full-time jobs by the end of the NDP.</P>
    <P>The new partnership will have subgroups focusing on the key areas of (i) international destination marketing, and (ii) niche/product marketing.</P>
    <P>Minister McDaid said that partnership between the tourism industry and Bord Fáilte had been well established under the very successful Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999. He added that the industry had played an important role, in particular, through its involvement in the <Col N="1030" /> EU Co-funded Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative Ltd., which carried out major tourism destination marketing campaigns in Ireland's four key markets &ndash; U.S., Britain, Germany and France.</P>
    <P>Commenting on the new structures, Minister McDaid said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The challenges facing the tourism sector over the next 7 years are formidable with increased international competition, a more discerning visitor and environmental and labour market pressures at home. I am looking to the partnership as a new vehicle to help address the marketing challenges involved in a spirit of mutual co-operation between the State and the industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new arrangement represents new thinking for new times and I am delighted that we now have a clear and constructive framework to promote continued growth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Tourism Marketing Partnership will be chaired by Mr. Redmond O'Donoghue, Chairman of Bord Fáilte and Chief Executive of Waterford Crystal, and will include nominees from the industry by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and senior executives of Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <Quest>his views of the implications for Irish tourism of the findings of the recent Bord Fáilte survey on attitudes of tourists which found, in particular, dissatisfaction with car hire, Ireland's suitability for all-year round holidays, litter and pollution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15918/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Bord Fáilte's 1999 visitor attitude survey, nine out of every ten holiday makers said that their experience of Ireland matched or exceeded their expectations. Only 6% were dissatisfied with their Irish holiday compared to 5% in 1997. The main contributors to visitors' positive experiences were scenery and people. Areas of dissatisfaction were competitiveness of car hire, weather and litter-pollution.</P>
      <P>We cannot be complacent about our environment, scenery and the welcome given to tourists. These and other elements of Ireland and Irish life are all crucial to the enjoyment of the experience by overseas visitors. Any significant diminution of their attractiveness will obviously impact adversely on the market place. It is for this reason that Bord Fáilte monitors visitor attitudes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism industry is, of course, well aware of the importance of visitor perception and satisfaction levels. The Irish Tourism Industry Confederation has initiated a people and place programme, which was supported by the tourism <Col N="1031" /> environment initiative, under the tourism operational programme, 1994-1999, to raise the awareness of the importance of tourism and particularly of extending a warm welcome to our visitors.</P>
    <P>Tourism flows both in domestic and international markets, are now spread across a greater part of the year than heretofore, and the aim is to increase seasonal spread even further. My focus will continue to be to facilitate the creation of a marketing strategy which can spread visitor numbers over time and help generate better regional spread. This will help to reduce pressures resulting from unnecessary over-concentration in time and place of tourism, in individual localities.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that a recent report suggests that our water quality is improving, and my views on the litter issue are well known. I know that local authorities are now taking a more proactive role in eradicating litter. I am also aware that the National Anti-Litter Forum, established by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government last July to assess current anti-litter initiatives and to formulate a programme of action that enhances and extends these initiatives, is due to report shortly. The forum is expected to come up with a list of priorities, but while its report may well come up with actions which public authorities can take on this issue, I think that we also have to acknowledge the sad fact that litter is generated by individual citizens and it is only a major change in attitude by individuals that will eradicate the problem. We have been tolerant of litter for far too long. It is time for change. We do not just owe it to our visitors, we owe it to ourselves. In that context, I hope that the report of the forum can mark the beginning of a sea-change in attitudes on this issue.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to car hire, while the levels of quality and customer service are relatively high, 23% of visitors who rented a car did express dissatisfaction in terms of price. Price in this sector is affected by issues such as duration of rentals, insurance premia, energy costs, replacement rates, etc. The car rental sector will need to continue to be aware of the need to be competitive, particularly in the light of the considerable expansion in fleet size over recent years, to meet ongoing growth in demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in earlier replies to Deputy Deasy, I believe the implementation of national tourism marketing and promotion policies is best undertaken by a dedicated executive body such as Bord Fáilte, working in <Col N="1032" /> concert with the tourism industry. However, having said that, I would like to bring to the Deputy's attention, a major policy development under the Good Friday Multi-party Northern Ireland peace Agreement and, in particular, the associated commitment to establish a North/South company with responsibility for all island international tourism marketing. When fully implemented, this development will further refine overall arrangements for international tourism marketing through an enhanced all-island approach.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the establishment in April of this year of a new tourism marketing partnership involving Bord Fáilte and the Irish tourism industry is designed to bring about a greater level of synergy between industry and the board in international tourism marketing planning and implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30 April last I travelled to the west coast of the US on a tourism promotional visit. My primary objective in attending a number of functions in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco was to support the marketing efforts of Bord Fáilte and our tourism industry. Tourism revenue from the US has grown at a rate of 14% per year over the past decade, our most impressive growth market over that period.</P>
      <P>While we have enjoyed unprecedented success in the US, it is clear that there are many parts of the US, particularly the west coast, with potential for further growth. The introduction by Aer Lingus of a new direct non-stop air service from Los Angeles to Dublin was a major boost for Irish tourism and I and Bord Fáilte were anxious to capitalise on this welcome development.</P>
      <P>While speaking at a number of functions attended by the local travel trade and media, I emphasised a number of Ireland's key attractions for the US visitor including our unique scenery, our people, our first class food, accommodation, and tourist facilities and amenities. In particular, I highlighted our world class golfing facilities and our preparations for the hosting of the Ryder Cup in 2005.</P>
      <P>I also acknowledged our gratitude for the ongoing support of many prominent Americans for our efforts to find a peaceful and just solution to the long troubled situation in Northern Ireland. I instanced the tourism sector as one of many where increased co-operation between north and south would operate for the mutual benefit of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prospects for the US market are good. Bord Fáilte is forecasting another very strong year for tourism from North America this year and expect <Col N="1033" /> numbers to exceed one million for the first time and revenue to increase by 10%.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date on the initiative he launched in 1999, which was aimed primarily at the small accommodation provider, whereby Bord Fáilte would carry out a fundamental review of the way in which the various groups in this category are branded and marketed overseas with a view to increasing business overall and particularly in the off-peak season in rural areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15923/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1999, a new initiative was launched specifically to assist the marketing efforts of smaller accommodation providers. A budget of £300,000 was allocated to this initiative in 1999 and a further £500,000 is being spent in 2000. Bord Fáilte has responsibility for implementing the initiative and has engaged in extensive consultations with the smaller accommodation sector.</P>
      <P>I understand from Bord Fáilte that a comprehensive range of activities have been undertaken to assist the sector to promote and market their services to a wider audience. The activities undertaken include: the fostering of closer working relationships between Irish Farm Holidays and Town and Country Homes Association including the establishment of a marketing steering committee; the implementation of marketing campaigns and programmes for the sector last year and this year in all Ireland's overseas markets; the provision by Bord Fáilte of a series of workshops and seminars for small operators to provide a forum for discussion and some guidance on marketing activities. A manual/handbook is being developed for circulation to each approved B&amp;B; and the Regional Tourism Authorities have been very much involved in progressing the initiative and have agreed to provide an enhanced advisory service at local level. In addition, this year Bord Fáilte intend to develop suitable initiatives to support the marketing of one-star and two-star hotels. This will build on work already under way in this sector. Other sectors which will also receive attention include the caravan and camping, guesthouse, hostel and rented sectors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the key overall marketing objectives in tourism over the next seven years, under the national development plan, are to increase tourism revenue and <i>per diem</i> visitor yield and to help industry achieve a wider seasonal and regional distribution of tourist revenue thereby contributing to sustainable development goals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growth in tourism over the past ten years has been unprecedented, with visitor numbers to Ireland doubling to six million and foreign exchange earnings tripling to £2.5 billion. It is important to recognise that all regions have shared in this growth, with the best performances coming from the midlands-east, Dublin and <Col N="1034" /> south-west regions. However, there has been some variation in performance, in particular, due to international industry trends such as the growth in short breaks and urban tourism.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise has been overseeing a policy of encouraging development by carriers of the maximum number of sustainable new routes. I am particularly pleased that a number of new air services to the US and continental Europe have opened up in recent years, which have already had a significant impact in terms of increased tourism business. I also welcome initiatives such as the soon to be launched Derry-Dublin air service, which will considerably enhance access, for example, to the north-west region. Both these developments help to promote tourism to Ireland and increase the business opportunities for small accommodation providers and other constituents of the tourism sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 203 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>This Government has increased funding for the development of sport and recreational facilities by over 350% since coming into office, from £8.5 million in 1997 to £41.07 million in the Estimates for the year 2000. This includes: more than a trebling in funding for the sport capital programme from £5 million in 1997 to £15.2 million in 2000; more than a quadrupling in the provision for the swimming pool programme from £3.5 million in 1997 to £15.18 million in 2000; assistance for the development of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool; and a £20 million grant towards the development of Croke Park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> The sports capital programme provides funding for sporting facilities at national, regional and local level. Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities my Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with all the national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. My Department also consults with the Irish Sports Council, other Government Departments and with the local authorities in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, special priority is given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas. In addition, applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their area, and the local authority before making an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities. Sports clubs developing projects at national level are also required to ensure that the proposals are consistent with the priorities of their respective national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>This programme, together with the expanded local authority swimming pool programme, the 50 metre pool in Limerick, the improved Croke Park and planned development of Sports Campus Ireland will provide the country with a much increased range of top class indoor and outdoor sports facilities.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, financial assistance amounting to £85 million will be available over the seven years of the plan to support the development of sport and recreational facilities by local authorities, particularly in areas which lack them and for voluntary groups developing multi-sport and recreational facilities where no such facilities currently exist.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, and I am sure the House will agree, that there is now under this Government an ambitious programme of state assisted expansion under way in a wide range of sports facilities and support services, catering for both the elite participant and the general public, right across the country.</P>

      <P>My Department has not received any application for financial assistance from the FAI for the Eircom Park project. The FAI made separate presentations of their Arena proposal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself prior to the public launch of their project. The FAI representatives were at pains to make it clear to the Government that their project would be self-financing and not reliant on any external grant aid. This was subsequently confirmed in the documentation that accompanied the public launch of the arena project. The FAI did state that they had longer term plans for the construction of a national youth coaching and Development Centre and said that it was likely that they would be seeking Government support for that project.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Government's clearly expressed wish is that the FAI come on board the Stadium Ireland project. In my view it makes sports and business sense for the FAI to avail of the Stadium Ireland facility.</P>
      <P>The FAI could have full use of the National Stadium and it would not be faced with capital debt repayments or infrastructural costs. In the event that the FAI decides to come on board the Stadium Ireland project it would be able to expend its financial resources, currently being earmarked for the development of Eircom Park, on the development of soccer in this country on an unprecedented scale.</P>
      <P>The Government's announcement of Sports Campus Ireland is part of an overall strategy to allow individual sports associations to concentrate on developing and investing in their own sports at all levels.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has adopted the guidelines for the new URBAN initiative, to be known as URBAN II, for the period 2000-06. The guidelines for URBAN II, 2000-06, were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 19 May 2000 when member states were invited to present proposals for URBAN II programmes, before mid-November, 2000.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, one urban area with a population of at least 20,000 will be the subject of support for which five million euros/IR£3.9 million has been allocated from EU funds.</P>

    <P>My Department has commenced examination of the various options available to us in terms of the identification, in consultation with relevant agencies, of potential candidate investment areas. This will be followed by the selection of the most appropriate site, in accordance with the criteria laid down in the Commission guidelines for URBAN II.</P>

      <P>The regulation of charities is a matter that falls within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Pending the finalisation of planned legislation in the area, the Minister took the view that the current audit obligations of guarantee companies, many of which operate as charities, should remain. Accordingly, the audit exemption provisions in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999, do not apply to guarantee companies by virtue of section 32(3)(a)(i) of the Act. Banks and certain other entities in the financial sector are also precluded from availing of the audit exemption under section 32(3)(a)(v) of the Act.</P>
      <P>Under subparagraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) of section 32(3)(a) of the Act, the companies which qualify for exemption are those which do not have an annual turnover of £250,000; whose balance sheet total for the year does not exceed £1.5 million; and, where the average number of employees does not exceed 50 in that year.</P>
      <P>A decision by the directors of a qualifying company to avail of the audit exemption is subject to the various conditions and limitations set out in Part III of the Act.</P>
      <P>The Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 (Commencement) Order, 1999 (S.I. No. 406 of 1999) and the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 (Commencement) Order, 2000 (S.I. No. 61 of 2000) set out the dates on which specified sections of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 came into force. The provisions relating to the audit exemption were brought into force on 21 February, 2000.</P>

      <P>The prices of new cars are set by the market. Consumers are encouraged to shop around to get the best deal available. Should consumers have concerns in relation to possible anti-competitive practices, remedies exist under competition law. These are: In Ireland, complaints may be addressed to the Competition Authority; and, where trade between EU member states is concerned, complaints may be addressed to the European Commission &ndash; Directorate-General responsible for Competition.</P>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, I might mention that the Commission has been involved in the past in a number of cases relating to the new car market across the EU, and has taken at least one successful legal action in their regard. A number of investigations specifically in relation to new car prices has been carried out by the Commission, although these have not been the subject of legal actions to date. I understand that, in recent times, the Commission has been following up fresh complaints about competition issues regarding the new cars market including, <i>inter alia, </i>allegations of anti-competitive practices, throughout the EU; and that premises in Ireland were among those visited. This latest investigation by the Commission has not yet been concluded. I am aware of the recent survey in Britain. There is no proposal to have a comparative survey of the kind referred to by the Deputy undertaken in Ireland.</P>

    <P>While our Department has not carried out any formal comparisons between the financial assistance available to researchers in Ireland and abroad, I understand that the USA and most European countries have formal support structures in place for research students. It is difficult to draw conclusions from direct comparisons between national research funding mechanisms, due to the complexity of support structures involved and the differences in costs of living.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland periodically reviews the financial assistance which it provides to researchers, both postgraduate and post-doctoral, so as to ensure that the rates are appropriate to their purpose of supporting the highest level of excellence in research in Ireland. The position will be kept under review in the context of the development of new schemes for the period covered by the National Development Plan 2000-06, which contains a figure of £1.95 billion for research, technological development and innovation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties being experienced by young people in securing motor insurance and the high cost of compulsory insurance cover for young drivers is directly attributable to the adverse claims experience of such drivers as a risk category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report by Deloitte &amp; Touche which evaluated insurance costs in Ireland found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 <Col N="1041" /> year old drivers was twice that for the 36 to 40 age group. The report also noted that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group were responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
    <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Therefore, the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which was re-established by me in 1998, was a major initiative aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The board, whose expanded membership includes a member representing young drivers' interests, has undertaken an ambitious programme of work and research, particularly regarding the basis of charges to young drivers.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness amongst all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Díon fund was established in 1984 to assist welfare organisations in Britain by providing financial assistance towards the employment of professional workers dealing with the welfare problems of Irish workers. In 1994, the Díon Committee took a decision to withdraw from funding direct counselling services and to concentrate on the core funding approach as the means of maximising the impact of the overall grant available at that time &ndash; £500,000. Such services did not appear to provide the required element of welfare, employment advice or referral service which would bring <Col N="1042" /> it within Díon's remit and funding for these services was phased out in 1995.</P>
      <P>In 1998, to reflect current practice, counselling costs &ndash; as well as locum cover for maternity leave &ndash; were specifically excluded from Díon funding in the Díon Strategic Plan 1998-2000. At that time the Díon Committee considered that it would be more appropriate for organisations providing counselling services to concentrate on lobbying local health authorities for funding, and that the provision of statutory funding from such sources would help to improve and ensure the quality and standard of such services. In addition, as the delivery of counselling services needs to be closely monitored by professionals in the field on an ongoing basis, the committee considered that it did not have access to the expertise needed to monitor a counselling service.</P>
      <P>In March, a request was received from Immigrant Counselling and Psychotherapy for a Díon grant application form for 2000. ICAP were informed that counselling services are not eligible for Díon funding as such services are specifically excluded in the Díon Strategic Plan 1998-2000. I understand that, consequently, ICAP did not submit an application by 27 March, the closing date for receipt of grant applications. ICAP did, however, submit an expression of interest for the research project concerning the needs of the Irish community in Britain which Díon has commissioned this year, but a formal application was not received by the closing date of 26 April.</P>
      <P>As the counselling and psychotherapy services provided by ICAP do not come within Díon's current remit, I regret that funding from this source cannot be provided this year. As in previous years, the Díon fund for 2000 will be allocated in line with its criteria for ensuring that the fund provides the maximum benefit to the Irish community as a whole. This does not reflect in any adverse way on the quality of the counselling services provided by ICAP to members of the Irish community.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, one of the objectives set out in the Government's Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is to address the special needs of those Irish emigrants abroad who are particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion. In this context, it has been agreed to establish a task force under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and comprising of social partner and other relevant interests, to develop a coherent long-term approach to Irish emigrants and their needs, building on the initiatives already being undertaken by that Department and by my Department. The issue of funding for counselling services to Irish emigrants could be examined in this context and ICAP may, if they so wish, make a submission to the task force in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>On the issue of safety on leisure craft, as the Deputies are aware, the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft &ndash; including personal watercraft &ndash; recently presented me with its final report. This report made a number of recommendations including some in respect to the carriage and use of lifejackets, carriage of safety equipment and consumption of alcohol. On the basis of this, I am currently proposing the introduction of a legislative framework for the regulation of recreational craft. This is being achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which are included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999. The Bill passed the Dáil Report and Final Stages on 24 May 2000 and Second Stage in the Seanad is scheduled for 8 June 2000.</P>
      <P>The Bill foresees the implementation of regulations to take account not only the safety of the passengers and occupants of the vessels in question but also the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the vessels and any disturbance or nuisance caused by their usage.</P>
      <P>Following on the enactment of this piece of legislation, I hope to quickly introduce implementing regulations based on the recommendations of the action group's final report. I consider that these regulations, allied to the recently launched Year 2000 Safety on the Water campaign, will contribute to an increase in safety in the water-based leisure sector and a resultant decrease in the emergency calls received by the emergency services in future.</P>

      <P>The application for higher forestry incentives submitted to the European Commission last year proposed increased premium levels for those who planted in previous years under Council Regulation 2080/92 as well as for those proposing to plant in the current season. Due to the protracted nature of the discussions with the Commission, it was decided that the primary initial focus would be on securing increases which would have an impact on planting in the current season. The substantial increases in grants and premiums announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, on 6 March will help achieve that objective. The increased rates of grant and premium apply to all those who have planted since 1 October 1999.</P>
      <P>I am now pursuing as a matter of priority the question of adequate premium increases for those who planted in earlier years. At a meeting with Commissioner Fischler on 28 March I stressed the importance I attach to this matter. A meeting has been fixed at official level with the Commission this week to advance the issue.</P>
      <P>A meeting with Commission officials on this submission will be held shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the action the Government proposes to take on Recommendation No. 1456 (2000) of the General Assembly of the Council of Europe on the conflict in Chechnya; and if the Government proposes to use Article 33 of the European Convention to refer to the court alleged breaches by Russia of the European Convention of Human Rights.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government shares the deep concerns of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the situation in Chechnya, as reflected in Recommendation No. 1456 of 2000 and other recommendations and declarations of the Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish chairmanship of the Council of Europe worked intensively on this question over the six months of the chairmanship which concluded on 11 May. At meetings which I had with Foreign Minister Ivanov of the Russian Federation in Luxembourg and New York following the adoption by the Parliamentary Assembly of Recommendation No. 1456 and again at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers which I chaired on 10-11 May, I strongly emphasised the need for Russia to respond constructively and substantively to the concerns of the Parliamentary Assembly, in particular regarding the investigation of human rights violations, the commence<Col N="1046" /> ment of political dialogue with Chechnyan political representatives and the deployment of Council of Europe experts to Mr. Kalamanov's office.</P>
    <P>At the Committee of Ministers meeting on 10-11 May, Russia gave a number of commitments on issues raised in Recommendation No. 1456. These are reflected in the communiqué which was issued following the meeting. On the basis of these commitments, the Committee of Ministers was able to conclude at that time that steps were being taken by Russia to address the concerns of the Assembly.</P>
    <P>It is important that these commitments are followed up with concrete actions on the ground. The Committee of Ministers is obliged to present a report to the Parliamentary Assembly for its June session at which a conclusion will have to be reached on the core issue of whether &ldquo;the substantial, accelerating and demonstrable&rdquo; progress called for in Recommendation No. 1456 is being made by Russia. On that basis, the committee will have to decide on its response to the Parliamentary Assembly. Although no longer in the Chair, Ireland will continue to follow closely the developments in Chechnya and we will be looking for clear evidence of actual implementation by Russia of its commitments. In our view, no option should at this stage be excluded.</P>
    <P>My hope is that Russia will act on these very specific commitments. The question of the added value of an inter-state case under Article 33 of the European Convention on Human Rights would need to be examined in the light of the outcome of Russia's actions. In our view, the initiation of such a case would be premature at this time.</P>

      <P>The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is based on the Barcelona Declaration of November 1995, which contains a number of commitments relating to the general areas of the development of democracy, law and human rights which are relevant to the issue of judicial reform.</P>
      <P>All the partners have undertaken to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;.act in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other obligations under international law, in particular those arising out of regional and international agreements to which they are party; develop the rule of law and democracy in their political systems, while recognising in this framework the right of each of them to choose and freely develop its own political, socio-cultural, economic and <Col N="1047" /> judicial system; respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and guarantee the effective legitimate exercise of such rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression, freedom of association for peaceful purposes and freedom of thought, conscience and religion, both individually and together with other members of the same group, without any discrimination on grounds of race, nationality, language, religion or sex&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is also seeking to develop the judicial co-operation necessary for the effective combating of drug trafficking, international crime and terrorism. A meeting of senior officials from all 27 Euro-Mediterranean partner countries next November will examine closer co-operation in these areas.</P>
    <P>Despite some setbacks the Algerian Government has committed itself to the democratisation and reform process. Algeria's constitution of 1996 guarantees basic human rights, including an independent judiciary. Algeria is also party to a number of human rights conventions, such as the international covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights and the convention against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</P>
    <P>The EU has encouraged Algeria to honour these commitments and to persevere with necessary reforms, modernisation, and improvement of human rights, and has offered constructive assistance through the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Ireland is continuing to take a very active part in these discussions.</P>

      <P>Under the new rules on the milk quota regime which I introduced on 1 April this year, the main instrument for the transfer of milk quotas will be a milk quota restructuring scheme operated at milk purchaser level.</P>
      <P>This year's milk quota restructuring scheme will cater, as a matter of priority, for those producers who had been dependent on temporary leasing over recent years and for those producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases.</P>
      <P>Of the total pool available for sale under the restructuring scheme, 85% will be allocated to producers who were dependent on temporary leasing over the past three years and to producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases. The remaining 15%, plus any quota remaining unallocated after the entitlements of the special priority producers have been satisfied, will be allocated to all producers who applied for quota under the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme. These allocations will be weighted in favour of producers in the small and medium size categories.</P>
      <P>With the aim of making quota available at a reasonable cost, and having taken advice from the milk quota review group, I introduced a maximum price of £0.36 per litre for the purchase of quota from the 2000 restructuring scheme. In addition, the Minister for Finance introduced a favourable tax structure for the purchase of quota from the restructuring scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the milk quota appeals tribunal is a body established to consider applications for additional quota from producers who have suffered extreme hardship as a result of the introduction of the milk quota system. The tribunal has not as yet commenced examining applications for the 2000-2001 milk quota year.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for an application form to be issued to the person named as soon as they become available.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 155 of 19 April 2000, the person named submitted a 1998 area aid application that included a parcel of land in respect of which a dual claim was determined. My Department contacted the herdowner to clarify the matter some time ago, but no response has been received. Consequently the area aid application could not be fully processed and this in turn has held up processing of his 1998 applications under the 1998 cattle headage and suckler cow schemes.</P>
      <P>The person named claimed a total of 19.54 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 13.80 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 5.74 hectares or 42% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore, in this case as the overclaim is greater than 20%, no payments can issue in respect of his applications under the 1999 cattle headage or suckler cow schemes.</P>
      <P>There is no record of any applications being received under the 1998 or 1999 sheep headage schemes.</P>

      <P>This year's milk quota restructuring scheme will cater, as a matter of priority, for those producers who had been dependent on temporary leasing over recent years and for those producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases. I decided to structure this year's scheme in this way following consultation with organisations involved in the industry and taking account in particular of the views of the milk quota review group.</P>
      <P>It was necessary, when deciding on the priorities for this year, to make particular provision for those producers who would be most directly affected by the change to the new regime and whose position, in the absence of priority access to quota, could be worse than last year. One of the aims is to try to give producers who had temporary leased quota in the past, regardless of their quota size, access to the same quantity of quota this year in so far as possible.</P>
      <P>Of the total pool available for sale under the restructuring scheme, 85% will be allocated to producers who were dependent on temporary leasing over the past three years and to producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases. The remaining 15%, plus any quota remaining unallocated after the entitlements of the special priority producers have been satisfied, will be allocated to all producers who applied for quota under the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme. In cases where the demand in the priority category exceeds the quantity available and in the case of allocations from the 15% open to all producers, allocations will be weighted in favour of smaller scale producers.</P>
      <P>The temporary leasing scheme will of course, continue to operate and I will announce details of that scheme at a later stage. The operation of the temporary leasing scheme, and in particular the setting of priority categories, will have regard to the outcome of the restructuring scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the significant changes I have made to the milk quota regime, this year is unique in that it represents a transition period from one regime to another and therefore the rules for this <Col N="1055" /> year's restructuring scheme had to be framed accordingly.</P>

      <P>More than 416,000 cattle were exported from Ireland in 1999, an increase of more than 245,000 over the previous year. This year also looks set to be a record year, with live exports running at almost 207,000 to 21 May compared with 144,000 in the same period last year. I am satisfied there is sufficient shipping capacity available to meet current demands.</P>
      <P>As regards the future, my Department will continue to support the further development of existing outlets and the gaining of access to new markets. In addition it will continue to facilitate the carriage of livestock to our markets in Europe and the Middle East, by processing applications for the approval of livestock ships as expeditiously as possible, while ensuring that these vessels are capable of transporting live animals in acceptable conditions. In the long-term, strict adherence by all concerned to the standards set by my Department for vessels transporting cattle to overseas markets will help to preserve the future of live exports and the livelihoods of livestock farmers in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 17 dedicated livestock vessels approved under the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Orders, 1996 and 1998, with a total capacity in excess of 23,400 cattle at 500 kilograms. One new vessel has been approved this year and a second has been given approval for a trial voyage, while three other vessels are at various stages in the inspection process. I am also optimistic that a new roll-on roll-off service will commence shortly. If this service <Col N="1057" /> proceeds there will once again be three roll-on roll-off vessels available to transport livestock from Ireland to the continent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the 1998 Finance Act reduced the amount that a company could raise under the BES from £1 million to £250,000. The limit was reduced to refocus the relief on start-up/smaller companies which may find it hard to raise finance elsewhere. This was the orig<Col N="1058" /> inal intention of the BES. It was also done to reduce the growing cost of the relief to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the cost of a helicopter emergency medical service would, in all likelihood, far exceed the BES company limit.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, while every effort is made to publicise the availability of tax relief for unreimbursed medical expenses, they will, however, look at ways of improving the take-up of the relief.</P>
      <P>Greater publicity will be given to the existence of the relief in a targeted way. For example, it should be possible to make appropriate leaflets and posters available in hospitals, health board premises, doctors' surgeries and public libraries. The use of Aertel and of Revenue's internet site will also be looked at. Greater prominence will be given to the relief in the PAYE information leaflet that issues with tax-free allowance certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the issue of a form Med 1 to all PAYE taxpayers as suggested by the Deputy is not a practical proposition. The cost of carrying out this exercise would be significant as the form would have to be issued to some 1.8 million PAYE taxpayers. Given that 56,000 PAYE taxpayers already claim the relief and that 1,164,000 persons or 31.4% of the population are covered by medical cards, a general issue of the form to the entire PAYE workforce is not considered necessary. It is likely that the unexpected receipt of the form in many households would create confusion and lead to unnecessary contact with the PAYE tax offices. In many cases the taxpayer would contact the tax office only to find out that <Col N="1059" /> he or she had no entitlement to any health expenses relief.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Deputy has raised a valid point and the Revenue Commissioners will follow it up in the manner outlined above.</P>

      <P>The regulations covering the urban renewal scheme are a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The tax reliefs for the areas and sub-areas designated under the 1998 urban renewal scheme are as set out in section 372 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The scheme provides for capital allowances of 100% in respect of qualifying construction or refurbishment expenditure incurred on qualifying commercial buildings and capital allowances of up to 100% in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of qualifying industrial buildings. In the case of lessors the relief is written off at 50% in year one and the remainder at 4% per annum. Owner-occupiers can qualify for similar relief but can also avail of free depreciation of 50%, which allows the owner to defer writing off the year one allowance if they so wish. The scheme also provides for relief in respect of expenditure incurred on the refurbishment, conversion or construction of residential property. In the case of rented residential property, relief is available against all Irish rental income in respect of 100% of qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment, conversion or construction of qualifying property. Owner-occupiers can also avail of relief of 100% over ten years against all income in respect of qualifying refurbishment-conversion expenditure incurred on qualifying residential property. In the case of construction expenditure incurred on residential property, owner-occupiers are entitled to relief at 50% of the qualifying expenditure over ten years against all income.</P>

      <P>The candidate in question was assigned to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in Dublin as a result of a competition confined to former civil servants, which was held by the Civil Service Commissioners, but declined the offer of appointment. Had she taken up duty <Col N="1060" /> in Dublin, the location to which assignments from the competition were intended to be made, she could have applied for eventual transfer, after a minimum of two years, to County Sligo or County Leitrim under the central transfer scheme. It is expected that the Civil Service Commission will, at a later stage, hold an open competition for clerical officer positions, not only in Dublin but also in certain provincial areas. It is not, however, possible to say when such a competition may be held.</P>

    <P>However, transfers between relatives are at half the above rates. All parties must be blood relatives for this relief to apply.</P>
    <P>In addition, the transfer of an asset is regarded as a disposal at market value for capital gains tax purposes regardless of what, if any, consideration is received in return. However, there is an exemption from CGT for the disposal of an individual's principal private residence or part thereof. Should the home, or part thereof, be transferred by way of an inheritance, then neither CGT nor stamp duty would apply.</P>
    <P>The transfer of a home among members of a family is considered a gift or inheritance for capital acquisitions tax purposes. A tax-free threshold of £300,000 now applies on transfers from a parent to a child. CAT would only be levied on the value of the house, if any, in excess of this threshold. Where a child has received previous gifts or inheritances since 2 December 1988 from a parent, the value of these benefits must be taken into account for the purposes of determining the current, if any, liability to CAT. In addition, in the budget 2000, I introduced a family home relief for CAT purposes. This relief provides that the transfer of a home will be exempt from CAT provided that the home is the principal private residence of the recipient and he/she has been living in the home for the three years prior to the transfer and he/she does not have an interest in any other residential property. The recipient must own and reside in the house for six years after the transfer or the relief may be withdrawn. However, this six year condition will not apply to recipients over 55 years of age and in circumstances where the recipient is unable to comply with the residence requirement for reasons outside their control, for example, due to hospitalisation or work obligations. In addition, where the recipient sells the home within the six years and invests some or all of the proceeds in a replacement home and continuously occupies both homes for a total period of six out of the seven years commencing on the date of the transfer, the clawback of the relief will be limited to any proceeds not reinvested in the replacement home. Where a CAT liability arises in any event and CGT has been paid by the disponer on the same event, then that amount of CGT is allowed as a credit against the CAT liability.</P>
    <P>There may be a probate tax liability if the transfer of the home takes place on death. Pro<Col N="1062" /> bate tax is generally charged at a rate of 2% on the net value of non-exempt assets left by a deceased, whether the assets pass under a will or intestacy. However estates with a taxable value of £40,000 or less are exempt from probate tax. Outstanding debts of the deceased, as well as funeral expenses, may be deducted as expenses of the estate in arriving at the taxable value. In addition, a dwelling house passing to a dependent child or dependent relative is exempt from probate tax provided the dependent child or relative had been residing in the dwelling house at the death of the deceased and had an income not exceeding the specified amount for the tax year 1999-2000 the specified amount was £4,848. To qualify as a dependent child, the child must have been under the age of 18 years, or if over 18 years, in full-time education. To qualify as a dependent relative, the person concerned must have been a relative of the deceased or of the wife or husband of the deceased, who was incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or the widowed father or mother, whether or not he or she was so incapacitated of the deceased or of the wife or husband of the deceased.</P>
    <P>There would normally be other costs involved in a transfer of property, for example, solicitors fees. I am not aware of increases in non-tax charges as this does not fall within my area of responsibility. My Department would have no role in performing any legal work in connection with the transfer of a family home.</P>

      <P>Section 47 of the Freedom of Information Act obliges public bodies to charge a requester in respect of the granting of an FOI request unless the cost of collecting and accounting for the fee would outweigh the fee itself. The principal charges currently in operation are: £16.50 per hour for search and retrieval of records and 3p per copy of a record made. However where records contain personal information relating to the requester, a fee must be disregarded by the public body unless the request encompasses a significant number of records. The Act also allows a public body to waive all or part of a fee after having regard to the means of the requester. There are further protections in the Act for the requester in terms of minimising costs; in particular, section 47(8)(a) allows a requester to ask the public body to specify the amendments, if any, to the request which would have the effect of reducing or eliminating the fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a report undertaken by the group of civil service users of the FOI Act, which has been laid <Col N="1063" /> before both Houses, a number of changes are recommended to the existing charges regime. It should be emphasised that the report's recommendations in this area are aimed at improving the operation of the Act from the point of view of both requester and public body. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, has already indicated that there are aspects of the recommendations which he would not favour in their current form. No decisions have yet been made in relation to this issue, and the Government will have full regard to the views already expressed by Oireachtas Members when it decides the matter.</P>

      <P>The guidelines in respect of the INTERREG III Community Initiative 2000-2006 were issued by the European Commission at the end of April this year. INTERREG III programmes must be submitted to the European Commission within six months of the publication of the guidelines &ndash; by the end of October 2000. INTERREG III programmes will not become operational until the European Commission formally approves the INTERREG programmes submitted. As the Commission may take some time to do this, INTERREG III programmes are unlikely to be operational before the beginning of 2001. In the meantime a consultation process on Ireland's INTERREG III programmes is being organised and seminars are taking place in June as part of this process. The seminar on the INTERREG III programme for Ireland-Northern Ireland is taking place in Monaghan on 21 June.</P>
      <P>As regards the peace and reconciliation programme, following an extensive consultation process, a joint North-South draft Peace II programme document was submitted to the European Commission in early April. As the Commission must first approve the community support frameworks for Ireland and Northern Ireland, it is now expected that approval of the new peace programme by the European Commission will not be forthcoming before October this year. Because the new programme will utilise some of the implementation mechanisms from the earlier peace and reconciliation programme, inquiries and any preliminary work necessary to the appraisal of projects will be ongoing. However the peace II programme will be made fully operational from the time it is approved by the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will know that the peace and Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programmes are now the responsibility of the special EU programmes body which has an office in <Col N="1064" /> Monaghan and which will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>

      <P>Directive 97/52/EC amended existing EU directives on procedures for the award of contracts by public bodies to bring them into conformity with the Government procurement agreement [GPA] of the World Trade Organisation. The directive was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 13 October 1997 and member states were required to transpose its provisions into national legislation by 13 October 1998.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the directive were transposed into Irish law by statutory instruments signed on 2 October 1998 and particulars of transposition were forwarded to the European Commission. All Departments and offices were circulated with copies of the new directive by the Department of Finance and its principal features were outlined with particular reference to the need for compliance. The revisions to the EU public procurement regime arising from Directive 97/52/EC were relatively minor. The most important were, reduced value thresholds for mandatory advertising in the EU Journal of service contracts being placed by Departments, greater provision for de-briefing of unsuccessful tenderers and additional obligations on public bodies in regard to providing statistics on their procurement.</P>
      <P>A corresponding directive, 98/04/EC amended the EU directive on procedures for the award of contracts by entities operating in the utilities sector (water, transport, energy and telecommunications) to bring them into conformity with the GPA.

Its provisions were transposed into Irish law by the due date, 16 February 1999, and particulars of transposition notified to the European Commission as required.</P>

      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance continues to be provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>Contacts regarding the provision of a dedicated air ambulance service are ongoing with all interested parties involved with a view to developing a consensus on the most appropriate role for air ambulance in the overall context of pre-hospital care. I am continuing to provide additional funding for pre-hospital care with funding of more than £10 million in 2000. This is the largest annual amount ever provided for the development of the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge that an air ambulance service is only one element of an effective emergency medical care system. Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service in 1993, approximately £33 million has been provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations with well over half this funding being provided by this Government. This has resulted in major improvements in the service, including the training of ambulance personnel; the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet; the development of command and control centres; the opening of additional ambulance stations; and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas on a pilot basis to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
      <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the recent report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service falls to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement appropriately other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency response resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes were merged into one new drugs payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit on 1 July 1999. The new scheme effectively merges the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to be more streamlined, user-friendly and significantly improves the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. The drugs payment scheme, unlike the GMS scheme, is not means tested and is open to everyone.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will wish to know that the Government decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement was introduced over a three year period which began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for persons over 70 years, which were already higher than the normal guidelines, have been increased by two-thirds in the past two years and the balance will be added in 2001. While income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility for a medical card, the boards have regard to all the circumstances of the applicant. Accordingly, even though a person's income may exceed the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of the arrangements in place with regard to income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for older people, I have no plans at present to change the structure of the drugs payment scheme.</P>

      <P>In the first instance, I wish to point out that, in a private health insurance context, the structure of private hospital charges and medical consultants' fees are the product of commercial negotiations between service providers and insurers. I have no function in that process.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the importance of cost effectiveness in the private health insurance business, which was addressed in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance. It is ultimately a matter for individual insurers to determine the best arrangements for management of their claims costs having regard to prevailing commercial and competitive considerations. Specifically in relation to the VHI, the powers of the Minister, as set out in the VHI Acts 1957 to 1998, do not extend to commercial arrangements or day-to-day operational matters.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced that from 1 January 2001, nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses to continue to work in our public health service for a period of up to two years after the completion of the degree course. This fees initiative will continue until at least the year 2005, at an estimated additional annual cost of £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> As this initiative will apply from next year, nurses who commence part-time degree courses before then are outside the scope of it. However, it is open to such nurses to apply to their employers for financial support towards their fees. The main health agencies have continuing nurse education budgets out of which they may provide financial assistance to nurses undertaking post-registration education programmes.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the provision of services at Beaumont Hospital is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the waiting time for tonsil removals in the South-Eastern Health Board Region at Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford is between three and four years; his views on whether this delay causes serious damage to the health of the person waiting; and the plans he has to cut back on this delay.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of medical treatment in this instance is the statutory responsibility of the South-Eastern Health Board. In-patient waiting list statistics are routinely collected by my Department. There were 235 patients waiting ENT procedures including tonsillectomies at 31 March 2000. In relation to the waiting list position in the south east region, the board has advised me that any patient who requires urgent medical treatment will be provided with that treatment as a matter of priority. I am sure the Deputy will be aware that the prioritisation of medical treatment is a matter for the consultant concerned in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the waiting list initiative I have provided funding of £1.5 million to the board this year to <Col N="1072" /> carry out additional waiting list activity. I have also recently allocated a further sum of £475,000 under the initiative, aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable additional waiting list procedures to be performed. I understand from the board that this funding will be used to perform additional ENT, orthopaedic and ophthalmology procedures. The board has also committed itself to an in-depth review of all patients awaiting treatment in their hospitals and an examination of the length of waiting lists and waiting times to ensure greater access to hospital services in the South-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I have announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding is being allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the substantial additional resources provided to the South-Eastern Health Board under the waiting list initiative coupled with the review being carried out by the board and the additional ENT procedures will show a marked improvement in the waiting lists in the south east region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about a number of issues which arise from the increasing cost of settlements in cases where infants have suffered serious brain injury at, or around, the time of birth. In the first instance I am concerned at the rate of increase in the quantum of damages awarded in cases where negligence is established or where settlements are made before cases go to court. I am also aware of cases where it has not been possible to establish that any negligence occurred but nonetheless parents are faced with the challenge of caring for severely injured babies. The needs of the children are similar in all these cases and it seems unfair that the provision of the financial resources to care for them should be dependent on proving negligence on the part of a hospital or its medical and nursing staff. I am also aware of the fact that in these very lengthy and complex cases the legal costs associated with the claims sometimes exceed the damages awarded.</P>
      <P>A further concern is that this small group of cases distort the overall cost of providing medical indemnity cover for doctors. Despite the fact that it can cost up to £70,000 a year to provide medical indemnity cover for one obstetrician, it is a fact that doctors in other specialties are paying higher subscriptions in order to keep the obstetric rate at its present level. This situation is hardly sustainable in the long-term. I also have a concern that the high cost of obstetric medical negligence claims may make it unattractive to young doctors who may otherwise have been considering a career in that discipline.</P>
      <P>For these and other reasons my Department has been exploring the possibility of introducing a &ldquo;needs based&rdquo; or &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme for such cases. Similar schemes elsewhere have been examined and initial discussions have been held with interested parties here. However the introduction of such a scheme raises a number of constitutional legal and financial issues which need further study. The Government has asked that specific consideration be given to the implications of introducing such a scheme in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Irish Medicines Board plays an impartial role in the regulation of the distribution and sale of herbal medicinal products in Ireland. The Irish Medicines Board has recently published its three year strategic plan which outlines the board's philosophy in relation to all medicinal products including herbal medicinal products. Implicit in this philosophy is the board's total impartiality in its actions.</P>
      <P>I am further satisfied that the Irish Medicines Board has expertise in herbal medicinal products. I should add also that my Department has recently sanctioned the appointment of an additional senior assessor by the Irish Medicines Board to facilitate a detailed review of the arrangements to be put in place for the introduction of an interim licensing scheme for &ldquo;traditional and alternative&rdquo; medicinal products. This assessor, titled &ldquo;Project Manager &ndash; Herbal Medicines&rdquo; is required to be a graduate in the medical, biological or pharmaceutical area with a demonstrated knowledge of herbal medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to confine the distribution and sale of St. John's Wort to prescription-only control was made following the recommendation of the Irish Medicines Board in the matter. A number of reasons were given by the board for its recommendation. These included the fact that the products containing St. John's Wort appear to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, MAOIs. These <Col N="1076" /> products must therefore be used with particular care because of risks of interactions, not just with other medicines, but also with certain foods. Patients, therefore, may be at risk from hypertension if these products are taken with certain other antidepressants, over-the-counter cough mixtures and foods rich in tyramine such as cheese, yeast extract and red wine. Side effects such as photosensitivity, gastro-intestinal disturbances, fatigue and nervousness have also been reported. In addition, the board was particularly concerned that St. John's Wort was being widely advertised for the treatment of depression and openly sold in many outlets for this purpose. The board considered that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self-diagnosis and self-medication were inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the making of the regulations which confined St. John's Wort to prescription control, with effect from 1 January 2000, a number of other national regulatory authorities have also issued warnings in regard to this product, including the Food and Drugs Administration in the United States, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency of the European Union, and the Medicines Control Agency in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>A European wide alert in relation to admission to hospitals in Glasgow of 20 injecting drug users in the two weeks ending 15 May was issued through the National Disease Surveillance Centre in Dublin to the departments of public health in health boards. Nine of the 20 people died and others were admitted to intensive care units. The illnesses that were caused appeared to be related to injecting heroin into tissues which caused severe damage, with a rapid deterioration in health over a number of days, which developed into a septic shock syndrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> The Eastern Regional Health Authority passed the information on to the chief executives of A &amp; E hospitals, for the attention of all staff and to GPs. Staff are being asked to report back to the area health boards with any relevant information. In addition, notices have gone out to all drug treatment clinics, health centres, GPs and the general public advising drug users of the need for extreme care and vigilance as there may be contaminated heroin in circulation. A freephone helpline, operating 24 hours, seven days per week has been set up offering advice to heroin misusers and information and referral to treatment centres. The ERHA is also advising drug users who notice an adverse reaction to immediately seek help.</P>
    <P>Since the middle of April 2000 15 injecting heroin users have been confirmed with illnesses which meet the case definition of injecting drug user with evidence of a severe inflammatory process. Of the 15 cases eight have died. Four of the 15 cases and two of those who died are women. The ERHA is working closely with the authorities in Glasgow, the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta to isolate and identify the exact cause of the illness but to date no definite cause has been established.</P>
    <P>The three area health boards are expanding their services to meet the increased demand for such services. This includes the placement of additional outreach workers in high risk areas and increased treatment capacity at a number of locations including James's Street, Crumlin, and Finglas.</P>

    <P>The average waiting time for assessment in the Southern Health Board region has been reducing and is currently estimated at 18 months. In June 1999 following the publication of the report, Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures, additional funding was allocated to the health boards on the basis of the waiting lists at December 1998. Some £108,000 was allocated to the Southern Health Board. On the basis of the waiting lists at September 1999 the board was allocated an additional £113,000 for this year.</P>
    <P>The additional funding has been used to recruit additional social workers and administrative staff. The number of social workers has increased from 3.5 to 9.5. In addition, the board has improved office accommodation and administrative supports have been put in place. The board anticipates that as a result of these measures an ongoing reduction in the waiting time for assessment will be achieved. I am satisfied that the measures already taken by the board and the increase in the number of assessments per social worker arising from the new assessment model will result in a continued increase in the number of assessments being completed in the board this year.</P>

      <P>The circumstances which exist in the United Kingdom, which enabled the Medicines Control Agency to require the use of special labelling for medicinal products containing St. John's Wort, do not exist in this country.</P>
      <P>In the case of medicinal products that are the subject of product authorisations, it is a function of the Irish Medicines Board to be satisfied in regard to the labelling of such products and of the warnings and precautionary statements which should appear in regard to their use. In the absence of the necessary product authorisations in respect of medicinal products containing St. John's Wort, the board would not be in a position to address its public health concerns by way of labelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent debate has highlighted the lack of a common approach at EU level to the regulation of traditional medicinal products. While this matter is being addressed by a working group set up by the EU pharmaceutical committee last year, I do not anticipate an early resolution to the difficulties of harmonisation in this area. I have therefore asked officials of my Department and the Irish Medicines Board to investigate the possibility of an interim solution to the problem in the form of a simplified licensing scheme for traditional and alternative medicinal products which <Col N="1081" /> would allow such products to be lawfully marketed in this country.</P>
    <P>My Department has also sanctioned the appointment of an additional senior assessor by the Irish Medicines Board to facilitate a detailed review of the arrangements to be put in place for the introduction of such a scheme. This assessor, titled, Project Manager &ndash; Herbal Medicines, is required to be a graduate in the medical, biological or pharmaceutical area with a demonstrated knowledge of herbal medicines.</P>

      <P>The capital priorities of the Southern Health Board under the National Development Plan, 2000-06, including those relating to Tralee General Hospital, are a matter in the first instance for the board. My Department recently confirmed with the board overall funding for the duration of the plan. The national development plan priorities for the Southern Health Board were unanimously adopted at a board meeting held on 2 May, 2000.</P>
      <P>As part of a major initiative under the national development plan, I recently made available to the board a sum of £8 million for this year for re-equipment and refurbishment in health facilities in the board's area. I understand from the board that a portion of this funding will be directed to Tralee General Hospital.</P>
      <P>In relation to the acute hospital sector, there are already a number of projects within my Department's approved capital programme for the Southern Health Board area, including new classroom facilities for nursing staff at Tralee General Hospital. In addition, a number of developments planned for Cork University Hospital will improve key service facilities for patients in both the Cork and Kerry regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the national development plan, my Department recently agreed a sum of over £94 million for the acute hospital sector in the Southern Health Board region. This amount is expressed at 1999 prices. It is expected that it will <Col N="1085" /> be subject to adjustments for inflation under the plan.</P>
    <P>Individual capital projects coming on-stream over the life of the national development plan will remain subject to the normal criteria governing projects such as individual project approvals, agreed costings, construction start dates, and progressing projects in the light of the board's overall capital priorities at any particular time.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts, 1844 and 1863, provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. This project will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country by improving the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes. It will also provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to the assertion in the Deputy's question there are not 30 vacancies in the staff complement of the General Register Office in Joyce House and efforts are being made to fill such vacancies as exist. The General Register Office has not implemented any policy restricting access to its indexes. The recent improvements to the pub<Col N="1086" /> lic reading room were introduced in the interests of the proper management of the office, equality of service to its customers and the protection of its records. The room has been refurbished and extended and new shelving has been installed to prevent accidental damage to the indexes and to minimise the risk of personal injuries while removing and replacing indexes on the shelves.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate the importance of ensuring that a complete and updated copy of the indexes is available for conversion to an electronic format by the above-mentioned project in Roscommon. The copies of the indexes held in the General Register Office are continuously repaired, updated and amended to ensure that applicants are furnished with the correct record. The Deputy will appreciate that any microfilm copies of the indexes as may be available outside the general register office will not include all such amendments. I am not aware of any application by the National Library to An t-Árd Chláraitheoir for permission to obtain microfilm copy of any material held by the Church of Latter Day Saints.</P>
    <P>I might also mention, in relation to improvements in the services in the general register office that an additional staff member has been redeployed to the reading room to assist members of the public, particularly visitors from abroad and new users of the service, to answer their questions and provide them with the basic guide to searching indexes for a particular entry. The recent changes have not had any negative impact on access to the indexes, as evidenced by the increase in the number of searches applied for since the system was introduced.</P>
    <P>An tArd-Chláraitheoir is aware of the suggestions made by genealogical interests, some of which have been implemented. Other suggestions are being considered in the context of the review of the service to identify changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events.</P>

      <P>The specialist advisory committee in orthodontics and paediatric dentistry of the Joint Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry, a UK-Irish body, carried out a visitation of a number of the regional orthodontic units for the purpose of assessing their suitability for the provision of specialist training in orthodontics. The visit to St. Finbarr's Hospital took place on 24 April 1999.</P>
      <P>The members of the committee who visited Cork were Mr. P. A. Cook, Mr. J. K. Williams and Professor C. D. Stephens. Following this visit the committee wrote to the Southern Health Board and informed the relevant personnel that the programme at St. Finbarr's could not be approved for training purposes. The committee recognised that the regional orthodontic unit at St. Finbarr's offered potential for training but that this could only occur as part of a properly drawn up formal three-year training programme. Such a programme would have to incorporate the orthodontic department at a university dental school for the academic and didactic aspects of training. The committee gave detailed recommendations to the Southern Health Board to enable the board to improve its training facilities prior to any re-inspection.</P>
      <P>The committee noted that with only a single academic full-time in the orthodontic unit in Cork University dental school and Hospital, the resources for postgraduate training were limited and, therefore, recommended that until a further full-time senior academic orthodontist be appointed that no full-time trainees at Cork dental school be trained; the committee went on to recommend that once a senior full-time academic had been appointed, that the number of trainees could be increased. The committee also stated that the university dental schools must provide adequate documentation regarding academic timetables, course manuals and reading lists in line with other academic establishments.</P>
      <P>The number of patients who were being treated annually by the orthodontists in training prior to the visit by the specialist advisory committee is not available in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> I understand that Cork University Dental School and Hospital is currently in the process of filling a senior full-time academic post in orthodontics.</P>

      <P>The Smithfield area forms part of the historic area rejuvenation project, HARP, in Dublin for which funding is being provided by my Department under the Urban and Village Regeneration Measures of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development. In the period 1994-1999, a total of £5.563 million has been provided to Dublin Corporation to undertake a number of regeneration projects in the Smithfield area.</P>
      <P> In addition, under the various capital programmes operated by my Department significant financial support is provided to Dublin Corporation to implement a range of projects within and in the vicinity of the Smithfield area. These include: the non-national roads programme under which funding of £2.864 million is being provided in 2000 for the North King St. traffic management scheme; the remedial works programme in relation to the refurbishment of the Ormond Square flats at a cost of £1.375 million; the housing construction programme in relation to the redevelopment of the Marmion Court-Queen Street flat complex at an estimated cost of £12 million and the provision of 24 new local authority dwellings at Halston Street/North King Street at a cost of £2 million; and the special area regeneration programme under which St. Michan's House and Kevin Barry House are being upgraded.  </P>
      <P>The area has also benefited under the 1986 and 1994 urban renewal tax incentive schemes and a total of 26 sites in the area, which are identified in the HARP integrated area plan, are also designated under the 1999 urban renewal scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is not aware of any EU proposal in relation to the provision of pedestrian crossings.</P>
      <P>The provision of traffic management measures, including the provision of pedestrian crossings, is a matter for the relevant local road authority, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, and with the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads.</P>
      <P>Individual road authorities are directly responsible for the provision, maintenance and funding of signposting and roadway markings on non-national roads, either through their own resources and/or through discretionary grants made available by my Department. The initial selection and prioritisation of works under the various grant categories, including the provision and improvement of pedestrian crossings, are also matters for decision by individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>Non-national road grant funding has increased significantly in recent years from £174.8 million in 1997 to £263.74 million in 2000, an increase of 51%. It is intended that the substantial funding which is available together with local authorities' own resources should provide for the ongoing and special needs of local authorities with regard to the non-national road network.</P>
      <P>Funding is also made available by way of block grants to the National Roads Authority for the improvement and maintenance of national roads including the provision of safety facilities at schools located along the national road network. This involves the provision of school children signs, highlighted by flashing lights, which are activated as children enter or leave school.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the event is to promote sustainable approaches to urban transport, to highlight the adverse effects which cars can have on our urban environment in terms of air and noise pollution, to encourage and promote the use of public transport and alternative modes of transport, and to enable urban populations to rediscover and reclaim their urban environment. The charter provides a general outline of recommended measures, and participating areas may choose the most appropriate for local circumstances, such as setting aside areas for pedestrians, bicycles and public transport for the day; encouraging greater use of public transport; local co-ordination (for example, restricting times of trade deliveries); publicity; a safer urban environment for children; development of car sharing schemes; and preference for clean fuel vehicles. Suggestions are also made in relation to pre-, during, and post &ndash; event monitoring.</P>
      <P>I have written to each county borough corporation, the adjoining county councils and the relevant regional authorities encouraging their participation. The planning and organisation of participation is a matter for determination at local level, in consultation with key players such as the Garda, public transport operators, local traders, etc. I understand that Dublin, Cork and Limerick Corporations are committed to participating and that the matter is under active consideration in other areas.</P>

      <P>My Department has not operated a grant scheme for the conversion of existing heating systems to gas or oil in any of the restricted areas since 1990 where regulations have banned the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuels.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1990, limited grants, funded by my Department, were administered by Dublin Corporation in respect of the upgrading or conversion of certain heating systems reliant on bituminous coal in a small number of designated special control areas in Ballyfermot, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access to the grant scheme ceased in 1990 when regulations prohibiting the marketing, supply and distribution of bituminous fuels were made for the whole of Dublin. In 1991 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce made regulations, in the interests of greater safety, in <Col N="1094" /> relation to the quality of certain solid fuels. These regulations ensure that all smokeless fuels can readily be used in existing open fireplaces.</P>
    <P>The extensions of the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuels to Cork in 1995 and to Arklow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick and Wexford in 1998 were not accompanied by any grant scheme. I have no plans to introduce any such scheme in the new restricted areas of Waterford, Galway, Naas, Leixlip and Celbridge when the bans come into operation in October 2000.</P>
    <P>However, in order to assist lower income households with any increased cost of smokeless solid fuel, since 1990 the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs pays a supplementary fuel allowance of £3 per week during the winter heating season to people in receipt of the national fuel allowance payment and to other qualifying social welfare recipients in the restricted areas. This payment will also be provided in the five new restricted areas.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 2000, provide generally for the exercise by local authorities of key regulatory functions in relations to taxis and wheelchair accessible taxis, including the determination of new taxi numbers. While the Road Traffic (Public Services Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000, temporarily assign the determination of new taxi numbers in the Dublin taximeter area to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the grant of individual licences under this regime will remain a matter for Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, approximately 750 new wheelchair accessible taxi licences have been issued by Dublin Corporation. Some 500 further such licences are due to issue in the present year under the proposals announced by the Government in November 1999. By greatly increasing the overall stock of taxis operating in Dublin, these proposals are designed to cater better for all taxi users in the area, including of course providing improved service for persons with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Wheelchair accessible taxis are a separately licensed category, the licences for which are not interchangeable with or convertible into ordinary taxi licences. Persons operating such licences are obliged at all times to use vehicles conforming to the specifications for wheelchair accessible taxis. Supervision of the performance by taxi operators of the service requirements enjoined by regulations is generally a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>While the organisation and marketing of taxi services are in principle matters for the industry itself, I have indicated to taxi representative groups that my Department would consider giving support to the carrying out of an integrated study on desirable improvements in the quality of taxi service operations. My Department is also committed to providing assistance to Dublin Corporation in relation to a consultancy study on the feasibility of a centralised taxi booking service for Dublin; this study is now under way.</P>

      <P>Peter Bacon and Associates, economic consultants, were appointed by my Department earlier this year to evaluate and review measures taken by Government and other recent developments in relation to housing demand, housing supply and house prices and to review general housing market developments since the publication of Action on House Prices &ndash; April 1998 &ndash; and Action on the Housing Market &ndash; March 1999. These consultants were first appointed to review developments in the housing market in November 1997, following full open public advertising and tendering procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of completion by the consultants of An Economic Assessment of recent house price Developments &ndash; April 1998 &ndash; there was agreement that further work would be carried out as necessary in reviewing developments in the housing market, and a report, entitled The Housing Market: An Economic Review and Assessment, was produced by the consultants in March 1999. On this occasion, a single tendering procedure was followed as it was considered that the current project was closely linked with previous studies on house prices, that Peter Bacon and Associates were the most suitable consultants in view of <Col N="1096" /> expertise gained from previous studies and that there would be benefits in maintaining continuity.</P>
    <P>The consultancy fee for the study is £49,610 inclusive of VAT. The study will be completed shortly and will be considered by Government, together with a comprehensive policy response, as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <P>There are acknowledged difficulties in relation to the widespread mandatory requirement of seat belts in buses. Consequently EU and national regulations at present address the fitting of seat belts only in new minibuses, i.e. passenger vehicles with seating for more than eight persons excluding the driver and with a design gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3,500kg.</P>
      <P>Current national regulations require the fitting of seat belts in all forward facing front seats in such vehicles, where these have been first registered on or after 1 January 1992. Where these seat belts are required to be fitted, passengers using the front seats are obliged to wear them.</P>
      <P>EU Directive 96/36/EC permits members states from 1 October 1999 to require that all seating positions in new minibuses, as described above, are fitted with seat belts: vehicles designed to accommodate standing passengers are excluded. I have already stated that I will consider the question of adopting this requirement in the context of a consultation paper on wider issues of school bus safety which I intend to publish shortly.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, has been amended to include a new provision for the control of quarries over five years old. In accordance with section 251 of the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, quarries which are in existence since before the coming into operation of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, in October 1964 must register with the planning authority and may be required to undergo environmental impact assessment and apply for planning permission. This will only apply to quarries where the planning authority considers that the continued operation of the quarry would be likely to have significant effects on the environment and therefore not all quarries which have been in existence since before October 1964 will have to apply for planning permission. Officials <Col N="1098" /> from my Department have had discussions with the Irish Concrete Federation regarding a number of aspects of section 251 of the Bill and I am considering bringing forward some amendments to the section for Report Stage arising from these discussions.

      <P>A brief for a major extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to serve Westport, Newport, Mulranny, Murrisk and Louisburg, at an estimated cost of almost £21 million, was received in my Department in April, 1998. Mayo County Council was subsequently requested to review the proposals in light of the approval of water supply augmentation schemes for Newport and Mulranny under the serviced land initiative. Following this review, the council now intends to advance the proposal on a phased basis and has submitted a revised brief for phase I involving an extension from Shrah to Westport at an estimated cost of £7 million. This phase is fifth on the list of water supply schemes adopted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The extension to Louisburgh-Newport-Mulranny (which would include Murrisk, has been included in the list as a requirement for the post 2006 period. The priority lists will be taken into account in the framing of water services investment programmes for this and future years under the National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The analysis of the 1997 Living in Ireland Survey, mentioned by the Deputy, was recently highlighted in a report prepared in 1999 by the ESRI for the National Council on Ageing and Older People. Wide-ranging in its scope, the report examines the causal effects of poverty and social deprivation among older people through a variety of dimensions and, as such, it is a valuable addition to the body of research on issues relating to the needs of our older people. It covers the period from 1987 to 1997 and, therefore, provides an informative, historical analysis for policy makers.</P>
      <P>As the report points out, in income terms the position of older people disimproved over the ten year period covered. This is precisely why, on taking up office, the Government set ambitious goals in order to secure the future of our older people. Our Action Programme for the Millennium set a target old age pension rate of £100 by 2002. We are well on the way to achieving this with record increases in pensions rates over the last three budgets.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the maximum rate of the old age (contributory) pension at £78 per week equated to 28% of average industrial earnings. From May 5th, at £96.00 per week it equates to over 30% which is working towards the 34% recommendation of the Pensions Board in its report Securing Retirement Income.</P>
      <P>In last year's review of the programme, the Government committed itself to the early achievement of the £100 target for old age (contributory) pension and, furthermore, extended it to all social welfare old age pensions by 2002. In addition, over the lifetime of the Government, all old age pensions will increase in line with average industrial earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People report acknowledges the important role <Col N="1102" /> that the free schemes play in supporting the more vulnerable of our older people. From October this year, I have provided that entitlement to the free schemes will be extended to all people over 75 years of age regardless of the household income or composition. In addition, a review of the free schemes has been published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, and copies have been made available to Members of both Houses.</P>
    <P>I will examine this report in detail in the context of future budgetary policy. In particular, I intend to build on the improvements in this area by moving towards the establishment of a single household benefits scheme in future budgets. This will amalgamate the free electricity, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance into one combined household benefits package based on the standard living alone qualifying criteria.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides an opportunity to develop new approaches to important strategic issues under consideration in the social inclusion area. The National Anti-Poverty Strategy is the Government's key policy document in relation to tackling poverty and social exclusion and it is proposed, under the programme, that the National Anti-Poverty Strategy will be updated and the underlying methodology reviewed and revised where appropriate. In particular, new targets will be considered under the themes of older people, as well as women's poverty, child poverty, health and housing/accommodation. This process will be completed during the first 18 months of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 165 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has, since 1994, operated the family and community services resource centre programme, the focus of which is to combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit. An evaluation of the work of these centres was published in 1997, a key recommendation of which was that funding of these centres <Col N="1103" /> should be mainstreamed by my Department. In addition, the Commission on the Family, in its final report, recommended that the pilot project of ten centres be expanded, to develop a national network of 100 centres in the ensuing four to five years.</P>
    <P>Having considered the outcome of the review and in order to implement the recommendations of the Commission on the Family, the Government allocated additional funding of £700,000 in 1998 to allow for the expansion of the programme by some 25 centres. A sum of £2.13 million was allocated to the programme in 1999 to facilitate a further expansion of the programme by some 20 centres. Significantly increased funding of £2.939 million is available to the programme this year, to allow for the inclusion of an additional 15 centres in 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department has made significant progress towards achieving the recommended 100 centres, with an additional 54 centres currently in receipt of funding or approved in principle for inclusion in the programme since 1997, bringing the total number of family and community centres to 64. I recognise the vital role these centres play in providing support for marginalised families and in combating poverty and social exclusion and my commitment to support such initiatives is shown by the significant increase in funding made available to the programme in recent years.</P>
    <P>The national development plan provides for expansion of the programme by some 15 centres per year of the plan with a total funding allocation in excess of £18 million over the period of the plan. This funding is part of an overall funding commitment of some £100 million made available over the period of the national development plan to support and expand my Department's community development support programmes which include a community development programme; a family and community services resource centre programme; and a programme of core-funding to locally-based community and   family support groups.</P>
    <P>I am confident this funding will enable my Department to achieve the recommendations of the Commission on the Family, to establish a national network of 100 family and community centres, within the specified timeframe of four to five years.</P>
    <P>There are currently 775 persons in receipt of a back to work allowance, who were previously in receipt of a one parent family payment. According to my Department's records, 97% of those currently in receipt of one parent family payment are female. This percentage, when applied to those on back to work allowance would indicate a figure of 752 female one parent families in receipt of a back to work allowance.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not possible to indicate the number of one parent families who have availed of the back to work allowance since its inception as the statistical data recording system does not facilitate the recording of data in this manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1999, the number of appeals received in the social welfare appeals office was 15,465, representing an increase of</P>
      <P>over 10% on the number &ndash; 14,014 &ndash; received in 1998. So far this year the rate of increase has accelerated, with receipts for the first five months showing an increase of 20% over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The average time taken to process appeals determined during 1999 was 21 weeks. This average has been maintained during the first four months of 2000 despite the increase in appeals received. The average period given includes all phases of appeals including the additional time involved in the determination of appeals where, for example, further investigations have to be made or where adjournments have been sought by the appellant or by the legal representative acting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration. There is an inevitable time-lag inherent in such a process which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>
      <P>In some cases appeals can be dealt with on the basis of information supplied by the appellant and the Department's deciding officer without recourse to an oral hearing and these take less than the average time.  Where an oral hearing is required, however, an additional delay is inevitable. While processing times in the social welfare appeals office compare favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of further improvement in these times is a major objective of the office. However, at all times it is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is not in conflict with or at a cost to the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits. To cope with the extra demands being made on the appeals process, earlier this year I made two additional appointments, bringing the number of appeals officers to 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Family Mediation Service is a State funded, professional, confidential service which enables couples, who have decided to separate or who have already separated, to negotiate their own separation agreement in a non-adversarial way. Family mediation aims to assist couples to reach agreement on all issues in relation to their separation including financial provision, the family home and property and parenting arrangements for the children so that ongoing close relationships with both parents are made possible for the children.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years the Family Mediation Service has been radically expanded throughout the country in line with the Government commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to establish a nation-wide service. The service is available from centres in Cork, Tralee, Wexford, Athlone, Dundalk, Galway, Tallaght in west Dublin and the Castlebar centre which opened its doors in January 2000. These new centres are in addition to the Limerick and Dublin centres. The latter has been relocated to larger premises to deal with an expansion in the number of clients. Last year more than 1,000 couples were assisted by the Family Mediation Service. I now plan to establish the service on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The expansion of the Family Mediation Service to the north west of the country so that the people of Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal have ready access to this important service continues to be a high priority for my Department. The Family Mediation Service has recently advertised for mediators to serve in various locations of the country and I am hopeful that a suitably qualified family mediator for the north west will come forward through this process.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I have brought forward the commencement of the Castlebar service and pending the establishment of a service for the north west couples are advised to contact this centre at Family Mediation Service, Family Centre, Chapel Street, Castlebar, County Mayo, Telephone (091) 509730.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs' grants schemes concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work. These grant schemes are aimed at developing people and their capacity to participate in society, rather than at the provision of services or at direct economic development or job creation initiatives.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Navan branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association has applied for funding of £4,000 under the year 2000 scheme of grants for community development, education and training, towards the cost of training its members to participate in their local branches and committees. All applications under this scheme are currently being processed by my regional office in Dundalk. As the Deputy can appreciate, it will take some time to process these applications, but my Department will be in touch with the Irish Wheelchair Association as soon as a decision has been made regarding their application.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have considerations made into approving an old age contributory pension for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo based on his five years self-employment, in view of the fact that the only reason he did not pay PRSI for two of the years in question was that the revenue legislation at the time did not warrant it, and the Department did not advise him of the ultimate effect this would have on his pension entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for <Col N="1107" /> receipt of an old age (contributory) pension is that a person must have entered insurance before the age of 56. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961. Its purpose is to link entitlement to pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.</P>
      <P>The person concerned paid social insurance contributions for the first time in the 1990-1 tax year at which stage he was 57 years of age. His income for tax purposes has been assessed by the Revenue Commissioners at less than £2,500 in each of the two preceding years, i.e. 1988-9 and 1989-90. In the circumstances contributions are not payable under the legislation in respect of those years. He could not, therefore, satisfy the condition requiring entry into insurance before age 56.</P>
      <P>A special half-rate old age (contributory) pension was introduced from April 1999 for self-employment persons who were age 56 or over in April 1988 when the self-employed became liable to pay insurance contributions. He does not qualify for this pension, however, as he was under age 56 at that time and does not, in any event, have the required 260 contributions which are also needed to qualify for this pension.</P>
      <P>In March 2000, the person concerned qualified for a <i>pro rata</i> pension from my Department in accordance with the bilateral agreement on social security which this country has with the USA. Under this agreement, insurance contributions paid in Ireland and the USA may be combined to give entitlement to pension at a pro-rata rate. He qualified for this pension from the date he reached age 66 in July 1998. This pension is currently being paid at the rate of £10.90 per week.</P>

      <P>My Department funds a number of community development support programmes namely; the community development programme; the family and community services resource centre programme; the programme of core funding to locally based community and <Col N="1108" /> family support groups, The purpose of these programmes is to provide seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs. The mutual aim of all programmes of support operated by my Department is to redress the process of exclusion which undermines local community structures and inhibits the ability of people in disadvantaged communities to participate in society.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for funding, groups must subscribe to a self-help community development ethos and must involve intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project.</P>
      <P>Community groups seeking funding under the various programmes of support are required to have an anti-poverty focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. In assessing applications received under the various schemes, my Department takes account of the extent to which each voluntary or community group, and the particular project for which funding is sought, addresses such poverty and exclusion. Many elderly persons benefit from projects funded by my Department, in particular those at risk of poverty and exclusion. The Department of Health and Children has specific responsibility for the provision of services to the elderly.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is <Col N="1110" /> to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997, 53,000 individuals have received assistance under the scheme. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society <Col N="1111" /> and, accordingly, a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
    <P>While the closing date for receipt of applications was 26 May 2000, the regional offices of my Department are flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>
    <P>The mid-west regional office of my Department has advised that an application has not been received on behalf of the individual referred to in the Deputy's question but that office can facilitate the individual by accepting an application at this stage should the individual wish to make one.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, individuals who wish to obtain assistance under the scheme, must do so by way of a voluntary organisation, such as community alert groups, neighbourhood watch groups, Muintir na Tíre, etc. I have arranged to supply details to the Deputy in relation to a local group who may be able to assist the individual in making an application.</P>

      <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers, known as IYV 2001. The year is designed to enhance recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteer service. The intended outcomes of the year are that more needs be identified with which volunteers can help; that more people everywhere offer their services as volunteers; and that volunteer programmes receive increased resources and facilities, to help them assign those new volunteers to tackling the needs.</P>
      <P>In such a year, all can gain. Individuals can find a renewed sense of purpose. Volunteer groups can be reinvigorated. Governments and the non-profit and private sectors can enter into fresh partnerships to make for greater participation, alleviate problems and promote good governance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN year of the volunteer will provide a focus for activity to support volunteering. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a national committee on volunteering will be established, with participation from relevant interests, which will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering. The <Col N="1112" /> committee will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the International Year, but for the longer term.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be putting the arrangements in place to set up this committee and issues of structures, staffing and finance will be examined as part of this process. I know that various organisations involved in volunteering have already met to discuss how to make the most of IYV 2001. A number of organisations have already submitted suggestions to my Department in relation to projects that they would like to have promoted during the year. All of these submissions will be made available to the national committee on volunteering to assist it in its work.</P>

      <QRef>[16019/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998 my Department received an application from St. Michael's Family Life Centre, Sligo, seeking inclusion in the family and community services resource centre programme. An application seeking inclusion in the programme was also received at that time from a second group in Sligo. Having considered both applications my Department considered that neither centre nor application met the Department's criteria in full for inclusion in the programme. The Department was also concerned that both centres were based in the same ward in Sligo and were targeting families in the same catchment area.</P>
      <P>Officers of my Department met with representatives of both groups and outlined the difficulties with the applications, that is, possible duplication of activities/target area, no rationale for funding two centres in the same area, etc. As my Department's concern is to ensure that the needs of disadvantaged families are met in the most appropriate manner, rather than deciding between competing applications, the Department suggested that both groups come together to identify and address the needs of the area and seek funding as one project. The groups, having considered this option, indicated that they were unable to co-operate in the manner outlined, with both centres indicating that they wished to pursue separate applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation was further complicated when the Department received applications from two additional groups, operating in the same area, also seeking funding under the Department's pro<Col N="1113" /> grammes, bringing to four the total number of applications from that area. My Department was also aware that a fifth project based in the area was also addressing family support needs and was participating in the Springboard project operated by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In an effort to find a solution to the situation my Department met with the local health board to consider how best both agencies could support groups in the area who were providing for family support needs. However, following further consideration of the matter it became apparent that, taking into account the resources available to both agencies, it would not be possible to support all the groups in the area. In assessing applications under my Department's programmes it is essential to ensure that funding is targeted to address the needs of the most marginalised and vulnerable families and to ensure that any project selected for funding is the most appropriate project to provide for these support needs and that it does so without duplicating the services and support provided by other groups.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in order to ensure that the needs of disadvantaged families in Sligo town are addressed in the most appropriate manner, I recently approved the commissioning of research to consider the needs of Sligo town in terms of family support; to recommend on the establishment of one resource centre for the town; to recommend where this centre should be based with a view to addressing the areas of most need, taking into account the need for any such centre to be accessible to the community it would service and to recommend on an appropriate organisational structure for the centre.</P>
    <P>I expect this research to commence shortly and the applications received from St. Michael's Family Centre and from the other groups in the area will be made available to the researchers to consider in the context of the work they are undertaking. I am satisfied that undertaking this research will ensure that my Department is in a position to address, in the most appropriate way, the support needs of the most disadvantaged families in Sligo town.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals his Department has in relation to doubling of the child benefit in respect of twins in a family, in view of the added financial hardship on such families.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set out the position in relation to the issue of child benefit  &ndash; CB &ndash; entitlements and multiple births on a number of occasions to the House in the past. The position is that, prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, CB was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> In the case of twins, CB was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
    <P>I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998 in fulfilment of our pre-election commitments. First, the rate of CB payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal CB rate; second, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. These measures took effect in September 1998 at a full-year cost of £4.8 million.</P>
    <P>In the interim, I have also provided for substantial additional investments in the CB scheme. The 1999 budget provided for an additional full year investment in the scheme of over £40 million, while last December's budget provides for a full-year investment of almost £106 million. From September of this year, the basic CB monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including, of course, families with twins and represent, in my view, the most effective use of the available resources. The cost of providing for the double CB payments for twins is estimated at £5.5 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Cork Corporation is currently the only local authority in which an archaeologist is co-funded by my Department. A number of other local authorities retain the services of archaeologists, not all of whom are involved in planning. These are Dublin Corporation, Cork County Council, Limerick County Council, Limerick Corporation and Mayo County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> My Department is in correspondence with the Department of the Environment and Local Government in regard to the employment by local authorities of archaeologists. At the same time, I am looking at a repositioning of the archaeological services in my Department to see how these can best complement the activities of the local authorities in this area. My Department also raised this issue with the County Managers' Association in December 1999, but no response has been received to date.</P>
    <P>This approach will encourage local authorities to take a more direct interest in the protection of their own archaeological heritage, thereby providing a more efficient and effective management of the archaeological resource. The appointments which have been made to date have not only acted to provide advice and assistance to local authorities and developers on proposals for new developments in a more &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; way but they have been very successful in heightening awareness of the existence of and the need to protect sites of archaeological interest.</P>

However there is a national monuments division within my Department that is responsible for the protection and preservation of our national monuments. When damage to a recorded monument is reported, my officials investigate the matter and a prosecution under the National Monuments Acts may ensue, if appropriate.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have similar responsibility under the National Monuments Act as my own Department in relation to the protection of our built heritage.</P>

      <P>Tullaherin round tower which is in State ownership is inspected on a regular basis. Routine maintenance at nominal cost <Col N="1117" /> is carried out, as required. I am aware that there are significant cracks in the masonry and bulging at the base of the tower. An engineer from my Department inspected the tower in 1994 and again in 1999 and photographic evidence does not show any obvious deterioration between the two inspections.</P>
      <P>Following recent advertisements for stone masons in local and national newspapers it is hoped that my Department will be in a position to recruit skilled workers which will allow it to carry out repairs at this site and also at other sites where I have given a commitment to a programme of works.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate the cost of repairs until the preliminary work of cleaning of vegetation, scaffolding and clearing out the inside of the tower is complete. This will allow a more detailed assessment of the structural condition of the tower and the measures required to conserve it.</P>

The general rules with regard to the collection, processing, keeping, use and disclosure of personal data are provided in section 2 of the Data Protection Act, 1988.

While the Act does not contain any provisions specifically relating to questions in application forms, certain questions may be found to be directly or indirectly discriminatory: for example, questions relating to marital status or age may constitute discrimination under the relevant grounds.</P>

      <P>The height requirements for applicants to the Garda Síochána are prescribed <Col N="1119" /> in the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, as amended). At present, the minimum height requirements for male and female applicants are 5'9&rdquo; and 5'5&rdquo;, respectively. The requirements governing admissions and appointments are the subject of regular review. The particular requirements in relation to height were last changed in 1977 when the minimum height requirement for males was restored to 5'9&rdquo;, having been reduced to 5'8&rdquo; in 1972. Consideration was given to again reducing the minimum height requirement for males in 1981 but it was decided to maintain the existing requirement.</P>
      <P>I have some concerns about the appropriateness of the height requirements in the context of current best practice in recruitment and I believe that it is right to question them in a balanced and objective manner.

      <P>It is not general practice to comment publicly on individual applications for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence with the expectation by the applicant that such confidence will be preserved.</P>
      <P>However, the position in this instance is that the applicant was interviewed on 10 August 1998 and it was decided that he does not qualify as a refugee in accordance with the definition contained in the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees as amended by the 1967 protocol and as defined in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996. A refugee is defined as a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P>
      <P>The applicant appealed the decision to refuse him refugee status. On 12 May 1999 his appeal was heard by an independent appeal authority. On 28 June 1999 the applicant was refused on appeal and he was informed accordingly.</P>

      <P>The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and I, as a member of the Executive, am precluded from intervening directly.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, provides in section 4 for the creation of a new offence related to the possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more for the purpose of sale or supply. It provides in section 5 that the court shall, in imposing sentence, specify a minimum period of imprisonment to be served of not less than ten years upon conviction for the offence. Section 5 also provides, however, that a court is entitled to depart from the imposition of the minimum sentence where there are exceptional and specific circumstances relating to the offence or the person convicted of the offence which would make it unjust in all the circumstances to impose the minimum ten year sentence. Factors to which the court may have regard in this respect include whether the person pleaded guilty, and, if so, the stage at which the person indicated the intention to plead guilty and the circumstances in which the indication was given, and whether the person materially assisted the investigation of the offence.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Act has been in force only since 26 May last year. I will, however, continue to monitor the operation of these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the judge to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he/she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused. Our system of recruitment to all levels <Col N="1121" /> of the Judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in experienced and trained legal practitioners and, consequently, judges, on appointment, who have a wide knowledge of the law and its application. In so far as consistency of sentencing is concerned, it is important to mention that the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply to the court for a review of what appears to the director to be an unduly lenient sentence.</P>
    <P>The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission which specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. Its report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Courts Officers Act, 1995, enable me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, this year, I made £206,000 available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. I understand that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, makes provision for meetings of District Court Judges to discuss, <i>inter alia,</i> the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar provision in the case of other courts, I understand they hold similar meetings.</P>
    <P>The Sixth Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission also made reference to the issue of sentencing. The working group suggests that judicial education could be addressed by a judicial standards body in liaison with the Judicial Studies Institute. This new body could, <i>inter alia,</i> provide a monitoring and analytical service on matters such as sentencing along the lines of the Judicial Commission in New South Wales. The Chief Justice established a judicial committee to consider,<i> inter alia,</i> the recommendations made in the working group report and the judicial committee has met on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>I am currently preparing proposals for Government on Mr. Wilson's recommendations and I hope to finalise these shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the child care measure under the regional operational programme of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 which provides £250 million to invest in the development of child care service provision. The objectives of the programme are to increase the number of child care facilities, increase the number of child care places and improve the quality of child care services in Ireland. Funding will be provided under the following initiatives: capital grants for community groups and not-for-profit organisations for the establishment, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities; staffing grants to support staffing costs for community based child care facilities; for the first time, capital grants for self employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time, to build, renovate or upgrade child care facilities; grants towards the development of local child care networks; grants to enhance the services of the national voluntary child care organisations; grants to encourage and promote local child care training models that assist in the enhancement of quality child care provision; and innovative projects identified over the course of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>On 28 April I launched the capital and staffing grant measures. They were also advertised during the same week in the national and provincial newspapers. My Department has received over 3,000 requests for application forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, further funding has been provided <Col N="1126" /> to other Departments with a role in the development of the child care sector. The Department of Education and Science now has a budget of £5 million per annum to invest in grants to school managements to develop after-school child care services in school premises together with £74 million over the life of the national development plan for early childhood education which will fund areas such as curriculum development, parental guidelines for children aged from birth to three years and targeting provision for children aged three to four years with a particular focus on children with special needs and disadvantaged children. The Department also has a budget of over £2 million for a scheme which supports the child care costs of participants in VTOS, Youthreach and senior traveller programmes.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has an annual allocation of £5 million to support the provision of out-of-school hours child care services in disadvantaged communities. It is proposed that the £5 million funding will mainly be made available to the projects funded under the Community Development Support Programmes CDSP, viz: community development programme; family and community services resource centre programme; core-funded community and family support groups programme; and other local initiatives which subscribe to a self-help, community development ethos in tackling issues of poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the spirit of partnership which informs the way in which these community development programmes are managed in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, a working group representative of the local community development groups themselves and other interests and expertise in the child care area has been set up to advise on the detailed design and implementation of this child care scheme.</P>
    <P>A circular has issued to all the projects funded under the community development support programmes inviting applications for the out-of-school hours funding. There will be three separate rounds of funding with closing dates for receipt of completed application as follows: &ndash; 26 May 2000,: 30 June 2000 and 22 September 2000. I understand that to date 35 applications have been received for the first round of funding and the working group will meet to assess these applications later this month.</P>
    <P>A separate circular on the scheme will be prepared shortly by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for other local initiatives, not currently funded under the Community Development Support Programmes, who wish to apply for funding under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs' out-of-school hours child care services scheme.</P>
    <P>The additional allocation of £5 million for the out-of-school hours services will greatly enhance the child care work being provided by the community development support programmes and <Col N="1127" /> will also make provision for the extension of this excellent scheme out to other local initiatives which subscribe to a self-help, community development ethos in tackling issues of poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The role of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, in child care relates to the implementation of the Child Care (Pre-school Services) Regulations, 1996 which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991. The regulations provide for notification to and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, child minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age. A review of the regulations will be initiated in 2000 and this will take place in the context of the other developments which have occurred since the regulations were introduced.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services. I understand that the health boards provide a range of advice and assistance to pre-school providers at all stages of the notification and inspection process. Many of the boards also maintain close liaison with the national voluntary child care organisations and other relevant local agencies who are involved in providing advice and assistance to pre-school providers. An additional £1.4 million has been made available to the Department this year to strengthen both the pre-school advisory and the inspection role of the health boards. This will facilitate health boards with the planned increase in the number of child care places.</P>
    <P>Health boards also provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, with regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and the provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.9 million, capital and revenue, was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999 and approximately 8,000 places were funded. An additional £1.75 million is being provided in 2000 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It was recognised early on that action had to be taken to increase the supply of child care places. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, provided a number of tax reliefs to encourage the provision of crèche facilities and increase the supply of places in the 1999 and 2000 Finance Acts.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Finance Act introduced capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child care premises <Col N="1128" /> which meet the required standards as set out in the Child Care Act, 1991. These allowances were improved in this year's Finance Act. For expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999, 100% capital allowances are allowable in year one. The relief applies to all child care facilities whether provided by employers or commercial child care operators and the reliefs can be used by owners of the facilities or by investors who wish to invest by way of leasing arrangements, subject to the normal tax rules which apply to such investors.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Finance Act also provided an exemption from a benefit-in-kind charge where employers provide free or subsidised child care for their employees. The exemption applies where the employer makes a premises available or, if a joint scheme, is involved in both the management and financing of the child care facility.</P>
    <P>A booklet is being prepared by my Department which will give information on the range of funding that is available from all Government Departments. It is my intention to make this booklet available on my Department's website and from the equal opportunities child care section of my Department shortly.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, published draft guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities on 17 May 2000. The Minister has informed me that the draft guidelines are intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for child care facilities. They will also assist planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans. The Minister has also informed me that the draft guidelines, do not, however, relate to child minding, which is generally a small-scale, home-based economic activity and which does not generally require planning permission.</P>
    <P>The draft guidelines have been issued for a two month public consultation period until 21 July 2000. All interested parties have been invited to submit any comments they may have to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and I have been informed that all submissions received will be taken into consideration before a final version of the guidelines issues as soon as possible thereafter. In view of the urgency of the need for additional child care facilities, local authorities have been asked to take the draft guidelines on board from now on both in reviewing development plans and in exercising planning control functions. I am informed, however, that these guidelines relate solely to the land use planning aspects of child care provision.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure that those with child care budget lines work together to ensure an integrated approach to the future development of child care using our resources most effectively. To facilitate the development of policy at an interdepartmental level and at the <Col N="1129" /> level of implementation my Department will be leading the co-ordination of child care service delivery over the course of the national development plan which involves the establishment of structures at national and local levels involving the key stakeholders including an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, to focus on co-operation and co-ordination between Government Departments and State agencies with a role in child care; a national co-ordinating child care committee, chaired by my Department, to oversee the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country; and county child care committees to advance child care service provision at local levels.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has taken on the role of vice-chair in the committees at national level. The establishment of county child care committees will be facilitated by the relevant health boards and will operate under guidelines which are currently being developed by the national co-ordinating child care committee.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new structures will provide a forum for consultation and the sharing of expertise which will benefit the future development of the child care sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the Deputy in reply to Questions Nos. 50 and 264 on 18 April 2000, the Irish tourism industry has benefited from a substantial round of capital investment, undertaken with the support of the 1989-93 and 1994-99 EU co-funded Operational Programmes for Tourism. This investment, totalling £739 million, has assisted in the upgrading of existing facilities and the addition of new ones, and has been across a wide range of facilities, whose existence has assisted in no small way in the growth and maintenance of visitor numbers.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, an impressive expansion of tourist accommodation over the same period has resulted in increased competition and higher standards across all categories.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that levels and standards of facilities in the tourism industry have improved, there is no room for complacency. That is why in my discussions with the industry I continue to emphasise the need for maintaining high standards in order to meet the needs of our discerning overseas visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure that our tourism product continues to keep pace with, if not ahead of our international competitors, I have secured £100 million under the national development plan for tourism product development over the next seven years. This will be allocated under the two regional operational programmes. These two programmes also include funds under the aegis of other Ministers for areas such as marine leisure, angling and <Col N="1132" /> rural tourism, which will benefit the sector, while expenditure in the cultural development and micro-enterprise areas will also support the development of tourism product. The strategy for tourism product development under the programmes will be based on the needs of areas, having regard to whether they are developed, developing or undeveloped.</P>
    <P>One of the main priorities for funding will be to support investment in a small number of strategically located major new attractions where none currently exist and also in the packaging, presentation and, where necessary, completion of a limited number of significant clusters of attractions in less developed tourist areas which have the potential to generate greater foreign tourism revenue and stimulate private investment in the provision of further tourist services.</P>
    <P>However, tourism cannot be developed in isolation. Investment in non-national roads, rural water supply, waste management and litter control are essential to the strategy of facilitating the expansion of tourism into more remote areas and maintaining a sustainable tourism product in more developed areas. If the relevant local and other authorities do not deliver the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls, it will be difficult to successfully realise our national tourism strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2000 was widely advertised and over 1,600 applications were received by the closing date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applications are being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form. The criteria are as follows: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport-recreational sport and-or result in <Col N="1133" /> improved standards of sporting performance; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, that is, does the project comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities; the financial viability of the project, that is, in addition to lottery funding, has the club-organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe; the level of local funding available; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, as defined by ADM Limited's indicators, and the current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements/facility in relation to the club-organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the NGB.</P>
    <P>I intend to announce the 2000 grant allocations at the earliest possible date following completion of this assessment process under way in my Department. Until the assessment has been completed, it is not possible to indicate which projects in County Kildare will be awarded grants under this years programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>A report commissioned by CERT and published last year entitled, Hospitality 2000, quantified the expected skills requirements of the tourism industry up to 2005. This report highlighted two major challenges facing the industry, namely the recruitment of new entrants and the retention and development of existing staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this report was published CERT has been working with the industry to address the challenges set out in the report. Implementation of the recommendations will require the industry to commit additional resources to develop and retain valuable staff and find ways to achieve <Col N="1134" /> excellence and improve productivity with the same number or with fewer people.</P>
    <P>CERT is continuing to promote recruitment to the industry through a variety of strategic interventions which, to date, have proved important in maintaining recruitment numbers to formal craft level training. The main objective of these interventions is to highlight to young people, those returning to work and other categories of potential employees, the advantages of a career in a fast growing successful industry.</P>
    <P>Recently, I launched CERT's new nationwide programme to encourage people who have been out of the workforce for a long time to take up a career in the tourism industry. This follows on from another scheme launched in May 1999 in Ballymun, targeted at long-term unemployed blackspots, which has proved very popular and successful, with participants being virtually guaranteed jobs on successful completion of the courses.</P>
    <P>Under the new national development plan, my Department will continue to work closely with CERT to refine its activities in the future and to further develop the measures to be taken to help address the requirements of the industry in an increasingly competitive labour market.</P>
    <P>Each year CERT organises a major recruitment campaign throughout the country. These campaigns are implemented in partnership with all the major industry bodies including the Irish Hotels Federation, Restaurants Association of Ireland, Vintners' Federation of Ireland, and the Licensed Vintners' Association and are targeted at second level students from transition year to leaving certificate level. They include the very successful national careers roadshow which is supported by a major media and advertising campaign. As part of this roadshow, personnel from the main employer bodies attend and give first hand experience of work in the industry and, in the case of IHF members, this usually involves tours of their premises. CERT also attends the main career exhibitions, together with representatives of the IHF and RAI.</P>
    <P>Finally, I understand that tourism employers have also participated in recruitment fairs in Wales and Scotland, which have proved very successful in attracting staff to Ireland, and that they expect to participate further in focused recruitment in England, France, Spain, Sweden, Finland and Greece. Irish participation in fairs such as these is co-ordinated by FÁS, which welcomes employers to participate with them at these fairs. I understand that the Irish Hotels Federation, Irish hotel groups and individual hotels are also participating in EURES, the European Employment Service, to help satisfy labour supply in the hospitality sector.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that a number of private sector recruitment agencies are actively engaged in recruiting workers from overseas for employment in the hospitality industry.</P>

      <P>One of the functions of the Irish Sports Council, which was established as a statutory body on 1 July 1999, is to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to co-ordinate their implementation by all the bodies involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the strategic planning of swimming pools, I fully agree that the provision of swimming facilities must be done in a planned and focused manner. However, it is the responsibility of each local authority to identify the specific <Col N="1136" /> swimming requirements of their area and to formulate proposals based on these needs.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, funding for the refurbishment and provision of local authority swimming pools has been increased from £3 million per annum to £15 million per annum for the three years 2000-02. Prior to securing this additional funding, my Department commissioned ILAM (Ireland) to prepare a report on the condition of local authority pools built between 1966 and 1981. Thirty pools around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment and the relevant local authorities have been invited to submit proposals to refurbish these pools.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware the Education (Welfare) Bill is currently being discussed by the Dáil. I hope the Bill may be enacted during the present session. Initial planning for the implementation of the Bill is under way in my Department.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and for the deployment of educational welfare officers. These officers will support schools, students and parents in tackling the problems causing non-attendance and will promote and support regular school attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for a nationwide educational welfare officer service for all schools. All schools <Col N="1142" /> can and will benefit from the service of an educational welfare officer. However, in line with policy generally within my Department, it is my intention that the first priority in the deployment of the educational welfare officers will be towards meeting the needs of disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the information supplied with regard to the circumstances of a school (details supplied) in County Dublin, he will grant the retention of the tenth assistant post on a concession basis for one year from 1 September 2000 to June 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15886/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing <Col N="1144" /> schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
    <P>The current staffing of this school is a principal and ten mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 274 as at 30 September 1998. The school also has the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>The enrolment as at 30 September 1999 &ndash; on which the staffing for the 2000-01 school year is based &ndash; was 264. Under the staffing schedule, this enrolment entitles the school to nine mainstream class teachers. The enrolment requirement for the retention of the tenth teacher is 270. Unfortunately, despite the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, I cannot authorise the retention of the post.</P>
    <P>If the board of management of the school is confident that the enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 will be in excess of 289 pupils they may apply to the primary payments branch of my Department for the allocation of a teaching post under developing school criteria.</P>
    <P>The details regarding the granting of a teaching post under the developing school status are outlined in circular 11/00 which my Department issued to the board of management of the school recently.</P>

Increments are granted annually subject to service being satisfactory. Primary teachers who complete a three year recognised training course are placed on first appointment on the second point of the scale, £15,487, and those who complete a four year recognised training course are placed on the third point of the scale, £16,018.</P>
    <P>The annual rate of salary payable to temporary unqualified persons employed in primary schools is £13,212. Increments are not awarded to persons who are deemed to be unqualified.</P>

      <P>The planning and steering group for the Irish Academy for the Performing Arts was set up on 27 January 2000, in order to develop, advise on, facilitate and monitor the process of establishing the proposed Academy for the Performing Arts.</P>
      <P>The steering group is chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former President of Dublin City University. It has representatives drawn from my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority, third level institutions, the Arts Council and bodies providing professional education and training in music, dance and drama. There are no vacancies on the steering group. The question of filling any vacancies will be addressed if and when a vacancy arises.</P>
      <P>In approving the establishment of the proposed Academy for the Performing Arts, the Government agreed on a structure incorporating a headquarters and significant facilities on a site to be provided on the DCU campus; a Limerick campus developing the existing Irish World Music Centre at UL; and an undergraduate professional dance facility based at the Firkin Crane Dance Development Agency in Cork.</P>
      <P>As part of its work the steering group is to make proposals about the longer term possibility of transferring elements of other educational bodies in the fields of music and drama to the academy and the facilities required and of incorporating other disciplines to make it a fully multi-disciplinary institution.</P>
      <P>The steering group will consult widely with interested parties as part of its work and it will of course be open to Waterford Institute of Technology to participate in this consultation process.</P>

      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will bring forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this process, the educational research centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including the school to which the Deputy refers. Work on analysis of the responses from schools is nearing completion and the results will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every school, including the school in question.</P>
      <P>Based on the levels of need identified, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions which will ensure that disadvantaged children receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system. These interventions will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered as part of this process.</P>

      <P>I understand that the student referred to by the Deputy was awarded the adjacent rate of maintenance grant by County Laois VEC under the terms of the 1997 European Social Fund aided third level maintenance grant scheme for trainees to pursue a course of study at Carlow Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the ESF aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees, maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. The vocational education committee decides the rate applicable in each particular case. Except in the case of mature students, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant-holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. As the distance from the college in this <Col N="1149" /> particular case is less than 15 miles, the student was correctly awarded the adjacent rate of grant which, for the 1999-00 academic year, is £676.</P>
    <P>The value of the maintenance grant for students has increased in recent years in line with inflation. This approach ensures that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. Considerations are ongoing on the allocation for initiatives under this fund. I am not yet in a position to convey details about the allocation of the funding. However, I can confirm that any additional direct financial supports to disadvantaged students will be made available in the course of the 2000-01 academic year.</P>

      <P>My Department may grant special leave under the terms of Rule 116 of the rules for national schools to enable permanent teachers attend a course of study for a minimum duration of one academic year. Before such leave can be granted, the applicant must have received the <Col N="1150" /> approval of his-her board of management, and my Department must be satisfied that the course involved is demonstrably relevant to teaching in the primary sector. My Department continues to pay the salary of the teacher, but the employment and payment of a fully qualified substitute teacher for the duration of the course is the responsibility of the applicant.</P>
      <P>My Department also grants special leave to practising remedial teachers who attend approved remedial courses held annually in six different centres. Such teachers are allowed leave of absence as necessary to facilitate their attendance at these courses.</P>
      <P>Teachers who are involved in teaching in special schools or classes, and resource teachers for pupils with special needs, may be granted leave of absence to attend a one year diploma in special education in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, which has been validated by my Department.

      <P>Since the course of study referred to by the Deputy has not been submitted for validation by my Department, I am not in a position to comment on its content, or on its value to the pupils of those who undertake the course. Neither can my Department grant continuation of salary payments and the cost of substitution as requested by the Deputy.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently, a three-year multi-sectoral programme costing £193 million forms the core feature of my commitment to addressing the needs of people who are at risk of, or who are experiencing, educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The implementation of this programme at primary school level entails a survey of all primary schools to identify the level of concentration in each school of pupils who have background characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. In March 2000 my Department commissioned the Educational Research Centre, ERC, Drumcondra, to conduct this survey. A questionnaire for schools was developed by staff of the ERC in consultation with officials of my Department. Since the criteria used to select schools for the Breaking the Cycle project have been shown to be valid indicators of educational disadvantage, the current questionnaire draws on the analyses of applications and other data from that project and on the wider research literature.</P>
      <P>The current questionnaire sought information from schools about the various socio-economic indicators that have been found to be associated with educational disadvantage. These include unemployment, possession of a medical card and residence in local authority housing. The questionnaire also includes items relating to early school leaving and low achievement in literacy and numeracy among senior pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and the educational research centre were conscious of the fact that completing the questionnaire would be a very demanding task for principal teachers. To reduce the burden, principals in large schools were asked to answer the questions in relation to one grade only which, for reasons of comparability of responses, had to be specified in the questionnaire. The most senior grade level was chosen because of the importance of getting information on early school leaving. This focus is based on clear evidence that, with few excep<Col N="1152" /> tions, the socio-economic composition of schools tends to be very stable. Therefore, I do not accept that the survey is biased in its focus on sixth class in the case of the larger schools. However, it is planned to carry out some follow-up work on the survey and the issues raised in the question will be further examined in that context.</P>
    <P>More than 70% of schools returned completed questionnaires and staff at the educational research centre have just completed its initial analysis. I propose to allocate additional staff and other financial resources for 2000-01 to schools where the survey indicates both significant levels of socio-economic disadvantage among their enrolment and also a clear need for the resources. Further analysis of the questionnaire data will also be undertaken in the context of a wider examination of procedures for identifying disadvantage. This examination and any consequent refinement of school selection procedures will inform the allocation of resources for 2001-02 school year and for subsequent years.</P>

I understand that the school is currently considering applications for enrolment in the pre-school class for the coming school year and that an application for enrolment of the child in question will be considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I would be most <Col N="1154" /> anxious that no parent of a child with special needs, including autism, should find it necessary to resort to legal action to secure their child's entitlement to an education service. In this connection, I would point out that in November 1998 my Department announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Arising from this development, special dedicated provision is now made available for such children in primary schools at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Each special class also has the support of a child care assistant. To date, more than 50 special classes have been established to provide dedicated educational support for children with autism and my Department is currently pursuing the establishment of additional classes in a number of locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The recently published White Paper on Early Childhood Education sets out the proposed framework for the future development of early education services, including services for children with special needs. My Department has recently completed a range of discussions with interested parties in relation to service development in the early childhood education area and proposals to advance the measures set out in the White Paper are now being considered.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently announced my intention to establish a task force on autism to examine models of provision for children with this condition and to make recommendations for the future development of services in this area. The question of the suitability of a range of models of provision, including that pursued under the I Can Do project, will be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have information on the number of pre-school children with autism currently seeking educational placement.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme and the vocational education scholarship scheme, operated under the aegis of my Department, financial assistance by way of maintenance grant and a grant towards lecture fees is provided to eligible students attending approved postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The amount of lecture fees payable under these schemes is subject to a maximum fee limit approved by the Minister for Education and Science. The maximum fee limit for the 1999-2000 academic year is IR£2,891 Where students, attending approved courses qualify for assistance towards tuition fees the fees are paid directly by the local authority or VEC to the college on receipt of an invoice from the college. In the case of students pursuing their studies in colleges in Northern Ireland, the value of the grant towards fees is converted into sterling at the prevailing exchange rate and this amount is paid to the college. Any remaining balance must be paid by the student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1996, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. <Col N="1158" /> Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements are equitable and efficient. While I appreciate the current exchange rate difficulties with sterling, I am not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the EU. Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

      <P>Queries on teacher qualifications at primary level and second level are currently dealt with by the primary administration section or the post-primary teachers' section of my Department, as appropriate. Both of these sections are located in my Department's offices in Athlone. There are staff within these sections who deal with such queries and I do not see the need for a hot line to complement the work of the sections.</P>
      <P>Teachers wishing to apply for recognition at primary level in this State are required to submit certain documentation to primary administration section so that my Department can properly assess their qualifications. Delays in processing such applications can be caused by insufficient information being supplied to my Department, which results in my Department requesting further information from the applicant.</P>
      <P>At second level, the registration council is a statutorily constituted body which prescribes the conditions for registration as a secondary teacher, including the conditions relating to qualifications. The qualification requirements for the purposes of teaching in vocational, community and comprehensive schools are determined by my Department. Applications for recognition of a particular qualification must be submitted to the secretariat of the registration council or my Department, as appropriate. Assuming that adequate information is submitted, an assessment of the qualification in question is carried out and a decision as to its acceptability is taken as speedily as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following clarification I understand the Deputy's question refers to class size rather than classroom size.</P>
      <P>The average class size in primary schools in Dublin in the 1998-99 school year was 27.1 pupils per class. The national average class size was 25.6 pupils per class.</P>
      <P>The higher average class size in Dublin schools is due mainly to the fact that the staffing schedule which determines the allocation of teacher posts is designed to ensure that schools with multi-grade classes have more favourable class sizes. Since multi-grade classes are more prevalent in small rural schools than in large urban centres, it is inevitable that the average class size would be greater in the major cities.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the pupil-teacher ratio, has been reduced significantly in recent years. In the current school year the PTR is 20.4. The retention of the posts arising from the demographic dividend for the current school year will further reduce the PTR.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I am allocating an additional 200 teaching posts at primary level for the 2000-01 school year, primarily to tackle educational disadvantage. Furthermore, under the programme for prosperity and fairness, an additional 900 teaching posts will be created at primary level, which will further reduce the PTR over the period of the programme.</P>

      <P>In the current school year at second level the ratio is of the order of 15.1:1. The creation of 1,000 additional teaching posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in a further reduction in the actual pupil teacher ratio in the sector next year.</P>

      <P>My Department's involvement in the area of pre-school education currently involves the provision of infant classes in national schools and support for a range of initiatives aimed at <Col N="1162" /> children who are disadvantaged and children who have special needs.</P>
      <P>Pre-school provision for the coming school year, other than infants classes in primary schools, will include the early start pre-school pilot programme, catering for a maximum of 1,650 children; the Rutland Street pre-school project, catering for up to 95 children; 52 pre-schools for Travellers catering for up to 520 Traveller children; and pilot pre-school provision for autistic children, catering for a maximum of 24 children.</P>
      <P>In addition, some 644 pre-school children avail of all-day child care under the child care measure provided by vocational education committees to support access of unemployed and early school leaver parents to VTOS, youthreach and traveller programmes.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education &ldquo;Ready to Learn&rdquo; sets out a blueprint for the development of the sector, with the aim of building on existing provision and assisting providers to raise quality of provision. Support will continue to be made available for the initiatives outlined above. In addition, the State may become involved in further direct provision in certain instances where the educational needs of the White Paper priority groups &ndash; disadvantaged children or children with special needs &ndash; are not being met by existing State-funded services.</P>
      <P>More generally, the White Paper also sets out a range of proposals designed to assist providers. These include the development of a quality in education mark to be awarded to providers who meet defined standards concerning matters such as curriculum and staff training. Supports will also be developed in a number of other areas including the production of materials and developmentally appropriate guidelines; research, development and dissemination of best practice; the provision of an advice, evaluation and inspection service; the development of a framework for qualifications and the provision of incentives for schools to make suitable premises available for pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper, is currently under way in my Department. A consultation process between my officials and parties with an interest in early childhood education is nearing completion. Detailed implementation of the White Paper proposals will be undertaken following the completion of the consultation and planning process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 and 271 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not compile statistics on the number of man-hours devoted to research in the third level sector. However, I understand that Forfás collects data on full time researchers in the higher education sector and I am arranging for this information to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research in the third level sector has been radically transformed by the joint public-private programme for research in third level institutions which was launched in November 1998. The main objectives of the programme are to promote the development of high quality research capabilities in third level institutions, so as to enhance the quality and relevance of graduate output and skills, and to enable a strategic and planned approach by third level institutions to the long-term development of their research capabilities. Awards under the programme are made follow<Col N="1164" /> ing a competitive process of international peer review and 11 successful institutions were awarded £162.5 million under cycle 1 of the programme in July 1999. Cycle 2 of the programme was launched in December 1999 and £65 million is being provided for the period 2000 to 2003. The national development plan includes provision for an investment of £550 million over the period 2000 to 2006 in research, technological development and innovation, RTDI. The precise annual allocation over the lifetime of the plan has yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>In relation to the increase in the demand for post doctorate researchers and for post-graduate research students at both masters and PhD levels, the expert group on future skills needs has noted that it is difficult to determine the precise level of increase over the level of activity in 1998 and 1999 because there will be some element of replacement involved where existing research personnel transfer to the new programmes. It has, however, estimated additional demand in this area and I am arranging for these estimates to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>A total of £1.2 billion has been allocated to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for RTDI for industrial development purposes. While it is not possible to set out with precise accuracy the allocation to higher education, a sum of around £25 million per annum, from the overall amount of £1.2 billion, is expected to be allocated to a national collaboration programme which will create networks involving companies and researchers in the third level sector.</P>
    <P>The overall allocation also includes a sum of £560 million for the setting up of a technology foresight fund. A dedicated research foundation, which will operate as a sub-board of Forfás, is being set up and will fund world class research projects in niche areas of information and communication technologies, ICT's, and biotechnology. This will be carried out on the basis of a competitive peer review process following a call for proposals for which higher education institutions can compete provided they satisfy the relevant criteria. A sum of £25 million has been allocated to the fund for 2000 and annual expenditure will increase significantly in subsequent years as the foundation establishes itself.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to forward to the Deputy information on contract research income in the university sector for the years 1993 to 1999 for which figures are readily available and contract research broken down by source of funds for the academic year 1996-97 which is the only year for which this information is readily available. This information is not readily available in the institute of technology sector. Research in both sectors is also funded by way of the annual core grant to these institutions.</P>
    <P>269. </P>
    <P>Mr. R. Bruton asked the Minister for Education and Science the financial supports currently made available to postgraduate students undertaking research under the programmes <Col N="1165" /> reported by agencies funded by his Department; and if he has conducted any assessment of the way in which this financial package compares to that available in the UK, in the USA and in continental Europe. [16088/00]</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority administers two programmes on behalf of my Department which involve support for post-graduate students.</P>
      <P>Under the programme for research at third level the support for postgraduate students ranges from £7,000 to £12,000 per annum and clusters around £8,000. In seeking funding under this programme institutions have the freedom to seek allocations at the level they consider appropriate.</P>
      <P>The council for the humanities and social sciences awards Government of Ireland scholarships of £8,000 per annum to post-graduate students in the humanities and social sciences.</P>
      <P>In the institute of technology sector, supports for post-graduate research programmes vary between approximately £4,200 and £7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has not conducted an assess<Col N="1166" /> ment on how this level of funding compares with such funding in other countries.</P>
    <P>I would also mention that postgraduate students can apply for fee and maintenance grant awards under the terms of the higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committees scholarships scheme.</P>
