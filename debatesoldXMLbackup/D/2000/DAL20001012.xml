      <P>The Government has promised proposals on institutional reform, reforming the Oireachtas, tribunals and the courts. In light of yesterday's events when will the Government produce its proposals, to ensure greater compliance and more effective enforcement of compliance by Members of the Oireachtas with decisions of the Oireachtas and of the tribunals and to strengthen the powers of tribunals so that they can deal much more quickly with people who do not co-operate with them, whether they be Members of the Oireachtas or others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding proposals for both Oireachtas and institutional reform, the Govern<Col N="2" /> ment had a number of discussions and the proposals are almost ready. However, with regard to the Oireachtas element of those proposals, there are also discussions between the Whips which I hope will lead to reform.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Whip informs me that there have not been any discussions between the Government side and this side of the House anyway, with regard to the Government's proposals for the Oireachtas. Is the Taoiseach aware that this gap between the public statements of Ministers and the reality of their inaction is leading to cynicism on this side of the House and outside the House, with regard to the Government's seriousness in this area? Fine Gael has tabled its proposals and will bring them before the House at an early date.</P>

      <P>If we are to achieve Dáil reform it has to be on an all-party basis. It would not work otherwise. In my experience over the past 20 years, I know that if reforms are not introduced on an all-party basis they will not be implemented.</P>

      <P>In view of the unprecedented joint statement which was published yesterday and signed by the party leaders on behalf of virtually all of the parties in this House, has the Taoiseach received any response from the former Fianna Fáil member, Deputy Liam Lawlor, to that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Constitution, we can make our own rules in this House. Would the Taoiseach agree that we need to change Standing Orders so that we can impose sanctions on Members who behave inappropriately in relation to tribunals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure covering that is already in Standing Orders. If the House sets up a tribunal giving it powers to take remedial action when somebody does not co-operate, as the Ceann Comhairle pointed out to the House, there are certain rules governing how the subject matter of statements on sitting tribunals established by the House under the Acts and under Standing Order 56 should be dealt with. They are set down in both Standing Orders and precedents. There were many long arguments and debates in the House on these issues and the precedents and the Standing Orders were based on these discussions. They were not lightly set up at the time and I do not see why we should try to undo them. Introducing reforms or new institutional matters, is a different matter for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach take into account that those who have been most noteworthy in not co-operating with tribunals are either present or former Members of this House, the House which set those tribunals up? Surely there is a very serious contradiction and conflict at the heart of the way in which we are dealing with that.</P>
      <P>On a separate matter, will the Taoiseach say what is the position with regard to the Government's proposals for decentralisation of Departments? This has been announced and withdrawn and there has been a process of expectation raising taking place throughout the country. Yet the Government has not delivered. What exactly is the Government's plan on this matter or does it have one?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that we make the House look ridiculous by going back <Col N="5" /> to 1947? The references I was making were to Mr. Haughey, to be precise, and Deputy Lawlor, both recent or current Members of the House who have not co-operated. It is very important that the House shows it is prepared to take steps towards enforcement in regard to its Members' compliance with the orders of tribunals, given that the tribunals are instruments of the House for finding fact and were set up by us. We must show the citizens that we are prepared to comply with the tribunals set up by us if we expect others to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I said what I did yesterday and why the House, when it set up the tribunal three years ago, gave it powers to act if somebody did not do co-operate. The point I made was that the ruling the Ceann Comhairle made some time ago during the current Dáil, was based, as the Chair said at the time, on the rulings and precedents, and my point is that those Standing Orders and precedents are there for good reason. They are based on the deliberations, experiences and facts of a long history of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In approximately six weeks from now the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill, the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill, will be deemed to have passed Second Stage as a result of a vote taken in the House earlier this year and I wonder what arrangements the Taoiseach has to ensure it makes effective and rapid progress to the relevant committee so the House can enact it and so we will no longer have the sad procession of politicians from the Fianna Fáil Party to the tribunals in Dublin Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, the heads of which were approved during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the Labour Party Bill <Col N="6" /> which, following the Taoiseach's footwork, he deemed to pass but did not pass. An unprecedented time lag was put on it whereby it was deemed to pass Second Stage, but that would not come into effect until 1 December. The Taoiseach's backbenchers may be somewhat surprised. This Bill concerns political donations and the Taoiseach has received advice that it might be unconstitutional, advice which has not yet been shared with the rest of us. I am giving the Taoiseach fair notice to make provision for it to be dealt with effectively by the relevant committee so we end the sordid scandal of tribunals in Dublin Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we can do that. I will mention some of the other Bills, along with those before the House, including the reform of the public offices commission. We are currently looking at the content of Bills published by Fine Gael and the Labour Party and at bringing in new legislation in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the Government's legislative position on the private rented sector? During the summer a commission recommended a new regulatory board for disputes and a new legal framework for leases for both tenants and landlords. It is not on any of the lists circulated by the Government. The Minister of State welcomed the report. Is it the intention to provide legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am indebted to the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal who has written to me stating that he intends to bring proposals to Government shortly with a programme for implementation arising out of the report of the commission on the private rented sector and that there are significant legislative implications. This significantly moves forward the Government position. It is a clear promise of legislation. In view of the grotesque exploitation which continues of those living in rented homes, flats and bedsits, will the Taoiseach give the Dáil a definitive timescale for the provision of legislation for security of tenure for those now at the mercy of grabbing landlords and for rent control which is a crucial necessity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal for writing to me on the same subject and indicating the information to which Deputy Higgins referred. When I asked the Tánaiste about the legislation on Tuesday she seemed to indicate that legislation would be forthcoming. It is important that the Taoiseach states categorically in the House whether the Government intends presenting legislation to regulate the private rented sector. It is required under the report of the commission on the private rented sector. The Taoiseach has been somewhat ambiguous when I asked about it on previous occasions, and this is <Col N="7" /> an opportunity for him to state categorically that the Government intends to bring forward legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Today the report is being discussed with the housing forum, as we promised would happen as soon as the report was published. Legislation will be required and that will be prepared. At this stage I am not sure how long that will take, but I categorically state that it will require legislation and that such legislation will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the multiplicity of financial services which are now being offered by banks, insurance companies and companies in the IFSC. In many circumstances, the consumer is at risk because there is no single regulator for the financial services industry. Why can the Taoiseach not succeed in getting the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance to agree on the policy for a single regulator? They are disagreeing on the report of a committee which was chaired by the Attorney General, Mr. McDowell. Must we wait for another Finbar Ross or Tony Taylor case before this Government takes action? The Ministers are at loggerheads for the past 18 months and the situation is an absolute scandal.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach previously informed the House that the Cabinet had instructed the relevant Ministers, namely the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, to introduce a joint memorandum to Government. That was more than 18 months ago. Does the Government have any sense of responsibility to consumers who are dealing with the financial services industry? We see daily examples of financial institutions, from the commercial banks down, failing to comply with the law or to co-operate with the Revenue Commissioners. Who will protect the consumer and when will that happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 6 provides that the protection for individuals against re-serving waiting periods on transferring between insurers shall not apply in the case of members of restricted membership undertakings which have decided not to participate in risk equalisation. An exception to this measure will apply where the person transferring is under 23 years of age. This will safeguard the position of dependants of members of such restricted membership undertakings who, under their rules, can no longer be covered on attaining a certain age.</P>
      <P>Section 9 substitutes section 12 of the 1994 Act which provides for risk equalisation arrangements between insurers. The main changes from the provisions made under the 1994 Act are that restricted membership undertakings will have an option in regard to participation in risk equalisation; the Health Insurance Authority will have a key role in determining the timing of the commencement of risk equalisation, that is, within a prescribed field of discretion related to levels of material instability in the reported risk profiles of competing insurers; arrangements for the making of representations to the authority or the Minister in relation to the commencement of risk equalisation; and new entrants to the market will have the option of availing of a three year exemption from risk equalisation transfers between insurance undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> Subsection (1) provides for the Minister to prescribe a scheme of risk equalisation which will set out the details relating to the conditions for its commencement and the terms of its operation. Subsection (2) addresses the undertakings to which any risk equalisation scheme will apply. It also provides for the established restricted membership undertakings to exercise a 'one off' choice to be permanently excluded from risk equalisation. The 1994 Act gave such undertakings an exemption from risk equalisation up to 30 June 1999. Subsection (3) maintains original provisions relating to arrangements for making statutory returns by insurers to the authority. It is the data contained in these returns which will be central to consideration of the commencement of risk equalisation and on the basis of which the magnitude of any transfers will be determined.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides for arrangements relating to the making of payments to the authority by insurance undertakings and by the authority to undertakings by reference to matters to be specified in the scheme. It also provides that the Minister shall determine the day when such arrangements are to have effect. In this regard the scheme shall require the authority to evaluate and analyse the returns made to it, prepare and furnish reports to the Minister and recommend, where conditions specified in the scheme are fulfilled, that the Minister ought or ought not exercise the power to determine that risk equalisation payments should commence. The subsection will enable the statutory scheme to provide that, up to a certain specified level of material instability in the risk profiles of insurers, the Minister may only authorise the commencement of risk equalisation transfers between insurers on foot of a recommendation to that effect from the authority. Beyond the specified level the Minister shall authorise such commencement unless there are good reasons for not doing so.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (5) the authority, if it considers that a recommendation to authorise the commencement of risk equalisation payments is warranted, shall inform each undertaking of its proposed recommendation. Each undertaking will be entitled to make representations concerning the recommendation and the authority must take account of such representations before deciding the recommendation to be included in its report to the Minister under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (6) a scheme shall require the Minister to inform registered undertakings of a proposed determination to commence risk equalisation arrangements. Undertakings will be entitled to make representations on why such a determination ought not to be made by the Minister and he or she shall take such representations into account before finally deciding whether to make the determination which would commence the process of risk equalisation payments between insurers.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) requires registered undertakings, when requested, to provide information or details to the authority relating to returns they <Col N="13" /> have made. It also provides that the Minister is entitled to specify the form of, and particulars to be included in, reports being made by the authority concerning its periodic evaluation and analysis of returns from insurers. Subsection 8 provides that registered undertakings which have made representations to the authority or the Minister relating to commencement of risk equalisation shall, when requested, provide information or documentation in support of their representations within a specified time.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) maintains the provision relating to the establishment and maintenance of a risk equalisation fund into which insurers would make payments to the authority and from which it would make payments to insurers. It also maintains provisions concerning the keeping of accounts relating to this fund by the authority. Subsection (10) provides that conditions to be set out under a scheme requiring the authority to make a recommendation in relation to commencement of risk equalisation can differ from conditions under which the Minister shall, unless there are good reasons for not doing so, commence risk equalisation. It also provides that these conditions can be expressed by reference to the amount which would be raised for payment in accordance with the terms of a scheme on account of the nature and distribution of insured risks amongst the undertakings.</P>
    <P>The effect of this subsection is to allow for a scheme to specify different trigger points based on the level of market instability evident from the differing risk profiles of competing insurers, as derived from the analysis of their respective returns to the authority. The capacity to set different triggers will enable a scheme to contain a significant field of discretion within which the commencement of risk equalisation can only occur on foot of a recommendation to that effect from the authority. The development of a higher level of instability will require the Minister to authorise the commencement of risk equalisation unless it appears to him or her that good reasons exist for not doing so.</P>
    <P>Section 9 also inserts a new section 12A in the 1994 Act. This new section enables the authority to disclose aggregate information derived from statutory returns made to it by insurers but provides that such data related to individual insurers may be disclosed only where necessary for the functions of the authority or the Minister. The intention is to enhance the transparency of the system and to assist the financial planning of insurers. It also includes original provisions enabling the Minister to retain professional advice in relation to his or her functions under a scheme and provides for the manner in which payments due to the authority under a scheme may be recovered.</P>
    <P>Section 10 inserts the option for insurers entering the market to avail of a three year exemption from risk equalisation from the date of commencement of health insurance business. The White Paper set out the need for an exemp<Col N="14" /> tion for new market entrants and stated that an 18 month period would be provided. However, it became apparent that a longer exemption period would be required with a view to attracting new entrants. The entry of additional insurers to the market would have the potential to yield significant benefits to consumers, in terms of competition on price, service and insured benefits available. However, to achieve this greater competitive state it is necessary to give practical recognition to the fact that, in order to establish itself with a reasonable prospect of sustainability, a new entrant to the health insurance sector faces considerable marketing, development and operational costs in competing with the two major insurers already operating here. The exemption will not apply to companies that are associated companies of registered undertakings already having availed of the exemption nor to new restricted membership undertakings.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with miscellaneous amendments such as changes consequent on the deletion of the definition of &ldquo;ancillary health services&rdquo;. Section 12 is a standard provision which gives the short title and collective citation and provides for the commencement date or dates to be appointed by ministerial order as considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>The proposed removal of ancillary health services from the regulatory framework has been carefully considered in the context of facilitating the development of insurance cover in this area. The proposal does not affect the existing eligibility arrangements for health services under which persons are given access to primary care services on the basis of need. It is aimed at giving people who fund their primary care needs on a &lsquo;pay as you go' basis the choice of financing their care by means of insurance.</P>
    <P>Under the 1994 Act the definition of a health insurance contract embraced ancillary health services and those associated with a hospital stay, whether in-patient or day-patient. Ancillary health services were defined as including out-patient, GP and dental care. All contracts, whether they provided ancillary cover only, hospital cover only or both, were required to observe the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. In practice, few contracts with anything other than a nominal level of ancillary cover have emerged and there are no contracts that provide full indemnity exclusively against the cost of these services, such as exist in respect of hospital in-patient services. It was considered that steps needed to be taken to encourage the development of new products to fill a clear gap in the market and bring a level of service and choice to the consumer which was not emerging as matters stood. Accordingly, under the provisions of the Bill, any new contracts which solely relate to indemnification against the cost of ancillary health services will not have to be community rated.</P>
    <P>The Government stated in the White Paper on private health insurance that the further evolution of private health insurance should include <Col N="15" /> steps to promote the position of primary care in the system. The relatively minor coverage of primary care in health insurance was seen as promoting an orientation towards most costly hospital based treatment by those with health insurance and it is desirable to address this. I hope that it will be possible for insurers to develop plans that will cover areas such as dental care and other health care services where consumers can be open to liability for sizeable expenditure. There is also the prospect that the new arrangements will provide scope for development of preventive and early detection services, which have not been a significant feature of insurance arrangements to date where the focus is on acute care. I have outlined the technical aspects of the Bill which allows for late entry loadings in circumstances to be prescribed. The proposals will impact positively upon those who hold health insurance and the health insurance market.</P>
    <P>The advisory group on risk equalisation forcefully indicated that if the flow of young healthy lives into the system was to taper off, the community rates insurers charge would be higher as they would be based on worsening risk profiles. This could have a compounding effect as the resulting higher premiums could cause young healthy people to question the value of their insurance and terminate their cover, thereby accelerating the premium increase spiral. The Government has, therefore, formed the view that there should be an incentive for those who will purchase health insurance at some stage during their lives to join the system at the earliest possible age. This is fairer than the current system because it will reward those who take out private health insurance, place an appropriate premium burden on those who enter health insurance later in life when the prospect of claiming benefits is higher and consistent with the general principle of community rating because a 70 year old person who originally joined the system at age 25 will still pay the same premium as a new entrant aged 25.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to introduce the principle of lifetime community rating. Under this principle insurers will be allowed to charge an extra premium in the form of a permitted percentage loading on their standard community rate to those who join private health insurance for the first time at an older age. For the reasons mentioned, this form of community rating is considered inherently more stable than the current system.</P>
    <P>The proposed arrangements aim to ensure late entrants will be liable to pay sufficient extra premiums to make up the surplus they would have contributed to the system if they joined at an earlier preferred age. Regulations to be made pursuant to the proposed legislation will ensure late entrants will not be charged disproportionate premiums and specify the maximum loadings on an insurer's normal community rated premium which will be permitted. Based on actuarial <Col N="16" /> advice made available to me, such maximum loadings will range from 10% between the ages of 35 and 44 to 80% at age 65 and over. Those who hold cover at the time of enactment of the proposed amending legislation will not be liable to the extra age at entry premium loadings allowed.</P>
    <P>Though the proposed age loadings will not apply to persons who have private health insurance when the proposed legislation is enacted in respect of their existing level of cover, insurers will be permitted to apply a loading in respect of additional cover taken out where persons move to an insurance plan which offers higher benefits. Any loading in such circumstances is to be limited in its application to the difference between the levels of the plans involved and the maximum level of loading will be prescribed in legislation.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the revised arrangements for risk equalisation proposed in the Bill. I will now address the need for risk equalisation in a health insurance system such as that which operates here. Our private health insurance system operates under the widely accepted principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. With some exceptions, this means that insurers must accept all comers, irrespective of their age or health status and charge them a standard premium for a given level of cover. In other words, insurers cannot be selective about the risks they will cover or the price they will charge. This is fine so long as all insurers' risk profiles are broadly similar. There is a serious danger, however, that the market could be destabilised if significant variations in risk profiles emerge. For example, if some insurers, by accident or design, end up with a younger/healthier population, they will be able to charge a lower premium. The other side of the coin is that premiums will rise inevitably for those insurers left with a higher proportion of less healthy individuals.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that in this scenario the market risk equilibrium would be restored by people switching from the higher charging insurers to those with lower premium rates. This is fine in theory but in practice those who are most likely to switch in this way are those at the lower end of the risk spectrum. This would have the direct effect of pushing up rates even more for the less fortunate insurers, ending up in what could easily become a self-destructive rates spiral and the risk, in extreme cases, that one or more of the affected insurers would collapse. This would seriously undermine the public trust and confidence in the stability of the system which is vital in a voluntary community rated environment such as ours. Risk equalisation is the mechanism which will ensure this type of potential destabilisation does not occur. It simply aims to equalise differences in health insurers' costs which arise due to significant variations in their risk profiles.</P>
    <P>The need for risk equalisation in a private health insurance system such as ours is supported by a wide range of national and international <Col N="17" /> expert opinion and experience. In particular, it was supported by the independent advisory group on the risk equalisation scheme which reported to the former Minister for Health and Children in April 1998. The European Union's third non-life directive opens the possibility for member states to introduce specific legal provisions, including risk equalisation or loss compensation as it is referred to in the directive, in the regulation of health insurance business. The purpose of section 9 of the Bill is to enable implementation of significant changes in the arrangements for risk equalisation as originally envisaged under the 1994 Act with a view to addressing concerns about its commencement and impact.</P>
    <P>The Department is satisfied as to the necessity for risk equalisation to ensure the stability of our community rated system. Adequate risk equalisation is a necessary complement to community rating. Without adequate risk equalisation, community rating and open enrolment in a competitve market create large incentives for risk selection which would have the adverse effects described. This is not just theory; it occurred in Holland during the 1970s and 1980s when, due to the absence of risk equalisation, several insurers had to be saved from bankruptcy due to being caught in a deadly premium spiral of a worsening risk pool and increasing premiums. Risk equalisation offers the most effective method for reducing cream skimming because it reduces the incentives for risk selection.</P>
    <P>In preparing the relevant section of the Bill account was taken of the many views expressed. The Minister is satisfied that the proposed risk equalisation arrangements represent a prudent, fair and balanced approach to a contentious and complex matter. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>The Minister of State claims that the Bill proposes key amendments to the Health Act, 1994, but these do not meet the amendments that need to be made to the Act. A golden opportunity is being missed to deal with what is an unprecedented crisis in the health service. Ireland probably has the worst health service in Europe, not because we do not have the ingredients for a good service &ndash; we do; we have the necessary staff, including professionals, who are both willing and good, and the money &ndash; but because we do not have a strategy, vision or leadership. Nor do we have the courage or sense of justice needed to completely overhaul the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by an article on the front page of the <i>Irish Examiner </i>this morning in which reference is made to an eminent oncologist who has spoken out in public as he simply cannot tolerate a situation where patients of his who are dying of cancer cannot be admitted to hospital. The apartheid we have introduced to so-called health care is appalling and would not have been tolerated in South Africa at the height of the apartheid regime. If one has money, one does not suffer; <Col N="18" /> one can be admitted to hospital to die in peace, but if one does not have money, one is left at the mercy of the system.</P>
    <P>A lady who visits me at my advice clinic is on the urgent admissions list for treatment. Athough her knees and arms are turned in and she is stooped and in pain, she cannot be admitted. Each time she goes to the hospital the appointment is deferred. If she could afford to pay, she would be seen. At a time of unparalleled economic development, with record budget surpluses, those who cannot afford to pay are left crippled in pain while those who can write cheques go to the top of the list.</P>
    <P>The Government does not have a health strategy. It is focused on the latest operational trauma. Task forces, reports, committees, inquiries into various matters, all stand in place of a real strategy. We need a plan for health. We need to plan the work and work the plan.</P>
    <P>This major overhaul cannot come about without confronting vested interests, which contribute to the chaos, even though they are meant to be part of the solution. The Hippocratic oath states in part: &ldquo;The regimen I adopt shall be for the benefit of my patients according to my ability and judgment, and not for their hurt or any wrong.&rdquo;  It goes on to state: &ldquo;Whatever house I enter, there I will go for the benefit of the sick,..&rdquo;. Some medical doctors and certainly some medical administrators and politicians need to read that oath because we are failing those people. We are not providing a fair and equitable health care system, even though we have unprecedented resources to do it.</P>
    <P>We especially need to bring the content of the Hippocratic oath to the attention of some hospital consultants. Most hospital consultants are very hard working and sometimes do more than is expected of them, delivering a service in very difficult circumstances. However, others do not meet their commitments to public care and to the remuneration they receive for it. The problem is we have no way of measuring who are the good and the bad consultants because in most cases they refuse any kind of supervision. That is not right or proper.</P>
    <P>Efforts have been made in the past to bring about greater equity in the treatment of public and private patients, but widespread concern continues that doctors favour those who increase their incomes. That has been said in an official Government report. If I recall correctly, five consultants sat on the committee that wrote the report. Some might say that is fair enough, but is it? Hospital consultants receive a fixed salary for their treatment of public patients, but they also receive an individual fee for each private patient. In a recent series on the health services in<i> The Irish Times</i> one health administrator said that if one was paid per customer in the bar but by per pint in the lounge, all the business would be done in the lounge.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on private health insurance concluded that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> Rational economic behaviour would suggest that a stronger incentive exists for those consultants who are significantly involved in private practice to concentrate a disproportionate amount of time on these private patients. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the private hospitals employ relatively few consultants or other medical staff of their own, relying to a great degree on the availability of doctors who hold public contracts.</P>
    <P>If anybody wishes to take me to task on what I have said I would have to respond by asking why they did not take to task the White Paper? Why is the Government that produced the White Paper not doing something about it?</P>
    <P>More than 80% of consultants are engaged in private and public practice. The cost of consultants to the Exchequer this year will be approximately £200 million, plus approximately £110 million from the VHI and somewhere between £69,000 and £86,000 per consultant paid directly from the Exchequer. They are contracted to work 33 hours per week with public patients. Most do that, some do more. Some go out of their way to meet people in their private consultancy room to help public patients. We must acknowledge and be grateful for that.</P>
    <P>However, the 33 hours per week consultants are contracted to work with public patients is unsupervised. While I have no doubt most consultants meet their obligation, some do not. I also have no doubt that most work very hard. I have no difficulty with them being well remunerated. They should be well remunerated for their skills and the efforts they have made to qualify as consultants. If we want to give people an incentive to enter the profession, which is very demanding, we must remunerate them. I have no difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>Even the good consultants, those who are more than pulling their weight, must know that there has to be a reform of work practices. A Government review group comprising 12 members, five of whom were consultants, which reported on waiting lists stated: &ldquo;Some hospitals or consultants may find it attractive to maintain a public waiting list because a proportion of those waiting may opt to be treated privately.&rdquo;  That is an extraordinary indictment of the medical system. Could anybody in this House make a statement to indicate more acutely the need for a total overhaul of the health system and for a completely new strategy?</P>
    <P>No strategy applies. We have a piecemeal approach to health, one that has destroyed what was an excellent health system. It has made a horse's collar of the system for those who cannot afford to write a cheque. According to the Minister's statistics, which are usually understated, 31,000 are on hospital waiting lists, many of them in great pain. Is there any greater indictment of this apartheid ridden system and of those who practice within it than the statement I have just quoted?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> Consultants are allowed use of public hospitals for their private patients. We have given an incentive for this medical apartheid. Some doctors continue to conspire to ensure that the system prevails. All the time the Government prevaricates and poorer patients suffer. In the<i> Irish Examiner</i> this morning an oncologist had the courage to state:</P>
    <P>This practice is being funded by public money. More than 90% of the money spent on health care comes directly from the Exchequer. Only about 9% comes from private insurance.</P>
    <P>I propose that the Committee of Public Accounts be given similar powers to those it has been granted to conduct the DIRT inquiry to praise those consultants who work hard and to identify those referred to in the Government report. I also propose that the committee call politicians, civil servants, health board and hospital administrators, medics and others to account under oath so that the committee can make recommendations for the ending of this incentive against the poor.</P>
    <P>Not all the reasons for the waiting lists can be blamed on the work practices of consultants. If it were not for the work rate of some of them the entire system would collapse. However, any inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts should examine the use of resources within the health system. I have been told by a leading firm of specialists that up to 20% of expenditure on health &ndash; which in total amounts to a little more than £4 billion per year &ndash; may be wasted. Do we have energy controls? Are materials properly used? Are X-ray and laboratory departments so disorganised that patients are unnecessarily kept in hospitals awaiting test results?</P>
    <P>If we identified only 5% of waste within that total expenditure of more than £4 billion, we should consider the amount of money that could be realised for expenditure elsewhere within the health system. We should not say it cannot be done. It can be done if we have the vision, commitment and courage to do it. However, we have a &lsquo;smart Alec' mentality which says that if a person is from Cork, he or she can be appointed to the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. They are not there to serve the Minister but to serve the people. It is the Minister's job to ensure the resources are used to serve the people and that is not happening.</P>
    <P>Consultants could head off imposed solutions to the hospital crises by entering into partnership with the Government to make the system work. If partnership does not evolve, will the Government have the bottle to take on vested interests? When will we have real reform of the health service?</P>
    <P>The Minister half heartedly takes on only soft targets, such as his recent tilts at the tobacco industry. It seems extraordinary that he can get away with his publicity stunt in relation to the tobacco industry at the same time as the Government is extending drinking hours. This was not asked for by public representatives in Dublin or <Col N="21" /> anywhere else and parents do not want it. The Government has allowed alcohol to be glamorised to the extent that the national hurling game is now sponsored to the strength of Guinness. It is trying to fool the people that it is concerned about their health by using gimmicks about tobacco. I am concerned about tobacco but I will take the Minister's concerns more seriously when he is prepared to look at what we are doing in the area of alcohol.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute disgrace that Guinness Ireland is allowed to use a series of advertisements which suggest that alcohol is good for everything from boosting a person's confidence, to a hangover the next day or to improving the hair of the dog. It has now attached this to the national game of hurling. The GAA, Guinness Ireland and the Government think it is a great idea, while the Minister, Henry Winterman himself, wants to take on the soft target of the tobacco industry. When will we take on difficult targets? When will we take on the people who are inducing people to take alcohol at an increasingly young age? The Eastern Regional Health Authority has carried out research in this area. Approximately 50% of children from 14 years of age upwards admit they have indulged in alcohol. I will produce statistics if the Minister thinks that is an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>Why are we unique in Europe for the unprecedented numbers on waiting lists for hospital treatment? Why do people in Ireland die younger than those in other developed countries? A comparative population of 3.7 million in France would live 13 million years longer. Why, according to the ESRI research carried out by Professor Brian Nolan, do higher professional men aged between 55 and 64 have a death rate of only 13 per 1,000 compared to 22 per 1,000 for semi-skilled workers and 32 per 1,000 for unskilled manual groups? Is it too dramatic to suggest we have a form of social apartheid and that the health system, among other services, contributes to that? When will the Government act to bring an end to an unacceptable system? </P>
    <P>I understand the VHI and BUPA have made formal submissions to the Department of Health and Children on this legislation. The VHI suggests that a reduction in the length of the opt-out period from 36 months to 18 months for new entrants to the market in respect of participants in risk equalisation should be considered. The Minister of State made a case for the alternative to that. Why was a period of 36 months chosen? I understand the original documentation published by the Government suggested 18 months.</P>
    <P>The VHI also suggested the inclusion of a new provision in the Bill to expand the powers of the VHI as set out in the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, 1957 to 1998. I am informed that the VHI is extremely concerned about the proposal in the legislation that new entrants to the insurance market would be entitled to opt out of any risk equalisation scheme for a period of 36 months following entry to it. Perhaps the Minister of State could tell the House if any potential entrant <Col N="22" /> asked for this 36 month period or if it was decided by someone in the Department. Does the VHI have a reasonable case in suggesting that 18 months is a sufficient lead-in period?</P>
    <P>The 1999 White Paper on private health insurance set out the reasons risk equalisation is required in a community rated private health insurance market. The Government's view, which is supported by a wide range of independent experts and interests as set out in the White Paper, is that risk equalisation is essential to underpin and protect the stability of community rating. That is fair enough but the White Paper indicated that to further encourage competition, it was proposed that an insurer entering the health insurance market would be given the choice of availing of a temporary exemption from participation in the proposed risk equalisation scheme for a maximum period of 18 months from the commencement of trading.</P>
    <P>Out of the blue, the White Paper is now being ignored and the Government is proposing 36 months. Why? Who has asked for the 36 month period and why has there been a change in policy? The stated reason for the exemption was the recognition of the value in terms of the enhanced competition new entrants would bring. I accept that is a reasonable point. However, what has happened between the publication of the White Paper and the publication of the legislation to increase it from 18 months to 36 months? I understand the VHI disputes the need for an 18 month lead-in period, but it accepts it is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department is striving to achieve a balance between underpinning community rating and encouraging new entrants to the market. However, I do not understand why we need to have a three year lead-in period. Is it possible, given that three years is a long time, that a company could come into the market, make a killing for three years and then leave once the three year period is over and it must play on a level playing field? Meanwhile, it has weakened existing players, such as BUPA and the VHI. I would like to know the reasoning behind this proposal and who has asked for it?</P>
    <P>The VHI's powers are currently limited to the provision of health and health related insurance schemes. The 1999 White Paper on private health insurance indicated the Government's intention to implement legislation to give greater commercial freedom to the VHI to enable it to meet the challenges of the competitive environment in which it operates. The VHI states that it has developed a comprehensive corporate strategy in the past year and a half which focuses on broadening the organisation's product and services range in health care and other related sectors. It states that the aim of this strategy is to develop and transform the VHI into an integrated health care service provider.</P>
    <P>Until now the VHI has operated on the basis of the provision of a single core product. A number of new products, services and business areas <Col N="23" /> have been identified by the VHI in respect of which the organisation's experience to date in the health care business would make it an ideal provider. It also claims there are compelling reasons it should be given powers to enable it to exploit new business opportunities while continuing to provide community rated indemnity insurance for private health care.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's view on the VHI's proposals on the provision of child care services and the development of e-commerce initiatives in Europe in the health care area? Is he prepared to consider extending the powers of the VHI and, if so, why has provision not been made in the Bill?</P>
    <P>It will be a long time before we have legislation dealing with medical insurance providers before this House again so we should take an opportunity on this occasion to determine what is actually needed in the market and the reason the Minister has not acceded to what appears to be a reasonable suggestion from the VHI. I want to share my time with Deputy Deenihan, with the agreement of the House.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accept a piecemeal approach to health policy. I am not prepared to accept a health system that does not have a strategy. I do not see any strategy. All I see are sticking plaster policies and public relations gimmicks every day of the week. Whenever a judge states in court that he will not tolerate the way children are being treated, or something in relation to autism, a task force is immediately set up. When are we going to stop this operational approach to dealing with the latest crisis? When will we have a strategy? When will the 31,000 people on the list, many of whom are in pain, be seen? When will my constituent who comes to see me on Monday evening, bent and in agony, get her appointment?</P>
      <P>We have to get it through to this Minister in particular that the health service is not in place to buttress him and ensure his return to a seat in this House. The most disgraceful abuse of power ever exercised by a Minister for Health was that exercised by Minister Martin in appointing ten of the 12 Irish Blood Transfusion Service board members from his own bailiwick and sphere. To do this to a service as vulnerable and as sensitive as the IBTS shows a total lack of judgment on the Minister's part. How will the five member health insurance authority be appointed under this legislation? How many of them have to be pals of the Minister?</P>

      <P>This Bill is about introducing competition to the private health insurance area. I have examined two surveys carried out over the past two years which show that Ireland is the least competitive country in Europe as regards private health provision. On a scale of one to ten, the Indecon international economic survey of European and US insurance companies show Ireland at 9.5, where one is extremely competitive and ten is least competitive. The private health insurance market in Ireland is now the least competitive in Europe. The most competitive is the UK which came out at two on the scale of one to ten. The survey showed comprehensively that the potential benefits of competition reduces costs to the consumer, results in product innovations, provides incentive for new delivery mechanisms and incentivises preventive initiatives. It also indicated that people rated the element of competition as being very important and considered that it reduced costs to the consumer.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out in Ireland by BUPA Ireland showed that Irish people placed a substantially higher rating on quality rather than price when considering products or services. In fact, nine out of ten rate high quality as important while the equivalent for low prices is six in ten. That survey, carried out by Lansdowne Market Research, showed clearly that increased competition in the health insurance market is considered important by two out of every three adults. That is higher than even the telephone or banking services and is well ahead of markets such as mobile phones or postal services. It showed that people want more competition in the health insurance market despite awareness that some competition already exists. More than six in ten people are aware that there is some competition in the health insurance market, although it is generally felt that there is a little rather than a lot. The survey also showed clearly that it is widely acknowledged that there is not enough choice in the health insurance market both in terms of companies and products.</P>
      <P>I am a long-term member of the VHI. I am very loyal to the company and would find it difficult to move but as a rural TD I have great respect for BUPA Ireland, which set up in Fermoy and which has been a wonderful addition to corporate Ireland. It gives a quality service, provides good quality employment and supports the community in terms of healthy pursuits. For example, BUPA has sponsored Sonia O'Sullivan through lean and good times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking at the Irish market in private health insurance there is only one competitor, namely, <Col N="25" /> the VHI. That makes our market the least competitive in the European Union and that cannot be good for consumers. Many commentators have said that the White Paper, and indeed this Bill, give VHI everything it wanted. That must be of concern given that the VHI reports directly to the authors of the White Paper. On my reading the Bill appears very restrictive and much like the 1994 Act which failed to allow any significant competition to develop. Competition has been good for everyone here along with the option of different products and lower prices, something which should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister willing to consider amending the Bill to ensure that the market is more competitive? In particular, I ask him to answer the following questions. In order to protect and enhance competition in the market, will the Minister make it more transparent so that there is no hidden and unfair cross-subsidy of products? Will he amend the Bill to ensure that the Health Insurance Authority acts in a manner which conforms to Community law, generally advances the consumers' interests and does not stifle competition? Will he limit Government intervention in the market to the minimum necessary, in particular recognising that risk equalisation should be a genuine reserve power? Will he take account of the fact that risk equalisation is not a panacea and that it will discourage entry to the market, reduce consumers' choice, increase their costs and in the long-term may harm the principle of community rating? I ask the officials to ask the Minister to address the matters I have raised. I can pass on my notes if they are needed.</P>

      <P>This Bill is being debated against the background of a health service in crisis. It deals with the regulation of private health insurance but does not deal with the gross deficiencies that are increasingly evident to the public who receive health care and to the professionals who deliver that care.</P>
      <P>A Bill to amend the Health Insurance Act could have been a major step forward for the health service. It could have been the outcome of a policy for change based on the principles of access and excellence. Instead, it is bolstering the dysfunctional aspects of our health insurance system. It will further separate primary care from hospital care by removing cover for general practice from community rating. This is a retrogressive move. Community rating is a safeguard against cherry-picking which is as much a factor at primary care level, or will become so, as it is at secondary level. In some respects the Bill is likely to deepen the inequality that is already pervasive in our system of health care. Therefore the Labour Party cannot support this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our health service could be the finest in the world. We have the highest professional standards in medical and support care staff but it is a service in serious difficulty, characterised by waiting lists, staff shortages, under-funding, low morale in our hospitals and services being stretched <Col N="26" /> to breaking point. In many ways, matters are worse now than they were in the early 1980s.</P>
    <P>Today I received a letter from a neurosurgeon in Beaumont Hospital, following a letter I wrote to him about a young man who is living in constant agony and pain. He pointed out that since 1998 there has been a 25% cutback in theatre time and that almost three-quarters of admissions in 1997 were emergencies which left no spare capacity for elective surgery. In his words, &ldquo;It is simply a fact that the amount of operating time per week in your surgery is less than that available in the early 1980s&rdquo;. This has been confirmed in the annual report by the Mater Hospital, where cutbacks are affecting procedures and ensuring that waiting lists are being lengthened rather than shortened.</P>
    <P>Last week the Exchequer returns showed a surplus of almost £200 million over and above estimates for the year. We are awash with money, yet our hospital theatres are being closed and beds are being kept vacant or inappropriately occupied while patients suffer and wait for treatment. Nursing posts cannot be filled and vacancies are occurring in junior hospital doctor posts. The Government's response to these shortages is to go abroad for recruitment purposes. It is a short-term and morally suspect response. Plundering the developing world for skilled medical staff is hardly a solution of which we should be proud. It is hardly the way to deal with structural problems that so deeply affect patient care.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech dwelt on the increased spending in health care in recent years. When the coffers are choked with money, increased spending on health from a notorious low level that pertained in the 1980s is hardly news. This is not the first Government to significantly increase spending on health. How that spending is allocated is the issue &ndash; how to spread the benefits to those who need them most, regardless of geographic location and of their ability to pay. That is the challenge this Bill could have begun to address, but instead it is driving health care further into a straitjacket of a two tier system that is unfair and inefficient.</P>
    <P>Inequality is at the heart of our system. Despite the best efforts of health professionals to ameliorate the two tier nature of health care, inequality not only persists but is getting worse. We all know that everyone has a statutory entitlement to public hospital care, but this entitlement cannot be met under the current regime, the existence of long hospital waiting lists is testimony to that. There is a gap between entitlements to elective procedures and performance and only those who can afford to pay are able to bridge that gap, and they are doing so in ever-increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>In 1979, 21.8% of the population had private health insurance, today 45% of the population have it. According to the ESRI, the main reason for this is to get quick access to hospital, in effect, to jump the queue. In the meantime people on low incomes, who often live in poverty, die at a younger age and suffer more illness than those <Col N="27" /> on higher incomes. That is an outcome of socio-economic conditions. In Ireland, uniquely in the European Union, those on low incomes who live in poverty suffer further scandalous disadvantage. The nation's health service is heavily weighed against them. At general practitioner level, only the poor can get free care under the GMS. Those on low or modest income pay as much as those on high incomes. For many this presents desperate choices when a family member is sick. Even children are denied the security of medical care on a guaranteed basis free at the point of delivery. Withdrawing community rating and ancillary services, as the Bill proposes, will create, in effect, a three tier system at primary care level, those on GMS, those who will have private health insurance and those who will fall between both categories.</P>
    <P>Currently at hospital level the service is grounded firmly in the iron rule of ability to pay. While emergencies are dealt with on an equal basis, speedy access to other acute hospital services is provided for those with the money to pay for private care. Those who cannot afford private health insurance are often forced to wait on long waiting lists. Some of them die before they get the care they need.</P>
    <P>Our health service is built on apartheid, pure and simple. It is as unfair and immoral as any system of racial apartheid. I am pleased this description, originally coined by the Labour Party, has gained common currency. Unfortunately, it is a fair description of how our health system works.</P>
    <P>The Government, with overflowing coffers at its disposal, has thrown vast amounts of money at the problem often to little or no avail. Approximately £35 million was spent in a year on the waiting list initiative and what have we seen as a result? The waiting lists are practically at the same level as they were when the Government took office three years ago. They increased and while they have decreased somewhat there is not a marked difference. If waiting lists were reduced it had as much to do with the fact that people got tired waiting and went privately, moved away or died rather than by any initiative taken by the Government. Even the number of in-patient hospital procedures has not increased significantly. This is the record of a Government that pledged, on taking office, it would tackle the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>We have the worst premature death rate from heart disease in the EU, almost twice the European average. We have one of the highest cancer rates. Our life expectancy, in many cases, is lower. Irish women, on average, have seven fewer years of life than French women. In part at least the inequality inherent in our health service is a key factor in our poor health status.</P>
    <P>We cannot be proud of our health system, as it is currently constructed, but we can change it. Yet the Government is unwilling or unable to meet the challenge. Instead there is a determination to <Col N="28" /> defend the indefensible, to shore up the iniquitous system of public-private mix rather than reform it fundamentally.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of that thinking. The same applies to the White Paper, which avoided tackling the issue of inequality. It states, &ldquo;The Government therefore consider that a fundamental departure from the existing system of voluntary private health insurance is not warranted in view of reforms envisaged to improve resilience and operation of system.&rdquo;  In other words, we will perpetuate the current two tier system and attempt to ameliorate its worst effects by throwing money at it.</P>
    <P>In October 1999, the health economist, Joe Durcan, of University College Dublin, outlined the reality of health care in Ireland. He said:</P>
    <P>The public/private mix in the Irish healthcare system is often seen as not only unique in terms of scale but also a major advantage. The particular advantage claimed is that it allows the best physicians to function in both areas of the market so that the public system is not adversely affected by the loss of the best to the private system. [That is a fair comment.] Their public hours of work are governed by contract. Once the contractual obligation is met, they can function as private agents. [That is the important point]. There is thus an incentive for consultants to create waiting lists for treatment, in the expectation that since a significant proportion of the population have health insurance people with a public entitlement to care will use their health insurance to pay for treatment. Such queue-jumping is now an integral part of the Irish healthcare system.</P>
    <P>This public/private mix also affects public hospitals. They are allowed to take private patients up to certain limits. (These limits are unaffected by the closure of public wards.) Private patients enhance hospital earnings, given their budgets from the State. This is thus an incentive for hospitals to increase the number of private beds, even though there is a public waiting list.</P>
    <P>His judgment is vindicated by the figures. The inverse incentive for consultants and hospitals that he described has created a giant growth in private health insurance. A total of 45% of people are now privately insured. The private work of consultants in hospitals has grown proportionately to meet the demand for private care. One argument put forward in support of the present system is that private health insurance provides an important source of income, but it actually contributes a significant proportion of overall health spending that is not that large. If one goes back to 1998 the Government estimated an overall spend of approximately £2.7 billion, while the total VHI claim was approximately £304 million. Furthermore, this latter figure must be netted down to reflect tax relief on private health insurance premia and the indirect subsidy of private health insurance through pricing <Col N="29" /> private beds in public hospitals as less than the full economic cost. It is a significant figure, but it hardly justifies the gross inequity that it entails. Moreover, reform of the system can take place in a way whereby these contributions are not lost to the system.</P>
    <P>In the meanwhile, we should remember that the public system continues to fail to deliver. As they wait, public patients are forced to endure illness, disability, incapacitation and danger to life. Those people are our least well off: the elderly, the powerless and the most vulnerable. The current system depends on these waiting lists and feeds off them. If there were a serious effort made to tackle waiting lists and if it were done without the necessary structural reform, it would create new problems without solving old ones. Injecting massive resources needed to counteract the fundamental inequities of the current system on its own without the necessary reform would destabilise the current market. People would withdraw from private care back into the public system and there would, as a consequence, be further additional costs accruing to the State. This is the logical outcome of the policy the State is putting forward.</P>
    <P>We need to remind ourselves that this system we have inherited was not designed to take the form it has taken. Things are worse in the health care area in many ways than they were 20 years ago and we need to remember that. Honest efforts have been made to ameliorate the hardship being caused. Nobody designed the health care system to be deliberately run on apartheid lines; theoretically it is based on a universal entitlement to hospital care. However, we are all acutely aware that this is an entitlement we cannot rely upon. Almost half of the population are in the fortunate position of being able to choose private health insurance and have chosen that; at a guess, I imagine the vast majority if not all Members are private health insurance subscribers.</P>
    <P>This is the system we have, but it has developed for historical and political reasons and is now in crisis and is crying out for reform. Until there is a framework and a new dispensation whereby the patient, regardless of income, is central to the system, we will continue to muddle along while too many lives are blasted and lost unnecessarily and thoughtlessly. The ways and means of creating such a new dispensation is what we should debate today. We should discuss the means whereby everybody will have equal access to necessary health care and moreover, the means whereby everyone will have access to integrated health care, which incorporates both primary and secondary care, in order to maximise the quality and efficiency of the service.</P>
    <P>We should consider the possible development of a universal compulsory insurance scheme providing choice of insurers for all. It is interesting that there is a growing consciousness and debate outside the House about such an option. If we created this kind of universal insurance scheme, I <Col N="30" /> do not doubt that it would create a modern and just health service to meet the needs of the 21st century, but this debate is not occurring within the Government. Despite all its resources, the Department and the Minister have skirted the challenge. The White Paper, as Mr. Joe Durcan pointed out, simply did not reach the mark. He said:</P>
    <P>The White Paper does not fully appreciate that a compulsory health insurance scheme would be essentially a private scheme. The reasons for the rejection make it clear that the point has been missed.</P>
    <P>He was commenting on the fact that the White Paper simply rejected the idea of a universal scheme on the basis that it would be a social insurance scheme. Disgracefully, the White Paper on private health insurance failed to explore the possibilities of change and ducked the question implicit in its criticism of the current arrangements when it stated:</P>
    <P>Rational economic behaviour would suggest that a stronger incentive exists for those consultants who are significantly involved in private practice to concentrate a disproportionate amount of personal time on these private patients. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the private hospitals employ relatively few consultant or other medical staff of their own, relying to a great degree on the availability of doctors who also hold public contracts.</P>
    <P>Even the Government's review group set up to examine the waiting lists made the same point: that there is an inbuilt incentive for hospitals and doctors to maintain public waiting lists. The economic relationship between the consultant and the private patient is very different from that between the consultant and the public patient and this fact determines the distortions in the system. However, unlike Deputy Mitchell, I do not see this as a question of bashing the consultants. It is to a large extent to their credit and to the credit of the professionalism of individual doctors that it has not led to even greater inequality. This different relationship between two classes of patient is the point where change must occur and the question that the White Paper should have posed &ndash; given its work &ndash; is how we tackle that difference in a way that delivers quality care for all. The White Paper failed to do so and dismissed in very few words the possibility of a universal social insurance based system. It is silent on the possibility of any other universal system based on private insurance. There may be other ways to resolve the issue of equal access to quality care, although we in the Labour Party have spent a great deal of time in consultation and debate with interested parties in order to find alternatives to the one we propose. So far it appears that our proposition is sound. However, it is disappointing that the Government is dismissive without engaging with the issues raised by our proposals. Why? <Col N="31" /> Why is this Government incapable of exploring the possibilities for reform that are open to us as a society? Instead we are presented with this Bill which will not make things better and may well make things worse. The Minister said this Bill will provide a framework to support the development of a vigorous and competitive private health insurance market, but even by this criterion the Bill is open to criticism. Dr. Michael Moore, in his critique published in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> is scathing, stating:</P>
    <P>It is unclear why the Government has come forward with a strategy that, if it promotes competition at all, will promote competition which destabilises the market and undermines the insurance market, healthcare delivery system development and consumer welfare.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>Freedom to price and offer ancillary service products in any way they see fit presents health insurers with tremendous opportunities to use discriminatory pricing and product development techniques to cherry-pick the main health insurance market. Given the very uneven distribution of illness and healthcare costs, the incentives to cherry-pick are great.</P>
    <P>He also stated that the inevitable outcome of this deregulation is that the market will become unstable and consumers classified as high risk, such as the chronically ill and the aged will find difficulty in gaining access to good and affordable coverage. Dr. Moore concluded that:</P>
    <P>Government policy lacks coherence. On the one hand it is giving insurers the opportunities and incentives to attract best risks and undermine community rating, curtailing access for vulnerable groups. On the other hand it is seeking to bolster community rating through the introduction of risk equalization and late-entry premium loading and improve access by expanding the open enrolment provisions to cover the over 65s. Furthermore, if two separate systems of community-rated hospital services and deregulated ancillary services are sanctioned it will be almost impossible to plan overall health services in an appropriate manner, which includes effective prevention and disease management strategies. This will have major implications for the long-term development of general practice and is at odds with the Minister's well publicised preventative health strategy.</P>
    <P>These are very important points and they must be answered. The argument for the integration of primary care and secondary care is paramount if we are to ensure both quality and efficiency in our services. What this expert says, and we must pay attention to it, is that the future possibilities of that integration are seriously damaged if we proceed down this route. According to the same <Col N="32" /> expert, even in its short-term goals the Bill has deficiencies. He says: &ldquo;Apart from enticing cherry-picking health insurers to the market through the deregulation of ancillary services, the Government policies will do little to promote competition&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He is also critical of the risk equalisation measures. The point about the 18 months and the 36 months was made by Deputy Mitchell and it requires an answer since it appears to conflict with the White Paper. The point Dr. Moore makes, which again needs to be answered, is that, while he has nothing against risk equalisation and it is a very important measure which must exist in any legal framework, it can serve to subsidise inefficiency. He says:</P>
    <P>Under the proposed scheme, health insurers that are effective in keeping hospitalisation costs down through prevention and disease management programmes and coverage of services in non-hospital settings would have to transfer at least 40% of any claims cost savings that they generate. The Minister promotes prevention and disease management strategies yet subverts health insurers intent on pursuing such approaches through this deregulation of ancillary services and the proposed risk equalisation scheme.</P>
    <P>It is very important that, when the Minister returns to the House, he answers the points made by Dr. Moore to the satisfaction of the House. There is a great deal of fuzziness in the Bill and he needs to be clear as to the outcomes of the changes he proposes, especially regarding the changes in general practice and the further relationship between it and secondary care.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has put forward its own proposals for reform based on a universal health insurance scheme designed to bring the benefits of competition not just to some citizens but to all. We propose that, as a society, we need to progress beyond the current system not by eliminating the advantages given by health insurance but by ensuring that those advantages are extended to everyone. We propose the establishment of a national forum on health to engage all those involved in health care, including patients, in debate and policy making for the future.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, the Government is silent on our proposal but, in its White Paper, undertakes to promote and facilitate not a national health forum for all but a private health care forum which will exclusively bring together interests delivering private health care for some. How the great traditions of Fianna Fáil that produced progress like the GMS scheme and universal secondary education for every child in the State have shrivelled and died. We are seeing policy being produced by political pygmies in a party that once produced political giants.</P>
    <P>What we see is a tinkering with the <i>status quo</i>. It is a watering down of the safeguards established by a previous Government. It is based on free market principles, to an extent, yet it denies <Col N="33" /> many free access to that market. This Bill is not about the future &ndash; not even a small part of it. It does not reflect any policy development of any significance. Measured by its own lights, it reflects confusion in the Government's approach. What is so dispiriting is that it is being introduced by a Government that has possibilities and resources undreamt of by any previous incumbents. We should remember that the times are propitious for great change for good.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children is clearly not a reformer. He is keen on initiatives for individual aspects of health, such as smoking, for example. We in the Labour Party have no problem in supporting him fully in those initiatives. However, there is a deep conservatism at the heart of the Government that resists reform. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, rewards the rich while inflation wipes out any social welfare increases granted in the previous budget. The Minister, Deputy Martin, tinkers with initiatives while the big picture passes him by. This Bill is about tinkering. It is not about change or reform. It is vague and, where it is not vague, it is retrogressive. In terms of the fundamentals, the Minister spoke recently on radio about the way he saw health care from a fundamental perspective. There is no evidence from this Bill that he is thinking in this way. Sadly, the converse may be true.</P>
    <P>This Bill will remove the provision of so-called ancillary services, including general practice, from the safeguards of the Health Insurance Act. Unless the Minister can prove me wrong, it seems to me that cherry-picking will result. Inevitably, the disconnection which characterises the relationship between primary and secondary care which we all recognise is not to the advantage of the patient will be exacerbated rather than being brought closer together.</P>
    <P>The development of the private health insurance market in Ireland will be in the public interest. I want to see insurers providing the type of competition and efficiencies they can. I recognise they have a role to play and that they can take different forms, such as not-for-profit or privately owned. However, they will only provide that kind of good in terms of the public interest if the legal and regulatory framework is right from the outset. Regrettably, the Government has not provided that framework in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill which is yet another positive step being taken by the Government in the health area. More money has been spent in the area in the past three years by this Government than by anyone before and a serious attempt is being <Col N="34" /> made to address the grave problem of waiting lists throughout the country. I am well aware of the position as a former chairperson of the Western Health Board. However, I now see, by virtue of the dialogue which has taken place between the board and the Department of Health and Children, a Government which has decided for the first time ever to seriously address the waiting lists problem.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill because private health insurance is a fundamental element of the health system we operate and that is evident by the fact that 44% of people avail of private health insurance. Deputy McManus said private health insurers have a role to play and that is certainly the case. It is in everyone's interests that as much competition is brought into this market as possible to ensure we receive the best possible service in this area. I welcome the Bill because it goes a long way towards encouraging competition in the private health market. It also brings in a significant amount of health insurance premiums of the order of £450 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The system works so well probably because of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which incorporates a number of core fundamental principles which are very important. First is the community rating principle which requires that the same premium be charged for a specified level of cover regardless of the age, gender or sexual orientation of the individual. It has always been the position that the premiums of young people have gone towards providing services for the old. Many subscribers to the health insurance system fully understand that they are paying a premium now which will remain at the same level in the future, provided they continue to retain the same level of cover. We are prepared to pay such premiums to benefit in our old age. That is a core principle which must be retained.</P>
      <P>I value the open enrolment principle in the Bill under which health insurers are required to accept all individuals aged under 65 who wish to enrol in any health insurance scheme. It is vital that the system should be open to allow any individual who wants to benefit from private health insurance to do so. I also value the core principle of lifetime cover where an insurer cannot refuse to renew a contract of any member. It is a fact of life that many of us may contract a serious illness at some stage. In that context, it would be a backward step to allow insurers to refuse to renew people's contracts. These are the type of core principles that have been in existence since the implementation of the Health Insurance Act, 1994. We want to retain, improve and strengthen those principles by passing the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is critical that insurers should provide minimum benefits and participate in risk equalisation. I listened with interest to Deputy McManus who stated that many private insurers might try to engage in cherry picking. I have no doubt that, without the correct regulations being in place, this <Col N="35" /> will be the case. However, if anything, the amendments in the Bill are designed to avoid that.</P>
    <P>It is amazing to hear the Deputy refer to the health policy document which was launched a number of months ago by the Labour Party. I recall Deputy Howlin, during the week it was introduced, stating on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that it was the most well researched document he had ever seen come before the Labour Party. I do not believe the document saw out the end of that week as far as discussion in the media was concerned because it was attacked by literally everyone involved in the health services and the media. It has been confined to the filing cabinet and has only been resurrected today during Deputy McManus's contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred to fairness and equity in the system. However, the policy her party wanted to see introduced would have meant the closure of many district hospitals throughout Ireland. As a person who lives in a rural constituency, I could not support a policy of that type. However, such a policy is only what I expected because the Labour Party has been opposed to regionalisation, Objective One status and other initiatives that would benefit rural counties such as Mayo. I was delighted to see the document in question being confined to the graveyard of other discarded Labour documents. However, it has re-emerged today during Deputy McManus's contribution.</P>
    <P>The aim of the 1994 Act was to safeguard the core principles of our health insurance system while encouraging competition in the market. The VHI held a monopoly until a few years ago and only one other major insurer, BUPA Ireland, has entered the market. While this company provides cover for 160,000 people, it is important to promote and encourage other competitors to enter the market. In that context, it is the reason we are debating this legislation today as a result of the European Union's third non-life insurance directive which necessitates the further opening of the market.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has taken on board the challenge of encouraging greater competition. We want to see the common good being catered for, but we also want to see a competitive market develop. Striking a successful balance between the two and providing consumers with fair choice at a competitive price are our main aims. The Bill goes a long way towards achieving those aims.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the core principles in the 1994 Act to which I already referred. The first thing we must do is consider the definition of a health insurance contract. Traditionally, the reason people take out private health insurance is that we are all terrified of the grave illnesses which might befall us during our lifetimes and the huge expenses we might incur as a result. People pay their insurance premiums in order that they will be covered for that eventuality. Most people who take out private health insurance do so for that reason. As a result, the <Col N="36" /> types of facilities that are available in acute hospitals, in-patient services and the ancillary services have not been considered in the same way by people who take out private health insurance. I refer here to out-patient services, GP services, dental and optical services. We are faced with a situation where people are covering themselves in respect of catastrophic illnesses but the market relating to ancillary services has not developed.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for ancillary health services to be removed from the ambit of the health insurance legislation with a view to encouraging greater activity and growth in that area. That is a positive step. The Bill also makes clear the distinction between health insurance and long-term care insurance, a different product which requires different financing and benefit structures. It is important that the two should not be confused.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends the provision of the regulatory system to any self-insurance arrangement that may be developed. Large employers have traditionally carried the risk for the health care of their employees, people such as prison officers, gardaí and the staff of the ESB. This can have serious consequences because many young people are employed by the companies to which I refer. If we are to introduce a system of equalisation, it is important to realise that many young people are involved in schemes of this sort and we could find ourselves in a situation where many elderly and sick people are left in the risk pool catered for by private health insurers. It is vital to balance the system between insurers in a fair and equitable way and the Bill makes provision in that regard.</P>
    <P>I will now look in detail at some of the core principles to which I referred earlier. I will first deal with community rating which involves paying an even premium throughout one's life for health insurance. The reality is that everyone does not enter into a private health insurance contract in their twenties. In an ideal world, that is what would happen. There has been considerable debate about this issue in the media this week. If one begins paying a premium in one's twenties, it is fair and equitable throughout one's life.</P>
    <P>It is important that if a person does not commence paying insurance at an early age and decides to enter the system later, he should be allowed to do so. However, to be fair to those who have paid premiums throughout their lives, it is only right that some sort of loading would be put in place to ensure equity in the system. While provisions in respect of late entry are not set out in the Bill, the White Paper outlines the loading which should apply to people who are over 35 or over 65. We should encourage the introduction of such loading mechanisms. In addition, it is important that insurers should have the discretion to provide a reduced premium for subscribers under the age of 23.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which are designed to encourage open enrolment and even to extend the offer of cover to people over 65 <Col N="37" /> years of age, bearing in mind that to enter the system at that stage they will be obliged to pay a loaded premium. However, it is important that these people should be eligible to avail of private insurance should they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the key and most controversial aspects of private health insurance is the area of risk equalisation. We must avoid cherry picking, we must bring stability to the system and we must encourage as much open market competition in this area as possible. The Bill attempts to address that matter by putting in place a fair system which will benefit everyone. Sadly, as stated earlier, our Labour colleagues seem to believe the provision of a fair and excellent service does not always extend to people living in the regions. That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Government has placed more capital grants and revenue at the disposal of the health boards to allow them to deal with the waiting lists and improve and enhance services, than has any other Administration since the foundation of the State. It is to be commended for doing so. We are moving in the right direction with the introduction of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When we speak of a private health insurance Bill we must also consider what the Government is doing for the public health sector. It is commendable that the Government has put £1,500 million in extra resources into the health service. This investment was badly needed because the health service had been neglected. The Government is committed to continuing this investment in the seven year period of the national development plan when a further £2 billion will be invested. I welcome this.</P>
      <P>I hear much criticism of the health service but very little account is taken of the excellence of the service being delivered in our hospitals and GPs' surgeries. It is easy to criticise the health service. Health is such an emotive issue that headline grabbing issues will always evoke a response. If money were the answer to its problems the health service would be perfect.</P>
      <P>Some elements in the administration of our hospitals must be examined. I am currently engaged in a study of performance appraisal. Have we ever examined the mean for operations in various hospitals? For example, if two consultants in one acute hospital carry out 500 heart by-pass operations in one year and in another hospital five surgeons carry out 750, questions should be asked. In an era of openness and accountability details of all private operations should be made available to the public. The public should know how many private operations are being carried out by surgeons who also have a public remit and if a surgeon's public contract is being honoured. We have never conducted such a study which would give an indication of what is happening in the private and public health sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> I commend the VHI which has given good private health insurance cover for many years and I also welcome the element of competition which has been introduced with the arrival of BUPA. Can the Minister of State explain the risk equalisation element of the Bill? When Deputy Cowen was Minister for Health and Children he revoked the risk equalisation element in the 1998 health Bill. It was said at that time that the market would reduce in size and that people would not get insurance. It was also predicted that VHI would go out of business. It was feared that disaster was about to befall the private health sector. None of these things happened and the market has expanded from 33% in 1994 to 46% currently. There was never a greater number of older people in the private health insurance market, VHI was never more profitable and its profits are even greater than BUPA's total income in Ireland. Some contend that risk equalisation makes competition impossible but I remain to be convinced of this. I hope the Minister of State will give an informed opinion on this matter. In the United States and Australia risk equalisation has disappeared. It could be argued that if risk equalisation is removed from the market better competition and greater cost effectiveness will result. I hope the Minister of State will refer to this matter when she replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a health insurance authority is a welcome development but its terms of reference must be clearly outlined. It must preserve community rating and pricing policies must be monitored to ensure transparency. Such monitoring would facilitate the operation of the sector and provide greater stability.</P>
    <P>Are the Minister's hands tied by the Bill? Will it be necessary to amend the legislation frequently as the private insurance market evolves? Can the Bill not allow regulations to be made without the need to return to the House every time a change is to be made?</P>
    <P>I support the main thrust of the Bill and I look forward to a better system of private health insurance as a result of its enactment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time of unprecedented economic boom and a bulging Exchequer it is necessary to make root and branch changes to our health system. We have a dual health system. A patient who has money will receive a service and one without money will not. This is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step we should increase the income threshold for eligibility for medical cards. The current income limits are so low that a husband and wife lose eligibility if their income exceeds £135 per week. A couple with an income of £140 per week cannot afford private medical care. A husband and wife with two qualifying children do not qualify for a medical card if their gross income exceeds £168 per week and a single person will not qualify for a medical card if his or her gross income exceeds £93.50 per week. How many people could exist on a weekly income of less than £93.50? This is absurd. It was never <Col N="39" /> intended that this should happen. Only the very poor qualify for the general medical service.</P>
    <P>The Government should more than double income limits to bring 450,000 more people into the medical card scheme. The Minister for Finance, in his December budget, should set a limit of £10,200 per annum for a single person under 66 years; a limit of £16,820 per annum for a married couple under 66 years; and a limit of £19,720 per annum for a married couple with two children. This would place eligibility levels on a par with tax exemption levels when adjusted in the budget.</P>
    <P>Given the existing income restrictions, is it any wonder there is such pressure on the secondary care hospital system? At present, 31% of the population is covered by a medical card at an average cost of £291 per year, a total of £337 million. To increase this by 450,000 people to 1.6 million people or just over 40%, which is an increase on the present figure of 31% of the population, would cost an estimated £130 million gross. The existing agreements between the IMO and the Department of Health and Children, allows for up to 40% of the population to be covered. This proposal is in line with the agreements with the Irish Medical Organisation. There will not be any need for any further negotiations. It could be introduced by the Government simply by making a political decision.</P>
    <P>While the total cost would be somewhere around £130 million, the net cost would be much less because those not currently covered by the GMS system, can claim a refund in excess of monthly expenditure of £42 for medicines and all medical expenses in excess of £100 for an individual, or £200 for a family per year against income tax. A disproportionate number of those to whom extended cover would apply, will be young and therefore, less likely to impose a full cost on the Exchequer. Furthermore, the gross cost to the Exchequer would be reduced as fewer people would present at hospitals and there would be a saving in secondary care costs. Even this should only be an interim measure. There is a good case for going much further and for transferring from secondary care to primary care, more of the resources to tackle the health needs of the population.</P>
    <P>Poor people suffer more and die younger. According to the ESRI research for Irish men aged 55 to 64, higher professionals have a death rate of 13 per 100,000. For the semi-skilled groups, this rose to 22 per 100,000 and to 32 per 100,000 for the unskilled manual groups, that is, the mortality rate was almost three times higher among the lower income groups than the professional groups. Access to general practitioners and medicines in primary care, together with access to hospitals when needed, would help reduce the number of deaths among poorer persons. In addition, pharmacists should be encouraged to become more directly involved in primary care, through medicine profiling of patients and minor injury treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Some estimates suggest that more than 50% of people do not take medicines correctly. Hospital doctors and general practitioners are often under pressure and patients do not always revisit the doctor if they have an initial bad reaction to medication. They simply stop taking the medicine or do not take the correct dosage. Often minor changes in the drug usage or advice on medication and use of, for example, alcohol or tobacco at the same time, can assist. Pharmacists who play an active role in hospitals giving advice on patient needs could play a more active role in giving advice on medication to those who do not need hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1999 was published earlier this month. I commend the inspector for the excellent work he is doing in the area and for bringing the report for last year forward in this year. Not many years ago, we had to wait three or four years for the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals which was totally irrelevant by the time it was published because conditions had changed in the preceding years. The general view of the report is that the treatment of those in need of psychiatric care in the State falls short of a standard deserved by people who are mentally ill and in deep crisis. It is a disgrace that this situation prevails.</P>
    <P>In his report the inspector castigated the level of service provided for those who are in mental hospitals. For example, the inspector has drawn attention to areas of concern in the quality of service provided. These include the substandard nature of some long-stay accommodation. He also pointed out that too many locations where the standard of furnishing and decor in which patients spent their lives was unsatisfactory. These long-stay institutions are in a bad state of repair and are symbolic of a different era. All pre-1900 constructed psychiatric hospitals should be closed immediately.</P>
    <P>There should be rationalisation of the system of keeping long-term patients who are severely disturbed in hospital with people who have a mental disability but who are not ill and with aged patients who should be at a geriatric hospital and not in a mental institution. There are approximately 300 patients, who have a mental disability and who are not ill, in in-patient care. I am excluding here, St. Joseph's unit in St. Ita's Hospital. This is an unacceptable situation. The inspector took a very serious view of this derogation of appropriate care delivery to all patient groups, to the mentally retarded, the severely mentally ill and the elderly in hospitals.</P>
    <P>The inspector pointed out that clinical review of long-stay patients on a regular systematic basis is essential. It is particularly important that the rehabilitation of long-stay patients is not neglected. In the case of elderly people, the physical disabilities of their age rather than any major psychiatric impairment was their main problem.</P>
    <P>The Government should introduce a policy of de-designation from psychiatric services and the <Col N="41" /> establishment of a high quality service for older people, to deal with their physical ailments. This has long been advocated by the inspector of mental hospitals who pointed out that no progress was made in this issue in 1999. This should not be tolerated. It is not acceptable that there is concern regarding documentary matters on patient care issues such as case note entries, recording reasons for seclusion, the reason for extending temporary patient reception orders or the reason why patients are not given their own clothes shortly after admission. These matters have again been raised in the report. It is not acceptable that there is a poor level of communication with relatives, as was pointed out or that there is an absence of complaint procedures and mechanisms in some services. The absence of public display of patients' rights under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, is not acceptable. The Minister must immediately ensure that this is corrected.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate has always been committed to moving away from the traditional mental health care delivery system, which was dominated by the doctor-nurse model, while at the same time, realising that the nursing profession will continue to provide the bulk of 24 hour treatment and care for the mentally ill. Perhaps the Minister will respond at the end of the debate to the view of the inspector that there is much evidence that other skills such as those of psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists are a necessary component of the delivery of the mental health services. Without them, adequate treatment and management in the broader sense, is more difficult. The absence or shortage of such professionals in many Irish mental health services represents a serious diminishing of service quality. What measures are being introduced to ensure that multi-disciplinary teams are available as recommended by the inspectorate?</P>
    <P>The inspector points out that it has been known for a long time that persons suffering from psychiatric illness have higher mortality and poorer life expectation than the general population. It is of great concern that there were 37 deaths in in-patient care in 1999, 14 by suicide. Surely, this level of suicide in our mental institutions is totally unacceptable. The Minister must immediately initiate an examination of why there is such a high level of suicide while people are in the care of State institutions. The 1998 report pointed to concern about prescribing of medication and the widespread prevalence of simultaneous prescribing of a large number of drugs. The inspector felt that a more organised approach to prescribing drugs was required in many services. The necessity of frequent reviews of patients' medication, particularly of long-stay patients, was again stressed this year in the inspector's report, as was the fact that medical prescriptions should be carefully written and signed. This is a very important issue and it is a scandal that such a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach is taken to the prescribing of drugs for long-stay patients.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> We must have a root and branch examination and change the way we deliver our mental health services. Since the foundation of the State, and not just during the term of the Minister, the mental health services have been neglected and under-funded. The provision of these services should be put at least on a par with the provision of the general health services, both in hospital and community care. There rightly has been criticism of waiting lists, but it would be a huge move for the mental health services even to reach the level of the general medical service.</P>
    <P>There is overwhelming evidence that psychiatric services concentrating on rapid response in the community setting are superior to the more conventional services. A community early intervention service should be introduced to provide a rapid response service for patients with severe mental illness. The service should see patients in their houses and other appropriate settings, including in general practices, community based day centres or relatively rarely in hospitals. An early intervention system should be multidisciplinary and include senior psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists and an administrator. The overall philosophy should be to try to treat all mental disorders outside of hospitals in the first instance, with particular emphasis on joint working with other agencies, home treatment when necessary and a collaborative approach to care which involves the patient as an active participant in all treatment decisions. There should be an aftercare service for patients discharged from hospital following treatment for psychiatric illness. The introduction of a community early intervention service should be carefully planned with particular emphasis on manpower planning.</P>
    <P>The substandard nature of long-stay accommodation is unacceptable. The institutions are in a bad state of repair and symbolic of a different era. All psychiatric institutions constructed pre-1900 should be closed and replaced by modern, purpose built hostels for long-stay patients. Facilities should be created in general hospitals for all acute admissions. Modern special secure facilities should be made available for the relatively small number of long-term, severely disturbed patients. These changes should address the issue of younger patients, functional psychotic patients and patients with intellectual disabilities sharing the same ward, as at present.</P>
    <P>Negative attitudes and the stigma of psychiatric illness need to be addressed. The low level of awareness among the general public of all areas of the service limits the accessing of those in need of the service. A public awareness campaign through the media should be introduced on all aspects of mental illness and positive mental health issues.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children accepted the genetic and neurological evidence that attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have a biological basis. There is severe under recognition and under diag<Col N="43" /> nosis of attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Ireland by health and educational professionals. Funding should be made available for a national prevalence survey of ADD. Extensive diagnostic ADD centres should be located in different regions and services for children and adults should be made available by the health boards as recommended by the report presented to the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In the first half of the 1960s an average of 64 people per annum died by suicide. The average for 1997-9, inclusive, was 462. We should recognise the urgency of introducing clear, systematic programmes aimed at the prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour. A strategic plan should be put in place to implement the recommendations in the report of the national task force on suicide which was published in January 1998. There are several Departments responsible for this and a procedure to co-ordinate the introduction should be introduced. Last year, 439 people died by suicide, 90 of whom were female. This is almost equivalent to two jumbo jets crashing with the loss of all passengers. We can think what the outcry would be if two Aer Lingus jumbo jets went down with the loss of all lives. A strategic plan is an urgent necessity, with time limits to ensure the full recommendations of the national task force on suicide are introduced.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State on bringing in legislation which will provide competition in the health insurance market. The Minister also stated very clearly that it will strengthen the basis on which solidarity between generations operates through community rating. This is a very important issue because we know of people who have wanted to enter the health insurance market but were not too keen to provide a community rating which has been a feature of the VHI since its establishment.</P>
      <P>I also note the Minister says the legislation includes provision allowing insurers discretion to apply late entry premium loading in specified circumstances. Now that we have more competition, which is very good, I hope people will get a fair deal and that those who may not have joined VHI in their younger days will be allowed a fairer deal at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of hospital development and building is unique which is most important in terms of having a balance of health services in the different regions. I listened to a person on &ldquo;Marian Finucane&rdquo; this morning describing the situation for people from the west who have to travel to Dublin, for example, for cancer treatment. One man described it very well when he said it is the difference between living in Rathgar or Rossaveel. Treatment might be available around the corner in Rathgar but it involves significant travelling for those from Rossaveel who perhaps have to go for cancer treatment a few <Col N="44" /> days a week. Hopefully this will change now that we have more hospital development.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to be in Galway last Monday when the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, laid the foundation stone for phase 2 of the extension to University College Hospital at a cost of £70 million. It will ensure a revolution in the health service in the west as we will have cancer treatment and cardiac surgery for the first time. These services were neglected by successive Governments and it is good these developments are in place. There will obviously be implications for private health insurance companies when the new services are in place. We already have VHI and BUPA and new companies may enter the health insurance market. I have been a strong supporter of companies such as VHI and BUPA. Cost increases have been sought in recent years and the Minister for Health and Children had to intervene to prevent the most recent VHI premium increase being granted. I am aware that considerations such as the possible effect on inflation were involved in that. It is very discouraging for people who have been with these companies for years to be faced with such increases.</P>
    <P>Some of these companies do not cater for the people who require services, nor are some of the services which are required provided. I have referred to the issue of orthodontic treatment on many occasions. There is a very long list for orthodontic treatment in the Western Health Board region. Many people cannot avail of the treatment because they do not meet the guidelines laid down. Health insurance companies should ensure that this treatment would be included within their own services.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case to be made for neurosurgical services in the western region. Such a unit is not included in phase 2 of the hospital development in Galway and I hope to see it included in phase 3, irrespective of whether it has been provided for in the national development plan. A very good opportunity exists for the development of such a unit in view of the fund raising which is ongoing in Galway. As it stands, people with brain injuries must travel to Cork or Dublin. This cannot be allowed to continue; we are all aware of the necessity to treat brain injuries quickly but that option is not currently available to people in the western region.</P>
    <P>The waiting list initiative is to be welcomed. I am a former member of the Western Health Board which made a very strong case to the Minister for such an initiative. The board has received a very positive response in terms of funding. I hope funding will be provided on an ongoing basis as hospitals and health board chief executive officers need to know what funding will be available to them at different times of the year.</P>
    <P>Given the number of nursing homes throughout the country, it is very important that health boards would continue to get contract beds in nursing homes. VHI, BUPA and other insurance <Col N="45" /> companies have a role to play in this regard. Nursing home costs are increasing. A subvention was introduced seven years ago in 1993 and the rates have not been increased since. It is high time that nursing home subventions were increased. Many people who do not have health insurance cover find it difficult to pay increased nursing home costs.</P>
    <P>Tuam Cancer Care Organisation was founded specifically to help people who did not have health insurance cover. For more than ten years, many families from Tuam and the surrounding areas have availed of the &ldquo;bed in the grove&rdquo; service in the Bon Secours Hospital. Sadly, the Bon Secours sisters have announced their intention to close their hospital in Tuam but we are trying our best to see whether that can be deferred. I debated the issue with the Minister of State last night.</P>
    <P>The Tuam Cancer Care Organisation has received money from local people, as a result of which it can provide a homely environment for cancer patients close to family and friends. This helps to alleviate a very difficult situation for many people who may be financially or physically stressed. I commend such groups for becoming involved in this area, although in an ideal world such care should be provided through the health services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville spoke about suicide, an issue which must be examined. He also referred to psychiatric hospitals. The number of patients in such hospitals is falling rapidly. There were formerly more than 1,000 patients in the hospital in Ballinasloe but the number has fallen to 300. Many patients are moving out into the community and that creates new challenges for the construction of new buildings and the movement of staff from major hospitals into the communities in which patients live. While this is a very positive development, resources are required to ease the transition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the element of competition to which the Minister referred and the re-examination of the community rating situation. I would also welcome the introduction of increased competition in the health insurance market in order that people may be able to avail of such insurance at less expensive rates. Competition will help companies to keep costs down and provide good services for people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which will contribute to the development of more competitive and innovative private health care at a time when the burden of public funding on the health care system is becoming unsustainable. It is very important that we clear the way for fundamental reform of the health care system. This Bill will help to deliver that much needed reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is the first part of a two phase process, the second stage of which will involve the conversion of the VHI into a semi-State body with a full commercial mandate, paving the way for full <Col N="46" /> privatisation at some stage in the future. There is a risk of people cherry-picking business and that should be avoided.</P>
    <P>Insurance schemes covering out-patient, GP and dental services will be removed from the scope of the legislation. The core changes proposed by the Bill relate to the alteration of the health insurance contract. Health insurance subscribers face staggering premia depending on the subscribers' age and the length of their insurance contract.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks the introduction of a lifetime community rating which will allow insurers to add a late entry surcharge for people over the age of 35 who purchase private health insurance for the first time. As identified in recent market research, there is a demand for a greater choice in the health insurance market.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at the barriers that prevent new insurers entering the market. Consumers have seen the value of meaningful competition in many sectors, most recently in banking, telecommunications and air travel. It is important to have open competition in the health insurance area. I note from press clippings that BUPA is opposed to the proposal requiring it to give £20 million over three years to its competitor, the VHI, which is highly profitable.</P>
    <P>We saw recently where Esat developed on the back of Eircom's infrastructure. I am not familiar with the charges but it made millions on the massive development of Eircom. The company was eventually floated and sold. New entrants to the market should not be penalised. The case is comparable to that of a new supermarket coming into a town and the existing large supermarket feeling obliged to subsidise the new entrant. Perhaps I am missing something but I would like to have the matter of the charge placed on BUPA clarified. It begs questions from the point of view of free competition and prevents meaningful competition. Why is it necessary? How is it justified? Is it EU law? Consumers want competition which is the life blood of any trade. You cannot have competition and an open market and, at the same time, ask your competitor to pay a charge.</P>
    <P>The VHI plans to introduce age related products under the Health Insurance Bill but we must look at community rated primary care products and GP cover. As regards State aid, apart from the question why taxpayers' money should be put into the private medical market, it is a further means of distorting the market, favouring the dominant player. These proposals will not help to develop competition nor will they benefit the consumer. There should be four or five insurers in the market but they have not come in because of the barriers to competition. There are 31,000 people on the waiting list and perhaps they should be asked for their views on the matter. We have a two tier system &ndash; those who can afford to pay consultants and those on the waiting list. The benefits that accrue from PRSI payments are very small. PRSI accounts for 20% of a wage, taking the employer's and employee's contribution <Col N="47" /> into consideration. Deputy O'Keeffe said £15 billion extra has been put into this area but the test is how it has been spent.</P>
    <P>The Health Insurance Act provided, in the interest of the common good, for the regulation of the business of private health insurance. The Act required health insurance undertakings to operate in accordance with community rating. There is provision under the Act for minimum benefit where undertakings cannot provide less than a specified level of cover. It also provides for risk equalisation &ndash; undertakings to share community risks. In a well heeled economy there are people who can afford to pay a premium of £1,200 and additional sums for members of their family. However, I am concerned about those who cannot afford VHI or BUPA premiums, the 31,000 people on the waiting list. They must be not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I know of a case where a lady was waiting for an appointment for Beaumont Hospital. The scanning facilities were not available and the secretary could only give an appointment for months in advance but the consultant's private secretary could make one within two weeks. I have nothing but the height of praise for Sligo General Hospital. It does outstanding work. The doctors and general managers there are quite efficient. However, every hospital should be judged according to how it deals with private and public health care. Public health is a major issue and I would relate it to a business. I look on someone who comes into my constituency office in the same way as I would a customer and give everyone an equal service. There is no regard for the fact that people who visit their GP under the medical card system can be quite ill and in need of hospital services urgently.</P>
    <P>We are funeral directors and a few months ago the son of an elderly lady came to see us. She had been discharged from Sligo General Hospital and was waiting to be called to Dublin for a scan. Unfortunately, the lady died and her son was aggrieved that she did not have the scan before she died. He did everything he could to have his mother brought to Dublin but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the VHI and other health insurers are to be allowed to charge higher premiums to people who are over 35 when they first take out insurance. It also modifies the principle of community rating. The loading on first time insurers over 35 will be laid down by regulation. It is important to clarify what this regulation will be. Those who take out health insurance before reaching the age of 35 will not be subject to any age related loading for basic health cover.</P>
    <P>It costs businesses £280 to pay a salary of £200 to an employee. Employees are seeking a minimum wage of £4.40 net. It is regrettable that so much money is being paid to the State in PAYE and PRSI for which the employees receive nothing in return in terms of benefits. They have <Col N="48" /> as a consequence no option but to join a private health insurance scheme such as that operated by some businesses. What we have, therefore, is a double-barrel system. Employees should be able to opt for a form of health insurance. From their point of view, employers are paying for cover which is never availed of as employees are obliged to take out private health insurance with either the VHI or BUPA.</P>
    <P>The question of entitlement to a medical card has been raised. It is outrageous that the cut-off point is so low. It currently stands at £19,000. No regard is had to the position of children attending third level who come from a large family and whose parents are operating on a shoestring budget. Should they require medical attention it will cost them £20 to visit a doctor. Their parents also have to meet the cost of accommodation. Because of the costs involved, students should be entitled to a medical card in their own right.</P>
    <P>There is a need for reform. We are talking about one of the biggest budgets in the State. The Minister of State mentioned that there are 31,000 on the waiting list. The actual figure is considerably higher. Many patients are frustrated and have lost faith in the system. The orthodontic service is a joke. Children identified as being in need of such treatment at the age of ten may not receive it until they reach of age of 15.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to a private nursing home I was informed that it did not maintain waiting lists because of the numbers seeking such accommodation. There should be a nursing care facility or unit within each community. In the latter years of their lives elderly persons are placed in accommodation 25 miles from their homes. Without a subvention they find it almost impossible to secure accommodation in a private nursing home closer to home.</P>
    <P>Those issues are somewhat removed from the Bill which deals mainly with private health insurance. It is important that there is regulation and a concession is granted to those who join a private health insurance scheme at the age of 65 whereby the loading on the premium payable is not excessive. Within a few years the VHI, like Eircom, will offer shares for sale. It is unfair, therefore, that new entrants to the market are being penalised by having to make payments to the VHI which can cherry pick the market. There is a need for competition. The VHI can increase its rates when it suits. Two years ago it was not making a profit; today it is making a huge profit. Why? The answer is not that consultants have dropped their prices, but that the VHI has increased its premiums. It has a monopoly.  Those with a medical card do not have a choice. People are forfeiting a holiday in order to take out insurance cover with the VHI. The ideal situation for the Government is for each of the 31,000 patients on the waiting list to take out such cover. It is wrong that patients have to wait due to the fact that they are not members of a private health insurance scheme. There should be a comparable State scheme under which patients would receive <Col N="49" /> the same level of attention that members of the VHI or BUPA receive from consultants. Members of the VHI who are guaranteed appointments within a week rarely come to my clinic. The people who come to see me are those waiting indefinitely for a hip replacement or cataract operation.</P>
    <P>Because of the enormous pressure exerted on public wards there has been a move towards day wards with little time for convalescence. Elderly patients are often sent home early to be cared for by a health nurse, a service that is both inadequate and over-stretched There is one health nurse in the Ballymoate region alone to provide follow-up treatment. This is an area at which the Minister must look. In the United Kingdom the very young and the elderly receive regular visits from health visitors on leaving hospital. This is the time at which tragedies can happen.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill which deals with the well-heeled in society. In the area of public health care the problem is not money, but benchmarking the dedication and quality of service provided by consultants who are being paid handsomely by the State for their work in public wards. It is important that those who have the wherewithal to pay for a private consultation receive the same level of treatment and within the same time span.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bill. It is regrettable that an ideal opportunity has been lost to restructure and introduce meaningful reforms to the health service to ensure better use is made of the enormous sum of taxpayer's money invested. A sum of £15 billion has been expended during the lifetime of the Government. In spite of this, there is chaos. The Minister of State and all those involved in the Department must realise that there is something radically wrong with the service. We are near the bottom of the league table in Europe. The introduction of this Bill could have provided an ideal opportunity to restructure and refocus the health services.</P>
      <P>The Bill introduces competition into the health services, which is welcome in as far it goes. However, that is not a priority with the public. They know that those who hold health insurance are a minority. It is good to have health insurance. Those of us who are covered in that way are aware of the safeguard we have.</P>
      <P>The VHI has been a wonderful asset and benefit to many individuals and families. There were no difficulties in dealing with it. If a person had a need in terms of consultant's fees, etc., an up-front payment was made and if a person was entitled to cover for charges, payment was made without question. That alleviated many hardships and concerns in families who were unfortunately visited by serious illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrival of BUPA has introduced competition. However, given that the VHI was first involved in this area, it is important that newcomers are not allowed to cherry-pick. The Bill <Col N="50" /> provides for the loading of certain categories of cover. We must be careful about this, especially if parallels are drawn with the loadings that occur in other areas of insurance. It is the thin end of the wedge of more serious developments where people covered by private insurance could be loaded for any number of reasons, as is now the case with motor insurance. I hope we do not allow loading to become an integral part of the cover people may obtain in the future.</P>
    <P>A health service which will deal fairly with those in need of medical care and treatment is important. Real competition will occur only when the consultants can be convinced to enter meaningful dialogue with all partners involved in the delivery of the service. We could be easily critical of the consultants and the part they have played in the premium increases paid by many people. The Minister and the Department must have the determination to tackle the problems faced by consultants and to address the issue of the huge charges passed on to the consumer, the scale of which appear to be protected by the consultants. If these issues are not addressed we will, unfortunately, continue to have a two tier system.</P>
    <P>Public representatives have been told repeatedly that those who have the ability to pay, be it through insurance or otherwise, will be treated almost immediately while others must depend on the public health services and wait for treatment. Tragically, those on waiting lists often die. There is no equality in the health services. According to the Minister, there are 31,000 people on the waiting lists. The numbers are probably far higher. It is an indictment that there is something seriously wrong, which must be tackled.</P>
    <P>To where does one look for the reasons the health service is not working? Does one look to the Minister and the Department, to the health boards, who deliver the service at local level, or to within, to the structures in the hospitals? None of these aspects can be isolated. An overall plan is required, but neither the Government nor the Minster have one. The services are in chaos. How can they be rescued?</P>
    <P>It is of little value to say there are vested interest groups protecting their areas. I do not accept that as a reason for the chaos. The health boards were established at a time when the demand on the health services was not great and when patients' anticipation of cover was not as demanding as it is today. Can we restructure the health boards?</P>
    <P>Rather than address these questions we have task forces, committees and reports. As a member of a health board I find that at every meeting I attend we are over burdened with reports from various groups, all of them involved in a roundabout way with the health services. However, they have very little input into the delivery of service to the patients, the people who are suffering.</P>
    <P>While we have lost an opportunity with this Bill, I call on the Minister to immediately address the problems in the health services in a comprehensive manner. That would include the health <Col N="51" /> boards. Administration within the health boards is top heavy and increasing because many of us demand greater access to, and an extension of, existing services. That is natural at a time when greater funding is available from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>How can this be reconciled with increasing waiting lists? We all know that in our health board areas additional funding was provided for the waiting lists initiative programmes, yet I do not see any positive response. Nothing has changed. Where has the funding gone? Has it been squandered on administration, other task forces or new reports? It is difficult for a Minister to know where to start. Something needs to be done across the health services.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that in the current economic climate a greater number of people would be entitled to medical cards. However, the opposite is the case. Fewer people in the Western Health Board area have a medical card now compared to five or ten years ago. That should not be the case. Many people asked the Minister to ensure cancer patients were given medical cards. I am a member of the Western Health Board and at its last meeting I suggested that we should try to do something in this regard. However, I was told that while such patients would not be excluded on the basis of income, the primary factor must be medical need. The people receiving treatment for cancer and their families are worried about how to pay for such treatment, particularly if they are not lucky enough to be included in an insurance scheme. I ask the Minister to make free medical services and treatment available to the increasing number of people who suffer from cancer.</P>
    <P>Initiatives should be introduced to eliminate waiting lists. I want to bring to the Minister's attention the situation in relation to orthodontic treatment in the west. It has been impossible to appoint an orthodontist in the Western Health Board area in the past ten years. If a person was appointed, he or she stayed only a short time. This resulted in a huge backlog of orthodontic treatments. Because there is no orthodontic specialist in the Western Health Board area, the health board is encouraging people to go to private specialists and it will pay the bill. Another alternative is to find adequate treatment in Northern Ireland which is readily accessible and cheaper, despite the distance involved in travelling. That is a damning indictment of a strangled system.</P>
    <P>The school dental service no longer exists or is piecemeal and patchy. Can the Minister call that a service? This is in spite of the fact that a former Taoiseach welcomed an initiative to give everyone a toothbrush which would encourage them to pay more attention to dental hygiene. It is unbelievable that the Minister, the Department and the health boards misunderstand what is happening.</P>
    <P>Simple treatments, such as cataract operations and hip replacements, which mean a lot to many <Col N="52" /> people in our ageing population because it will give them reasonable comfort in their old age, are being denied to them. I recall trying six different hospitals in late November or early December last year for a person who had been waiting a year and a half for a hip replacement. The person's family decided to provide the money necessary for the operation. I tried Croom hospital, Cappagh Hospital, University College Hospital Galway and every other hospital with a proficiency in hip replacements. However, despite the fact we have a two tier system, not one of the hospitals could carry out the operation prior to February of this year. The person, who was in intolerable pain, had to suffer for an additional four months. Yet the Minister will outline the great things he and the Government have done for the health service. That is a sham.</P>
    <P>I was told 18 months ago that a decision was pending in the Department about the acquisition by the Western Health Board of Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe because the Franciscan Sisters had decided not to continue the excellent service they had provided since the hospital was established. Every month since then I have inquired of the chief executive officer of the health board about the matter. Will the Minister tell me what is holding up the acquisition? The delay is causing concern among the staff and the population in the area who have relied on a service in Portiuncula Hospital over the years. If this delay continues, people will become suspicious and their confidence in the hospital will be eroded. I do not want that to happen. It has provided an excellent service over the years in my constituency, not only as a maternity hospital but also in other specialities, such as coronary, medical and surgical care.</P>
    <P>Last night we discussed the closure of the Bon Secours Hospital in Tuam. The response of the Minister of State was a disaster. This facility could be adequately reconstructed for the services needed in the area, but the Minister of State said that was not possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to participate in this debate on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000. Private health insurance plays an important role in the provision of hospital services to a large proportion of the population. This Bill is, therefore, important. I understand the key change in the Bill relates to the definition of health insurance contracts which form the basis for any insurance arrangements offered by <Col N="53" /> insurers. The principal change in the Bill will be removing from the existing definition the scope with which insurance plans are solely concerned, namely, ancillary health services such as out-patient and general practitioner services. The proposed removal of ancillary health services from the regulatory framework has been carefully considered by the Minister in the context of facilitating the development of insurance cover in this area. I therefore welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate my good friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, on her appointment to the Department. This is my first opportunity to speak on a Bill which the Minister of State has presented to the House.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the debate on this issue. For a considerable period of time I have been involved, in one form or another, with the health services. It is interesting to note that a number of speakers seemed to point the finger at the Minister, the Government or the Department for the failure of a person to get an appointment with a consultant, a hospital bed or whatever.</P>
      <P>A particular interest of mine is an area which is now referred to as intellectual disability. Prior to this Government coming into office, successive Governments had failed in that area. It is interesting to note people from all parties contributing to this debate and referring to mental handicap and other disabilities &ndash; physical, sensory and so on &ndash; yet when they were in a position to do something about this area, they failed. I am pleased to say that since this Government came into office, £127 million has been spent on issues relating to intellectual disability. It is the intent of the Government to deal with all other major issues relevant to those with a disability. That is a tremendous record of achievement and one that should be acknowledged in the House.</P>
      <P>As late as this month we had interesting despatches from the Department in relation to the whole focus and change in the speciality areas of autism. I want to record my congratulations to the Irish Society for Autism and in particular to Nuala and Pat Matthews who have done Trojan work on the development of much needed services. Specific projects currently in the Department are worthy of approval and the sooner the society can get sanction, the sooner the service will be in place. I encourage the Department to look favourably on the society's submission because it has a tremendous proven track record. I want to refer to an area where I am aware the society is experiencing some difficulty and that is the bureaucratic system it has to go through to avail of funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear Deputy Higgins support me on this issue. When the society wants to make a purchase, on many occasions it has to go through the local health board and the Department. That can take many <Col N="54" /> weeks and months and, in the meantime, some other group may come along and, for want of a better description, pull the mat from under the Department. A fund should be available to the Department whereby groups which present a worthy project can be quickly given clearance to go ahead.</P>
      <P>The other issue that has been discussed is that of medical cards. The previous speaker indicated that fewer people in his area have medical cards now than was the case heretofore. It is tremendous that fewer people require medical cards. Rather than bemoan that fact we should acknowledge that because of the current economic climate, people have more money in their pockets and therefore they do not qualify for a medical card. They do not qualify because when this Government came into office it decided to double the income limits for those who qualify for a medical card, in particular the group over 70 years of age. We should be careful about what we say in the House. Are we saying that there are fewer people with medical cards who are experiencing difficulty and hardship or are we saying that because of the current economic climate, they have more money in their pockets and that is the reason they do not qualify for a medical card?</P>

The medical card guidelines have been greatly increased and a new sector has been introduced &ndash; the age group from 70 to 79. These are welcome developments and it is important that we record them in the House.</P>
      <P>We should acknowledge that an extra 55,000 people have received hospital services in the past two years. That is a tremendous record. To put a figure on what we are talking about, my understanding is that the day to day spending on health services is in excess of £3.5 million. That is a tremendous expenditure.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is privileged to have as its chief executive officer the eminent Mr. Donal O'Shea and his management team. I congratulate Mr. O'Shea on the handle he has taken on the delivery of health services in that region. I congratulate him and his management team on their success to date and wish them and the chief executive officers and management teams of the area boards continued success.</P>
      <P>A tremendous amount of good work has been undertaken, some of it by the Department, the Minister and, more importantly, the Government. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has moved on a number of important issues to which previous speakers referred, including bed capacity, waiting lists, A&amp;E services, services for intellectual disability and so on. The authority has an innovative ten point action plan to tackle waiting lists for admission to hospitals in its region based on agreed principles of equity, quality of service and accountability. I am honoured to be chairman of that authority, which has made tremendous strides in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We decided our approach to tackling the number on waiting lists should be grounded on a number of principles. They include that the ERHA would ensure that access to health care would be based on need for services rather than ability to pay or geographic location; that the authority would safeguard equity of access and maintain the agreed proportion of public and private patients treated; that it would actively pursue initiatives to reduce waiting times for those requiring services; that patients have a right to <Col N="56" /> accurate information about their likely date of hospital admission; that GPs must be given full and relevant information on waiting times so that they can best assist their patients to choose a consultant or hospital, which is an important issue; that the authority will assure evaluation of the outcome of procedures and treatment; that structured arrangements must be in place in each acute hospital to ensure that the organisation and management of elective procedures and waiting lists and waiting times operate efficiently and effectively; that ongoing validation of waiting lists should be a key feature of waiting list management systems and that the new authority must co-ordinate action on waiting lists and intervene to offer patients an option to obtain treatment in other centres where they could not get earlier treatment in the hospitals they attend. Those principles were put forward following a wealth of intelligence gathering and contributions by personnel involved in the delivery of health services who recognise that following such principles presents a way forward to overcome some of the difficulties experienced in the delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>We also asked each hospital in the region to urgently validate its waiting lists to ensure a process is put in place in each hospital to provide appropriate treatment for patients within a minimum waiting period. Hospitals that are in a position to carry out additional work have been asked to provide the ERHA with details and costs of additional procedures they could carry out. I congratulate Mr. O'Shea on shaking the can in this regard. He asked those in charge of one hospital why they had a six month waiting list for procedures, whether ENT, cardiovascular or hip replacements. When he went to another hospital and learned from those in charge that they did not have a waiting list for procedures, he informed them he would buy those procedures to reduce the waiting list for them in the other hospital. He has managed to get an additional number of procedures carried out in that manner.</P>
    <P>I am amused that some speakers seemed to point the finger at the Minister or the Department for a person failing to get a hospital bed. One Deputy indicated that he tried to make telephone contact with the consultant and hospital manager concerned. Surely we are not saying the Minister is responsible for the procedures performed and the administration, admittance and well-being of hospital patients or of people who attend a GP, public health nurse or health centre. If that is the area for which the Minister responsible, let the House say that. We have highly paid chief executive officers of hospitals. I was concerned at the amount of media coverage the post of the former chief executive officer in Tallaght Hospital received and I have no regrets about him no longer holding that position. If my memory serves me right, that man argued for and eventually got a salary of £135,000 a year, and that was three or four years ago. That man had a management team and I presume not one of his managers was <Col N="57" /> on a salary much less than half or no less than a quarter of his salary. I presume his management team was made up of eight to 12 personnel and each had a manager in each of their departments and each of their managers had a supervisor. If we want to talk about who is managing what, let us start pointing the finger at those concerned.</P>
    <P>Tremendous strides have been made in identifying the problems in the delivery of health services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Negotiations to address those problems have taken place under the auspices of the chief executive officer of that authority and hospitals in the region have agreed to carry out additional procedures and, in some instances, such procedures have been carried out.</P>
    <P>The authority has asked hospitals to examine the potential for day surgery and an increased use of existing theatre capacity on an after hours basis or when existing clinical staff have booked annual leave. It is a disgrace that people are on waiting lists for procedures while some hospital theatres may not be open on a particular day in the week.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is doing tremendous work. It has identified the areas in which it can improve A&amp;E services. Much of the difficulties experienced by the authority are not due to a lack of funding from the Department but to a shortage of personnel due to the current buoyant economic climate. The authority cannot recruit the required personnel and I am not talking about medically qualified people.</P>
    <P>The authority has developed units for the elderly. In one such unit in my constituency 30 beds are empty because the authority is unable to recruit the necessary personnel, whether they be nursing, medical, domestic, administration or clerical. Blockages are created in acute hospitals due to beds being occupied by the elderly. We should examine why such a high level of nursing personnel are required to staff nursing homes. Surely another level of care attendant could be established which would reduce the criteria for nursing personnel in nursing homes. Surely we could have another level of care attendant in place which would help reduce the nursing criteria.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his cardiovascular and cancer strategies, on addressing the issue of youth homelessness and care of the elderly as well his other innovative strategies. I also congratulate a relative of mine on his recent retirement &ndash; Paddy Murphy of the Irish Heart Foundation, who did tremendous work in the health area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is probably one of the most important we will have in the short length of time remaining for this Government. If we can bring some sense to the huge problems in this area we will have done some good and the contributions so far have been quite good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not facing up to the problem here. We are like a man putting four new tyres on a car <Col N="58" /> when the engine is banjaxed and needs a complete overhaul. That is what the health service needs &ndash; it is like an old car that works on a stop and go basis. Health care is like a lottery in that one may be lucky when going to hospital and see a consultant or surgeon.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with the area of insurance and I encourage everyone to have health insurance cover, which is vitally important if health breaks down in a family. That can be very costly and may even push people into bankruptcy. I might not agree with all of Deputy Callely's points, but this is a worry about which people are very conscious. The cost of health insurance is prohibitive. If we do not realise that we are not living in the real world. There are people with large incomes for whom it is not a difficulty; the premium is deducted at source and is not noticed, but the majority of people are moving into what Deputy Michael D. Higgins rightly termed the poverty trap. They are caught between the cost of private health insurance and the non-availability of medical cards. For that reason, I welcome the statement from our health spokesperson, Deputy Gay Mitchell, that when Fine Gael returns to Government in the next few months cover under health cards will be available to a wider range of people on higher incomes. That is very important, as many families are worried by this. I am aware of families who have opted out of VHI because they cannot afford it. They do not quality for medical cards and they are in dread of experiencing poor health, which can happen in any household.</P>
    <P>Something must be radically wrong when one considers the amount of money needed to provide a very poor and inadequate health service for a country of three and a half million people. Something is wrong when one considers the astronomical premia for VHI. I welcome competition in this market, though whether different terms or a level playing pitch should be available to them is an issue with which I do not have time to deal today. I live in a Border constituency and if one is referred to a hospital in the North for treatment, one's VHI does not cover that treatment. That may surprise some people, but it is a fact. If a person takes ill in Northern Ireland one is covered for treatment, but if one is referred there by a consultant one's VHI cover does not apply. This must be addressed if we are serious about cross-Border health care and co-operation.</P>
    <P>If there are services available in Northern Ireland that are not readily available here, people should be able to avail of them and <i>vice versa</i>. People from the North should have the same freedom to attend Cavan, Monaghan or Drogheda hospitals. As has been said, it is cheaper to get orthodontic treatment in the North than it is here. Doctors are advising people with children on waiting lists who have orthodontic problems &ndash; and such problems occur particularly among girls in the developing years &ndash; to take those children to the North, where they can be treated immediately. It is less costly but it is not covered. However, in the Republic it costs from <Col N="59" /> £1,500 to £2,000 to have braces fitted. That is an astronomical figure, but I cannot query it as it seems to be the standard rate. The same procedure can be carried out in the North for £150 to £200. Obviously, something is radically wrong with charges and health costs here.</P>
    <P>I encourage everyone to have some form of health cover if they can, whether it is private or a medical card, though the latter must be expanded to deal with the widening gap in this area. Deputy Callely said it is great that fewer people have medical cards, but fewer people are qualifying. While incomes have gone up to take people out of the medical card threshold, those people cannot afford the cost of private insurance. If a prominent Government backbencher is not aware of that problem, is the Minister of State aware of it? Is she aware of the concerns of parents in this regard?</P>
    <P>What is the problem in the health care area? I have no doubt it is administration. We have excellent consultants and nurses. In my experience they are wonderful, but it is well nigh impossible to see them. Why are people given appointments for 10 a.m. in the morning and not seen until 4 p.m. that evening? That is a regular occurrence. I do not blame the consultant; I blame the administration. I do not expect a person to be seen the moment he or she arrives at the hospital, an hour is acceptable, but the situation I outlined is not unknown. I recently spoke to a person who spent three months in hospital before being discharged and given an appointment for 10 a.m. on a certain date. The day before his appointment he checked and was told to come in at 10 a.m., but he had not been seen by 4 p.m. and went home without being seen. As he said, he did not mind as he was back to full health, but he was concerned by the number of patients in the waiting room &ndash; mothers with small children, elderly people and people who were quite ill. Nobody seemed to be going anywhere. Occasionally a nurse would come out to apologise and say the staff were coming to them, but nobody seemed to be moving. Everyone seemed to be brought in at the same time &ndash; 10 a.m. &ndash; yet by 4 p.m. very few of them had been seen. That is an administration problem that needs to be addressed. It is unacceptable. If the health service were a private business, the receiver would have been sent in long ago. I do not blame the doctors, consultants, surgeons or nurses because they have a job to do. Doctors see their patients in their surgeries and they cannot be aware of what is happening in their waiting rooms.</P>
    <P>The delays result from the way the system is run. The system of health boards is outmoded and is a cumbersome method of administering health. There is nothing but complaints and that is not just in one health board but nationwide. It is a nightmare if patients are referred to Dublin from my region, as happens occasionally.</P>
    <P>Cavan General Hospital was supposed to be a regional general hospital. People campaigned for <Col N="60" /> it and contributed generously to it. Services were to be available there which would be on a par with any of the Dublin hospitals, but it is not happening. They are not available. A neighbour with a minor ailment who lived within two miles of Cavan General Hospital was sent to Monaghan Hospital 30 miles away. This man is elderly and his wife is an elderly woman who does not drive. She depends on her neighbours to drive her to Monaghan to see her husband. Had he been in care in Cavan General Hospital, she could have afforded a taxi to take her to the hospital occasionally or her neighbours would have driven her to and from the hospital because it was a short distance. Instead, her husband is 30 miles away. Having lived together for 50 years the State has finally separated them. It is outrageous and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Another story that states the position in a nutshell is that of a nice old lady who fell in her garden and sprained her hand. Her husband drove her to the hospital where she waited for hours. She said to me afterwards that there were about ten people to take her name and address and not one to put a bandage on her hand. She summed up the health service. We are snowed under with administration, applications and forms but, when one goes to the coalface, one cannot get the service. It is time there was a radical overhaul of the health boards. They are cumbersome and bogged down with bureaucracy, such as members' expenses and all that nonsense, and people cannot get the reasonable service they seek.</P>
    <P>An issue relating to Cavan General Hospital has surfaced which has caused great annoyance, which I said I would raise in the Dáil and on which a public meeting will be held in Cavan town on Monday. It concerns the mammography machine. It was recommended for the hospital and was put in place in 1997 with a special room prepared for it. Three years later, we have been told that the mammography machine will be transferred to Drogheda and that a mammography service will not be available in Cavan General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Every day I come to this city I listen to the radio and hear Marian Finucane's show or another of those marvellous programmes where people can ring in and talk to someone who will listen to them. I heard a programme on Tuesday on the issue of cancer, cancer care and the early diagnosis of cancer. I heard a senior consultant say to Marian Finucane that, with the mammography machine, a cancer the size of a pinhead can be detected and early treatment can be given which will guarantee a cure. Early diagnosis is important and he encouraged women not to be afraid and have the test done. Something that was new to me was that breast cancer is an ailment which can also afflict men. The machine can make an early diagnosis of the problem and people should be screened every two years.</P>
    <P>Despite the generous contributions of people through the Friends of Cavan General Hospital <Col N="61" /> towards the cost of this machine, it will now be transferred to Drogheda and the women and men of Cavan who wish to avail of this service can travel there. I have no objection to Drogheda Hospital and I know the machine is needed there to service that area. However, if the women of Cavan, north Leitrim and Fermanagh are expected to travel to Drogheda, why can the people of Louth not travel to Cavan? Why must it be all one-way traffic? I have given a pledge in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> and I have committed my party leader, on our return to Government, to have that mammography machine returned to where it belongs and put in place for the service of the people of Cavan.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable and people are outraged and it is only an indication of what is happening in rural Ireland. The Minister must take the blame for the services provided by the Government. Deputy Callely asked if the Minister were expected to be responsible for the everyday operation of hospitals and admissions. He is not expected to do that, but he is expected to be responsible for policy and he alone is responsible for it. If the system does not work, he must take the blame. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has been in office for a number of months. It was expected after the previous Minister that there would be a new breath of life and new developments in health care and there has not been. The system has failed and I am sorry to say that and that the Minister of State's officials must listen to that. However, if we do not speak the truth, we will not achieve change and deliver a health service to the people. For a small nation of 3.5 million people, we are making a heavy job of providing a reasonable health care service.</P>
    <P>There were references to the various afflictions of small children, and to babies born with autism. Autism is a terrible and shocking problem. Nothing was done in the past and we were all guilty because we did not know how to address the problem. I know parents who, in desperation, campaigned and raised funds to bring their children to a clinic in Boston where some success was attained. It is an especially difficult problem. I hope as a result of the recent court case a positive development in the care of children with autism will occur and that we will realise the terrible difficulty young parents have with a child suffering from this ailment. We can have success and bring about improvements. There is the problem of diagnosis and consultants having different opinions but I have been told that, if there is an early diagnosis and the child is worked with from as early an age as three &ndash; it is often seven or eight before the problem is realised and much damage will have been done by then &ndash; it can have an effect. This has been indicated in various areas of mild mental illness.</P>
    <P>More can be done. There is the problem of both parents having to work to provide an income and children being left in care. In such circumstances the condition may not be diagnosed in time because the carers have so many children to <Col N="62" /> care for. There is the further possibility of the parents being too tired in the evening to notice. Some would say they should rear their families but I do not accept that. That was fine when the mother stayed at home but that scene has changed. I draw attention to these problems in the area of mild mental handicap. Much can be done if conditions are addressed at an early stage. Great progress could be made which would not only bring relief to parents but give such children an opportunity to have a meaningful life.</P>
    <P>There are many similar areas which need to be addressed. I have raised the issue of a mammography machine and I hope the Minister of State has taken note of it and that she will ask the health board why this insult has been heaped on the people of my county and region. Perhaps we would have a positive answer from her before Monday night regarding this machine being left where it belongs to provide a service. If the Minister of State were to do that, it will have been worth my while standing up in the House this afternoon. Other issues will be raised by other Deputies. These issues are not unique to my area. This is a national problem and a national policy is required to address it.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Since 12 June last I have considered the authorised officer's report on IIB Bank Limited, formerly known as Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited, and I have forwarded a copy, as permitted under section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, to the High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the Moriarty and Flood tribunals, the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> On 27 July last the Ansbacher inspectors obtained a High Court order requiring the issue of a letter of request to the Royal Court of Guernsey in the Channel Islands for the purpose of assisting the inspectors. I expect that it will be six months before this inquiry can be completed.</P>
    <P>On 28 July the High Court decided to quash my appointment of an authorised officer to Dunnes Stores Ireland Limited, and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited, under section 19 of the Act. My appeal against this decision will shortly be lodged with the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>On 31 July the inspectors to National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited submitted a further interim report to the High Court relating to this inquiry. I hope the inspectors' inquiry will be concluded shortly.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated, five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing at present in my Department under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited, and Kentford Securities Limited I hope to receive final reports on a number of these companies in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, Garuda Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the DPP. I have no further information on his intentions with respect to any of these reports. My Department has separately instituted proceedings for breaches of the Companies Acts arising from the report on Faxhill Homes Limited</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

      <P>The Minister stated on 13 June last that the authorised officers in her Department would complete their investigations within a few weeks. Is it correct that one of the main reasons there has been a delay in bringing some of these cases to completion is that crucial information has gone missing from her Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the delay in bringing into the public domain the results of any one of the investigations she has undertaken is undermining the confidence of many people such as myself who would have supported the initiatives taken by the Minister when she assumed office? Is she in a position to inform the House when members of the public are likely to be able to assess the outcome of any of these <Col N="64" /> significant investigations? Does she accept that people's confidence is being corroded and their cynicism enhanced by virtue of that fact that some years after she assured the public that they would receive this information it has yet to become available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bula report, which was a section 14 inquiry, has been in the public domain for some time. It was quite legitimate to place this report in the public domain.</P>
      <P>With regard to Ansbacher, National Irish Bank and National Irish Financial Services, these companies are under investigation by High Court inspectors. Affidavits were put before the court based on what we had discovered in the preliminary inquiries under section 19 and under the Insurance Acts. Those affidavits revealed a considerable amount of what was discovered by the authorised officers. It is now a matter for those inspectors to report to the courts. As the Deputy is aware, they do not report to me.</P>
      <P>I expect that the NIB inquiry will conclude shortly. The Ansbacher inquiry will probably take up to six months. As the Deputies are aware, IIB had a role in relation to the conduct of Ansbacher related business and it was for that reason I referred that report, in the first instance, to the inspectors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is aware, given that he initiated inquiries in this area, that under law I am prohibited from bringing section 19 reports into the public domain. To do so would be a criminal offence. If we were to change the law we would be faced with a different set of circumstances and a preliminary inquiry of that nature would have to be conducted in a different fashion if it was going to become a public document. However, I have no doubt that the matters which are the subject of section 8 inquiries will enter the public domain reasonably quickly. The remaining report which the authorised officer in my Department is working on will be concluded shortly. Where a section 8 inquiry is warranted, I will proceed to seek the permission of the High Court to appoint section 8 inspectors.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is also aware, we have sought to gain access to Dunnes Stores for a considerable period and there have been a number of court cases in this regard. Obviously, nobody is above the law and we cannot proceed until we obtain appropriate authorisation from the court to proceed in relation to that inquiry in particular. Some of these matters have been delayed because citizens have not co-operated with the authorised officer and others have been delayed as a result of litigation. It is fair to say, however, that in less than three years an enormous amount of work has been carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Revenue Commissioners shows that on foot of the authorised officer's report into NIB, at least £16 million in tax arrears has been paid and the Revenue has not yet settled with a number of other people who are named in that report. The reports to which I refer <Col N="65" /> are being highly successful in ensuring that increased revenues accrue to the State. However, there are limitations and difficulties have arisen. If people do not co-operate, it takes a great deal of time to complete investigations. It is painstaking work to go through accounts which date back 20 years in many cases.</P>

      <P>I accept that this is a complex matter. If we leave Bula aside, is the Minister stating now that most of the inquiries and investigations she has initiated have effectively moved outside her control? I understand there are three section 8 investigations under way. When the Minister says she will be able to bring these into the public domain in the near future, is she able to provide a precise date in that regard? If one considers the history of this matter it becomes apparent that the Minister has given the same reply on successive occasions at Question Time. Is the Tánaiste in a position in October 2000 to indicate when the section 8 investigations will be brought into the public domain?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte who had responsibility in this area knows, section 8 inspectors report to the court, they do not report to me. It is a fact that I receive copies when they make interim reports to the court. The inspectors report to the High Court, of which they are officers, and it is a matter for that court to decide. I expect the two section 8 inquiries into NIB to be completed very soon. The recent interim report the inspectors submitted to the court would indicate that the final report will be completed in the near future. The Ansbacher inspection will probably take up to six months. The three inspectors, Mr. Justice Costello, Ms Noreen Mackey and the accountant, Mr. Paul Rowan from Northern Ireland, are working extremely hard. They have interviewed a considerable number of people and I expect they will finalise their report soon. Two tribunals of inquiry have been sitting for exactly the same length of time. All this very important, if sometimes unsavoury, work will change fundamentally the culture that exists in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have not simply waited for the result of these inquiries. We have proceeded with the publication and discussion of the Company Law (Enforcement) Bill. I proceeded to bring in legislation in this area because of what came to light during these inquiries. Extraordinary work was done for a relatively small sum of money &ndash; a later question has been tabled about the cost of these inquiries &ndash; and it is only a matter of a short time before the section 8 inspectors' reports will be before the court and in the public domain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> The Minister stated on 30 June last that she would make a decision on the IIB report in a few days, yet it took her nearly two months to refer the matter to Mr. Justice Costello. Why did this delay occur?</P>
    <P>The decision in relation to the Dunnes case, which the Minister proposes to appeal to the Supreme Court, was taken ten weeks ago. Why has there been a delay in lodging this appeal with the Supreme Court?</P>
    <P>The Minister has been quoted as saying that shocking revelations are contained in the reports. Is it not the case that she and her party are delaying disclosure of these revelations and positioning themselves in the light of a future general election?</P>

      <P>On the Deputy's last supplementary question, if such were the case it would be an abuse of office. Deputy Bruton made a similar suggestion the other day. I utterly reject that suggestion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was briefed by the Secretary General of my Department this week and he is aware of the facts in these matters. The Dunnes Stores case has not been appealed to the Supreme Court because we are awaiting the written judgment of Mr. Justice Butler and there is a dispute between the two sides in the matter.

      <P>A later question has been submitted regarding cost, but I believe it is in the region of £3 million for all the inquiries. The National Irish Bank report alone has brought in £16 million and it is not settled yet. On foot of the Ansbacher report a considerable amount of money has come into the Revenue Commissioners from some of the individuals named in the report. The inquiries have been extremely cost effective compared to other forms of inquiry. They have also been effective in revealing information because of the nature of the inquiries and the co-operation of some institutions, which I acknowledge.</P>
      <P>I made a decision within a couple of days of receiving the IIB report. For legal reasons the formalisation of that decision was made later. I made a decision, however, about the course of action to be taken and I have followed that course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment market in Ireland has been transformed in recent years, driven by increased employment opportunities. Employment agencies have responded by developing their services to meet the needs of employers and potential employees. Such services are increasingly provided over the Internet and indeed across borders by the same means. The Employment Agency Act, 1971, is based on the notion of services being provided from an establishment whereas increasingly these services are delivered by means of e-business. It is against these changing circumstances that I asked my officials to review this legislation. As part of that review the social partners and other interested parties will be consulted over the coming months. Best practice in other EU countries will also be examined with a view to the possibility, where appropriate, of introducing improvements to our current legislation.</P>
      <P>I am, however, satisfied that the current procedures governing the granting of employment agency licences are adequate. I am satisfied that the vetting procedures prior to issue of licences are adequate. The labour inspectorate of my Department also enforces this legislation with its other duties.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rights of foreign workers, I assure the House that foreign workers receive the same protection as Irish workers under this country's employee protection legislation, including the Employment Agency Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>Should the Deputy have evidence of a breach of this Act or other employment rights legislation, I would welcome further information so that the matter can be investigated fully by the labour inspectorate of my Department.</P>

What action is the Minister of State taking with regard to that matter?</P>

      <P>If examples of breaches of legislation are known to the Deputy I ask him to notify me and my Department. The Deputy is aware of the specific criteria under which agencies are awarded licences. Persons must be of good character, the premises must pass health and safety regulations and monitoring of the work of agencies, in the form of checking daily newspapers, is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have undertaken a review of section 7(2) of the 1971 Act which rules out the charging by an employment agency of a fee solely for agreeing to seek employment for another person. Discussions with my officials indicate that some strengthening is required with regard to that section. Agencies are not entitled to charge fees of employees. Pay<Col N="68" /> ment is made by employers. There is a need to improve that section of the Act. It is 30 years old and needs to be updated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that a complaint has been made to the Minister of State's Department regarding this matter. However foreign nationals are afraid to provide the Department with the evidence required for a prosecution. Because of these circumstances, will the Minister of State review the legislation with a view to strengthening the investigative powers of the Department or ensuring that, under the work permit legislation, controls are placed on these employment agencies and people who come into the country are not abused, as is happening at present?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received representations from a number of interested parties in relation to the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987. In addition, both myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, have received deputations, and meetings with other parties are in prospect concerning the matter. I am also studying the recent report of <Col N="69" /> the UK Competition Commission which is relevant to this matter.</P>
    <P>The final report of the competition and mergers review group which I published in May contains a recommendation, by a majority, that the groceries order be repealed and replaced by some form of legislation or regulation in relation to the grocery trade but not to include a ban on below cost selling.</P>
    <P>I am at present finalising my consideration of this recommendation and I will bring my proposals to Cabinet shortly, after which a decision will be announced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the pressure coming from to repeal the groceries order? I am sure she has been told in the meetings to which she referred that the cost of items covered by the groceries order compared to the cost of items and the rate of inflation on items not covered by the groceries order, shows up very favourably and that food inflation is running at at least 2% less than the rate of inflation in this economy. Where is the pressure coming from to repeal this order and why will she not introduce clarity to the position? Why are we going on about it? I have cuttings from the newspapers which read, &ldquo;Bread and milk will be slashed if Harney has her way&rdquo;. We have this image of a Bodicea in favour of the consumer, striking out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I do not write the papers, no more than himself. He has a bigger say than I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Later on, we have the Tánaiste being quoted as saying that she has an open mind and that she thinks that perhaps nothing favourable will accrue to the consumer. Which way is the Tánaiste feeling today and will she communicate certainty so that people know where we stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as Deputy Rabbite knows, I do not write the newspapers or the headlines. I am sure he is aware of that. Second, he asked me where the pressure is coming from. I do not think there is any pressure coming from any source except to say that every expert who examined this, recommended it, including the company law, mergers and review group established by my predecessor when he was at the Department. I gave an undertaking in this House, which I want to honour, that I will meet all the groups with a view on this. I will meet some groups on Monday. I also want to study the report in the UK. The figures quoted by Deputy Rabbitte will be disputed. However I am conscious that the UK report stated that the practice of persistent below cost selling operates against the public interest when conducted by major players such as Wm Morrison, Safeway, Sainbury's and Tesco, or those parties with market power, which I will bear in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, any expert group that has examined this, since it was first initiated, has recommended that it be changed. Others have said that if it is such a good thing, let us extend it to all sectors of the economy. The onus is on me, as the Minister, to consider all the issues, to form a view and to have an open mind before I bring proposals to the Government. I have an open mind &ndash; if something is fulfilling a need, we should keep it. If something can be improved as a result of getting rid of something, we should consider that. We should bear in mind what was said in the UK too. The evidence from the UK, where there is no such thing as a groceries order, clearly is not very satisfactory. Therefore, we would be foolish to ignore the findings in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>On the timeframe for this, I draw the Minister's attention to a letter of 19 April which she sent to me and probably to a number of other Deputies, in which she mentions, in terms of the subsequent publication of the review group report, that within two months she would be meeting all the parties. However, she is telling the House today that she will meet groups and have further consultations next week. This is entirely unacceptable. Would she not accept that the uncertainty surrounding the Government's intentions in this regard is preventing investment in the industry, particularly in small retailing and food businesses, and that this order has been under suspended sentence now for almost four years? We need to bring finality to it.</P>
      <P>Who has the Minister met? Has she met RGDATA or the large multiples? Who has the Minister's ear in this regard? Surely she can give us an indication if she will make a decision before Christmas, because in the Official Report of 20 April I asked her if she would make a decision within six months. She replied: &ldquo;I hope it will be made much sooner than that. It will probably be made within three or four months&rdquo;. Six months have elapsed and we have no decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether I met RGDATA. I did and I met the IFA and several other groups and I have more to meet next week. I gave an undertaking that I would make no decision until I met all of the groups involved. On finality, any order of this kind will always be reviewed from time to time. It is not ever going to be written in stone. We will make a decision now. Successors of mine will make other decisions and give other considerations to this and other matters. The Deputy can take it that proposals will be brought to the Government during October in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste refers to experts and their unanimous conclusions but does she accept that there is a social dimension to competition policy? Does she accept there are other experts, including the unanimous view of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business <Col N="71" /> that concluded that it would damage the fabric of provincial Ireland if this were to happen? You will not permit me to quote, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but may I ask the Tánaiste if she read the article by Ciaran Fitzgerald, the director of IBEC, who would be a soul brother politically, who said that tampering with the groceries order is not a real solution but an ideological one. He went on to say that tampering with the groceries order would do nothing for the price of mangoes in Moore Street or for the consumer. Does the Tánaiste agree with that IBEC view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this matter with Mr. Fitzgerald on several occasions. I told the Deputy earlier I had an open mind. I am not a consumer of mangoes. The Deputy knows much more about mangoes than I do. I would hardly know the price of a mango. Mangoes are not covered by the groceries order as fruit and vegetables are excluded. Whatever we do with the groceries order will not affect mangoes.</P>

I said in this House before that I do not believe in the perfect market; that is why we need regulation. If we were to end up with one or two dominant players, then the fabric, not just of rural Ireland but also urban Ireland and the facilities and services available to consumers would be greatly undermined. We want to see fair competition and choice. Not everybody can drive hundreds of miles to an enormous multiple.</P>

Will she frankly admit to the House that when it comes to the representations being made by the small independent retailers in Deputy Treacy's constituency and other constituencies, she has not got a hope in hell of putting it through the Fianna Fáil back benches?

However, it would have been a huge discourtesy to that group of people as volunteers, chaired by Deputy Michael Collins, if we were not to give due consideration to all the findings in that report and to then talk to those parties who wanted to see me and express a view. I do not have a closed mind and I am not an ideologue. I am not like Charles Handy, who said that if it is not broken, fix it. If something works we should leave it alone. We are not trying to do things for ideological reasons &ndash; we are trying to make things work. We want to ensure we have competition and choice and I do not accept that a failure to clarify whether it is staying or going has made any difference.

      <P>The costs incurred on recent company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department amount to about £3.92 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff who are working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations are being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Of this amount, the cost of the inquiries into National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, which are being undertaken by High Court inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, currently stands at about £2.5 million. None of this has yet been recovered from the two companies.</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the 1990 Act provides that the cost of a section 8 inquiry shall be defrayed in the first instance by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

As I have indicated in the House on numerous occasions, it is my intention to request the High Court to require the full recoupment from the companies concerned of the significant costs of these inquiries on their completion.</P>
      <P>Of the balance of £1.42 million, the principal areas of expenditure have been incurred on the investigations of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, £814,000, Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, £203,000, Faxhill Homes Limited, £143,000, IIB Bank Limited, £65,000, and various other investigations, £25,000. The sum also includes £170,000 in respect of the State's portion of the costs of liquidation of the group of companies associated with the Clonmannon retirement village which have recently been paid. These companies were the subject of a company investigation in 1994-95, initiated by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

      <P>If I caught sight of any of these reports I think I would agree with the Minister that they are good value for money. However, we are back to the subject matter of the earlier questions. We cannot yet judge that for ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it from what the Minister said that it is her intention to pursue National Irish Bank and associated companies for the costs incurred as a <Col N="74" /> result of that inquiry. When does she think that inquiry is likely to be concluded?</P>

      <P>They are High Court inspectors. An interim report was made by the inspectors to the High Court in July this year. I believe they have made enormous progress. There were two sets of litigation earlier in the inquiry which delayed the inspectorate. I believe the reports will be finalised very soon. It is my intention to apply to the High Court to have the costs recovered as I do not believe the taxpayer should have to fund the cost of these inquiries.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the cost to date is £3.9 million which does not include staff costs or a major element of the legal costs. If that is the case have we an estimate of the total cost of these investigations, taking these two considerations into account? Does the Tánaiste believe the budget of £3 million for the directorate of corporate enforcement will be inadequate to deal with such investigations in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not, because the company law enforcement office will have a huge number of legal staff, which we do not have. I do not know what the cost would be on the Vote of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, but the sum of money being allocated initially is appropriate. If it is not we will get more resources, but I do not think we should look at this simply from a resource point of view. The changes in the Company Registration Office, together with these inquiries, are changing the culture. I do not believe we will ever again see a situation where at one time there are 13 major inquiries taking place. The failure to enforce the law in the past and to have an appropriate enforcement mechanism, such as the new company law enforcement office, led to a situation where the law was ignored.</P>
      <P>Regarding costs, the bulk of the £3.92 million concerns the NIB inquiry which cost £2.5 million. The rest has been pretty good value for money given what we have achieved and the revenues which have gone to the Revenue Commissioners as a result of the inquiries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Has anybody in the Minister's Department had time to devote to assessing the efficacy of these investigations in terms of cost, efficiency and time? We have seen more of them in the past decade than in the previous five decades. Has the time come to examine whether this is the best way to police corporate governance and how much of this was taken on board during preparation for the Companies (Amendment) Bill currently before the House which provides for the director of enforcement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody in the Department has done a value for money audit, but I came to the conclusion fairly early on that it was not satisfactory that a Minister or a political <Col N="75" /> decision should decide whether or not an inquiry into a company should be carried out. That is why we established the group under Michael McDowell, now the Attorney General. That was a group of interested persons from a wide cross-section of society, including the trade union movement, lawyers, people with company law expertise and public servants from different Departments. They concluded this was the direction in which to go, and it is right that we should have a separate independent office to enforce the law. Unless we have successful prosecutions we will not change the culture successfully. Successful prosecutions together with the new office will change the culture regarding the enforcement of company law. Some decisions made by Deputy Rabbitte in relation to resources allocated to the Companies Registration Office are making a fairly major difference in relation to registration and such matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The package of taxation and company law measures introduced in 1999 and again this year to address problems arising from the use of Irish registered non-resident companies &ndash; IRNRs &ndash; for undesirable purposes provide that all companies have to be linked more closely to the State and interface more fully with the Revenue Commissioners and the Registrar of Companies, through compliance with a range of new requirements in company and taxation law.</P>
      <P>The key change is in the taxation area as a result of which all companies registered under the Companies Acts are now regarded as being resident in the State for tax purposes, except for companies meeting specific criteria specified in the Finance Act, 1999. The effect of this is that the IRNR structure is no longer generally available.</P>
      <P>A feature of the ongoing implementation process is a strong co-operative effort on the part of Revenue and the Registrar of Companies. The registrar has power to strike companies off the register where they fail to supply Revenue with certain information. Following requests from Revenue, the Registrar of Companies is proceeding with the strike-off process against 1,400 companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will presumably be familiar with a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> which stated that 24,000 companies refused to reply to the Registrar of Companies, which seems a great many, and that this phenomenon still exists. Does he think in his consideration of the problem that new legislation is <Col N="76" /> required? I presume he saw more recently in the newspapers that no less than Marko Milosevic, son of the Yugoslavian despot, has his company headquarters in Baggot Street or somewhere here in Dublin. It would appear that the practice is still taking place. What is the follow-up in a situation where companies do not bother complying with requests from the Registrar of Companies when information is sought?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Chair's indulgence to place more statistical data on the record. I am absolutely satisfied that the existing legislation pertaining to the Companies Registration Office and the new package of measures introduced in the past two years are having a very positive effect and it is not necessary to introduce new legislation.</P>
      <P>An examination of the incorporation of companies over the past three years gives a clear indication that the system is beginning to become very strict and is working well. In 1998, 20,874 companies were incorporated in Ireland; 18,604 in 1999 and 14,638 up until the end of last month. The Revenue Commissioners have written to 68,072 companies and are preparing to write to a further 11,000 seeking certain information for taxation purposes on foot of the new provisions in the Finance Act, 1999. Arising from this exercise, Revenue has, to date, asked the Registrar of Companies to strike off 3,000 companies for failure to supply the information in question. Following discussions with Revenue, particularly in regard to the identification of the companies in question &ndash; some may have changed their names and addresses &ndash; 2,174 notices of strike-off were issued by the registrar. I am informed that, of these, approximately 770 companies have responded positively to the Revenue Commissioners who are now preparing a formal request to the registrar to proceed with the strike-off process against the remaining 1,404 companies. A further 7,000 are in the Revenue pipeline for strike-off and work is ongoing in regard to identifying other companies for possible strike-off from the balance of the 68,072 companies. In addition to strike-offs arising from this exercise, the registrar has separately pursued a pro-active strike-off policy for some time in respect of companies failing to file their annual returns to the Companies Registration Office. For the period until the end of September 2000, as referred to by Deputy Rabbitte, 23,919 companies were struck off the register as compared with 31,159 in the same period in 1999. These figures include both voluntary and involuntary strike-offs.</P>

I accept the Minister's point that it will not be possible in the future to operate with similar ease but what about those who have a plate in Dublin or elsewhere in the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It means the Revenue Commissioners have issued a serious document to each of these companies seeking certain information under certain specific criteria for registration in Ireland with regard to taxation etc. and asking them to respond by a particular date. Unless the companies can respond positively to all of the questions by a particular date, the Revenue Commissioners notify the Registrar of Companies to de-register the companies forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is happening on an ongoing basis. Approximately 1,000 IRNR companies per week have been struck off since the introduction of these new measures. These strike-offs must be carried out in a legitimate and fair manner. People must receive due notice and due process must be adhered to. Communication is two-way; I stated earlier that of the 3,000 companies which failed to respond to requests from the Revenue Commissioners, 770 subsequently provided the required information and confirmed that they were in order. Those companies received clearance and the remaining 2,174 companies will be struck off the register. We are making tremendous progress and I congratulate the Companies Registration Office on the great work being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area that may warrant review in terms of possible inadequacies in the Partnership Act, 1890, the Limited Partnerships Act, 1907 or the Investment Limited Partnerships Act, 1994 and I will consider whether it is appropriate for referral to the Company Law Review Group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to ensure this matter is referred to the Company Law Review Group. Under the current legislation, if a partner dies, his or her estate can force the sale of the practice regardless of the profitability or damage that might effect on the firm's goodwill. Where a partner is found to be negligent, no proper procedures are in place to expel that partner and the partnership must be dissolved. This is 19th century legislation and the Minister must ensure that major changes are made to it. Partnerships comprise a huge part of the service industry which has been criticised in the past in regard to inflation and which requires a radical overhaul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a partner dying, the situation to which the Deputy referred would only apply if no other arrangements had been put in place. However, I share some of the Deputy's concerns which are outlined in a recently published book written by solicitor, Michael Twomey, and launched by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The UK has introduced legislation in this area but I must admit that until this question was tabled and I read the background notes on the existing inadequacies, this matter was not on the legislative priority list. I will consider the matter and ask the Company Law Review Group for its opinion. Mr. Twomey suggests that the number of partners should be limited to 20 and that mechanisms should be put in place to resolve disputes between partners and to deal with difficulties which might arise on the death of a partner if prior arrangements have not been made. I thank the Deputy for tabling this question and I will examine the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that she will refer this matter to the Company Law Review Group and that it will be given priority treatment there? There are situations in which the 20 partner limit is being circumvented through the establishment of two partnerships of perhaps 20 partners each. These situations have not been tested under the law and serious questions could arise. Will the Minister review this matter urgently and ensure that legislation is introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say the matter is as urgent as some others. Prioritising involves rating var<Col N="79" /> ious matters in order of urgency. My Department's first priority is the completion of the company law enforcement legislation and the insurance legislation. The proposals in the report of the audit review group will also require legislation and existing company law must be consolidated in regard to co-operatives, etc. Some of the matters raised by the Deputy merit consideration. Mr. Twomey's study deserves serious consideration by the Department and the Company Law Review Group which advises the Minister on legislative changes in this area on a biannual basis.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed with the decision of the High Court on 28 July last in this case. The immediate implications of the decision are that the examination of the books and documents of the two companies will be delayed further. At the same time, however, I had always expected that the High Court decision would be appealed to the Supreme Court, whichever side it favoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the gravamen of the rejection by the High Court to do with the fact that the inquiry overlaps existing inquiries? I ask that because I would like the Minister to comment on the very trenchant remarks of Mr. Justice Butler who said he found the Minister's appointment of authorised officers unreasonable and irrational and that it unambiguously flew in the face of fundamental reason and common sense. Mr. Justice Butler was in fighting form that morning and I would like to know the Minister's assessment of that without going into the detail of her legal advice on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I was extremely disappointed and have been strongly advised to appeal the matter. This has been before the court on a number of occasions. In November 1998 Ms Justice Lafoy refused to quash the appointment of the officer. That decision was subsequently appealed. The High Court judgment in July 1999 of Mr. Justice Kinlan was referred to the Supreme Court. It ordered a rehearing, and that was the rehearing. Mr. Justice Butler was very <Col N="80" /> strong in what he had to say. He said it was <i>ultra vires</i>, that I did not justify the appointment on the grounds of corporate governance, taxation, the interests of members of the public and possible illegality. It was a very strong judgment and my legal advice is equally very strong that it should be appealed. We are awaiting the High Court order. Apparently there is a dispute between the State and Dunnes Stores as to its contents. I hope that will be resolved shortly so that we can have the appeal.</P>
      <P>A section 19 inquiry, which is what it was, is a preliminary inquiry. The Act states that if the Minister has grounds to suggest that the affairs of the company are being conducted in such a manner as to cause creditors to be ignored or not treated appropriately, the Minister has grounds to seek a section 19 inquiry. It is a very basic provision. I was surprised at the judgment but we await the finalisation of the order and, I hope, an appeal to the Supreme Court. I hope that will be the end of the matter because, as Deputies know, it has gone on for a considerable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that should the decision of the High Court be upheld by the Supreme Court it would have major ramifications for the Companies Act, 1990, and the appointment of an authorised officer by the Minister or, in the future, the Director of Corporate Enforcement? What is the reason for the delay in receiving the judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know. I am told there is a difference of view between counsel for the State and Dunnes Stores as to its content and that is why it has not been finalised. The Deputy is correct, if this judgment stood in the Supreme Court it would have serious ramifications for all the inquiries under the Companies Act, but particularly section 19 inquiries, if it were the case that you were not entitled to take into account corporate governance, taxation and creditors being defrauded. The Act provides that if there are grounds to suggest that &ndash; it does not state it must be happening &ndash; a section 19 inquiry may be granted.</P>
      <P>This matter was before the High Court on two occasions and it did not quash the appointment. It was before the Supreme Court in relation to particular matters, which is why that court recommended a new High Court hearing after Judge Kinlan's judgment in July last year. I hope we will have the order soon and a Supreme Court determination in this matter as quickly as possible. There are time constraints under the Companies Act that prohibit certain things happening if a particular time has passed. It is important that the inquiry is carried out as quickly as possible.</P>

I understand from what the Minister said she is not in a position to tell the House when the Supreme Court might be seized of the matter. Without wishing to invite <Col N="81" /> her to make remarks in public that might be prejudicial later, in setting out the case for the authorised officer did she allege breaches of, or non-compliance with, company law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte may have a copy of my affidavit which is a long one. We vigorously defended the decision to appoint a section 19 officer. Clearly it was not because of what was arising in a different forum. That would have been a waste of money. My powers are under the Companies Acts. The tribunal of inquiry is not examining any matter under the Companies Acts and there seems to have been confusion on that matter. As the Deputy knows, we changed the time constraint recently and the issue is whether it can be applied retrospectively. We have changed to &ldquo;from the time the Minister becomes aware&rdquo; of certain matters rather than when they occurred. Under the previous law it was when they occurred, not when the Minister or the authorities became aware of certain breaches and, therefore, you were prevented from taking action. I do not know whether it applies in this case because the appointment had been authorised in advance. Time is of the essence in regard to these matters and it is right that we would have a speedy conclusion to the legal issues involved. That is why I hope we will have an early Supreme Court hearing and that is what we will apply for.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the authority's staffing has placed constraints on its capacity to deal with new complaints. However, I am fully committed to ensuring that it is adequately resourced to discharge its important statutory functions and I have taken measures to deal with the problems imposed by these constraints.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I sanctioned five new posts at professional level in the authority and it now has an authorised staffing number of 29: five full-time members; 12 professional staff &ndash; five legal advisers and seven economists; and 12 clerical-administrative staff.

      <P>Furthermore, my Department, with the authority, is involved with outside consultants in a study of the authority's operations with a view to having its future resource requirements assessed.

What I wanted to do was to assess the medium-term resource needs. That is the reason I asked Deloitte and Touche to speak to the authority and make an assessment. That is now to hand and it will determine the medium-term resource needs. One of the difficulties in a buoyant economy is that professional staff are being sought and paid higher levels of remuneration not only in the private sector but also in other public sector positions. Many of the staff who have left the authority have simply moved to other areas of public activity. In addition to staff numbers, there are issues to do with the rate at which staff are remunerated. We have satisfactorily resolved these issues. The new chairman, Mr. John Fingleton, who took up the position in the summer, is doing an outstanding job to resolve many of the difficulties and prioritise action for the authority.</P>

      <P>Six months ago the Minister admitted that the activities of the Competition Authority were being constrained by the lack of staff and promised to do something about the matter quickly. It does not matter that she and I agree on the new chairman, the fact is that six months ago the activities of the authority were being constrained. They still are, if not more so. Given that inflation poses the main threat to the economy, resources should be made available immediately to tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>We all wish that there was a closer correlation between the allocation of resources and the recruitment of staff, but in a buoyant market it takes much longer to recruit staff to public service positions in particular. There are difficulties in the recruitment of staff right across the public service at the levels of remuneration paid. This raises big issues for all sides of the House, but I am satisfied that the issue of the short-term resource needs of the authority has been dealt with. Any medium-term resource issues which arise will be dealt with following consideration of the Deloitte and Touche report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 14 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The National Roads Authority accident facts report 1998 showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on our roads were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks that they are prepared to underwrite. It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives, aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for motorists, including young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and subsequent claims. There are a number of such initiatives in place. For example, the Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the learner driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns. Greater attention to safety on our roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures at Government level. The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and policy recommendations for addressing these costs.</P>
      <P>The most effective way to ensure the most competitive quotes are available to the consumer is to have as many insurers as possible competing in the market. It appears that the implementation of EU legislation opening up the EU market to competition from authorised insurers in all member states has had a beneficial effect on competition in the market.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State a simple question. We are all appalled at the carnage on our roads and the overwhelming involvement of young drivers. When will the Government move on the penalty points system? Insurance companies point the finger fairly and squarely at the Government. This will be an important measure in restoring sanity on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy is in favour of a penalty points system. Consensus in the House would expedite consensus across the nation on the issue which is being considered by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy. Tremendous work is being done by the unit under his control. Various measures are being considered. There are many actors involved, including the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the National Roads Authority and many others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Driving Instructors Register which provides an insurance discount. What is the net benefit to a young driver in undertaking the Driving Instructors Register programme? Taking into account the cost of the programme, there is a loss of £50. What recommendations has the MIAB made to the Minister of State on a reduction in the cost of motor insurance to young drivers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Deputy on his appointment to the Front Bench and wish him well in his new position. To say that there is a loss of £50, taking the cost of lessons into account, is to adopt a narrow focus in assessing the net benefit. A more confident and assured young person in control of a mechanically propelled vehicle will pose less risk and contribute to the protection of other motorists and road users, be they pedestrians or cyclists. It is a good initiative which must proceed and which we must endorse. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board is doing excellent work. It comprises, among others, representatives of the insurance industry, the National Roads Authority, the various Departments involved, the haulage business, the motor trade and young drivers. I am awaiting its final recommendations.</P>

There was such a protest outside the House a couple of days ago. Law abiding <Col N="86" /> young people who need access to a motor vehicles to go to work cannot get insurance.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State familiar with the sheaf of correspondence I received today on behalf of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business? It includes a letter from his colleague, Deputy O'Flynn, saying he had attended such a meeting in Cork last week and was appalled to find that young drivers were being asked to pay premiums of £4,000 and £5,000 to get insurance cover, that this is a breach of the republican cornerstone of Fianna Fáil of equality for all and that these young drivers&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could have resolved this issue yesterday, last week, last month or last year I would have done it. I have given the issue a huge amount of time. I have had discussions and negotiations with insurance companies, people in the industry, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, the Garda Síochána and many others. We are doing our utmost to see if anything can be done to resolve this.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware it is a sad situation that young people can be charged up to £6,500 for motor insurance cover. That is very serious. What can we do? We need a consensus that everybody is prepared to support the introduction of reasonably tough measures to help to ensure that if people are expected to behave in a particular way and if criteria are applicable, the insurance industry may respond by taking that into account and provide cover.</P>
      <P>We have looked at schemes, such as the smarts car scheme, whereby a two seat car with a small engine would have a limited capacity and performance. The Ontario model for young drivers is under consideration by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and my Department. If we bring all on board, including the driver testers, we hope to make progress. It is extremely complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> No insurance company in Ireland today will underwrite motor insurance at a profit. As Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, I have a responsibility &ndash; as did Deputy Rabbitte &ndash; to ensure that there is a liquidity ratio within those companies and that they can discharge their obligation against claims made. I must balance that against the needs of the consumer and those looking for insurance cover. The companies must write off those losses against the profits they make on their investments. That is a very serious situation and it illustrates how precarious it is.</P>
    <P>The market is very small and many accidents involve young people between the ages of 17 to 24 years. The average cost of a claim for them is twice the cost of a claim for drivers from 35 to 40 years of age. The mature driver has fewer accidents and is a lower risk. We must find a formula to ensure that young people can get cover at a reasonable price for a reasonable type of motor car that is not overly powerful. We need consensus to achieve it and a great deal of co-operation from many people. It will not be easy. I will not make false promises in the House. I will do my best as quickly as I can to make progress.</P>

For the past three or four years members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party have been <Col N="88" /> talking about the Ontario system. When will there be any movement on it and how long must we wait for the Government to take any decision or pro-active stance on training young drivers, encouraging them to be safer on the roads and reducing their insurance costs? The Minister of State is three years in office. Must we wait for another three, six or nine years?</P>

Deputy Naughten said the Fianna Fáil Party has failed to act in this area. The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, introduced serious measures relating to speeding and drink driving to attempt to reduce speeding. We know the support he got for that, both in this House and across the country. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, has continued along the same lines. We are continually working together as a team&mdash;</P>

What can the Minister of State say to the tens of thousands of law abiding careful young people who need a vehicle to access their employment and who cannot get insurance cover? After all the talk here we have not got one practical proposition.</P>
      <P>What did the Minister of State mean when he said if we had consensus in the House it would speed up the implementation of the penalty points system? Nobody in the House has opposed it. It is an administrative question of when the Government will implement it.</P>
      <P>This is an acute problem. It is fantastic that young people who previously had to emigrate are working in the economy, but they cannot get to work because they cannot get affordable insurance cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that this year and last year the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which has overall responsibility for road safety, has revised its 1997 targets downwards because it is unable to meet its commitments in its document, which does not even touch on the issue of training young drivers or reducing the cost of insurance for them? Is it the case that he will go it alone on this matter? When will he get the <Col N="89" /> report from the MIAB and will he take action when he receives it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was a matter of going it alone I would have done it in October 1997. It is not possible to go it alone. I depend on the industry to give the cover, on the Garda to implement the law, on the Department of the Environment and Local Government to have certain regulations in place and on the NRA to make improvements in certain areas, including making changes to traffic, speed limits and so on.</P>
      <P>The young drivers divide into four segments. The highest risk includes those aged 17 to 19 years, the next highest risk includes those aged 19 to 21 years, the next highest includes those aged 21 to 23 years and the least highest risk are those aged 23 to 25 years. There are serious losses in terms of human life and insurance underwriting in the lower end of those segments.</P>
      <P>We are doing our best. I welcome the evidence of consensus here. I am trying to achieve consensus with all the different interests, players and actors who are deeply involved in this area. When I achieve consensus on which we can make progress, I will be delighted to tell the Deputy. We are doing our best.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate on health. This is an extremely important topic. If the Labour Party is in Government after the next election, I will want substantial reform of and policy changes in the health services, particularly in terms of access. There must also be a complete root and branch approach to abolishing the two-tiered health service.</P>
      <P>I was amused to hear some Government speakers in particular say that people are doing well and that things are changing for the better when they do not qualify for a medical card. That is not amusing. We must change the system to ensure that people on medical cards have the same access to health services as those who can buy private health insurance. We are not demanding that standards should be reduced but that they should be the same for everyone, including people on medical cards. Access to the service should be based on need, not on the size of a person's cheque book or on their ability to pay.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act. As the Labour Party spokesperson on health, Deputy McManus, stated, it serves to further separate primary care from hospital care by removing cover for general practitioners from community rating. I detect a market approach to this matter rather than an approach which embraces the fundamental concept of universal access to the health service. Surely the essence of the community rating concept is to ensure that cherry-picking does not occur at this or any other level? Every health Bill should be measured against the impact it has on reducing inequality of access to health care. We should not lose sight of the fact that immediate access to treatment is critical at primary or secondary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when announcements are being made about £2 billion surpluses and money is floating about, it is an indictment of the Government and a clear reflection of its failure that thousands of people have been on waiting lists for two years or more for elective surgery, such as cataract and hip operations, heart by-passes and cardiovascular operations. People get only one <Col N="92" /> chance at life and money should be spent to ensure they are treated.</P>
    <P>I have tabled parliamentary questions in the House on the provision of hip operations for people in the Westmeath constituency. I am sure the situation there mirrors that in other constituencies. I was told on 3 October that a Mr. X was placed on a routine waiting list for a total hip replacement two months ago. There is currently a two year waiting list for such an operation. I was told that by the general manager of the acute hospital services in the Midland Health Board. Mr. X is currently on a routine waiting list for a total hip replacement at Tullamore General Hospital and I was told that, having regard to the number of patients on the waiting list before Mr. X, it would be a number of months before he would be scheduled for surgery. This man was in the Army and served his country abroad and at home. His payback is to be left suffering on a waiting list until he gets to a critical level and then his general practitioner will try to force the issue. If that is what the health service is about, I or my Labour Party colleagues do not want any part of it. The Labour Party wants such people to have the same access to hip operations as someone who can pay £5,000 or £6,000 to have it done in three or four days in some of the private hospitals.</P>
    <P>There are significant staff shortages in the health service. People at all levels must work longer hours and often in demanding conditions. Staff are renowned for giving excellent service in medical support care. However, extra beds are often required. Mullingar General Hospital, for example, is still awaiting the go ahead to finish phase 2B in the capital programme. The £25 million required to finish phase 2B should be forthcoming to ensure that the commitment given to the people of Longford and Westmeath is honoured and there is no further delay. People should not have to wait. They are angry at the possibility, as the Minister for Health and Children said, that if things do not go well it could be another four years before it is completed. Otherwise, it will be ready in two and a half or three years. The hospital is waiting for an additional 60 beds. Those are the type of problems we are experiencing, despite all this money. I urge the Minister and the Minister of State, who is in the Chamber, to ensure that this matter is given greater priority. I know the project will shortly go out to tender &ndash; because it costs more than £1 million it has to go through the European tendering process &ndash; but it is vital that it be put on a fast track and that no further impediments are placed in the way of ensuring the completion of that hospital.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that there is a two tier health care system in place. Public patients with medical cards are left languishing on waiting lists while those with private insurance cover have instant access. It is time to end this inequality because one's <Col N="93" /> ability to survive should not depend on having a healthy bank account.</P>
    <P>There is even a problem getting medical cards. I heard Deputy Callely say earlier that there has been a huge increase in the income guidelines for eligibility. There was an increase for those aged 70 and over&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

        <b>: </b>I think he was talking about the Fine Gael policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but for the ordinary person eligibility should be based on a net income at a standardised rate. People do not get any credits and I agree with Deputy Browne that the income guidelines should be substantially expanded from their current position because if a married person goes beyond £138, they cannot qualify for a medical card. Deputy Callely had the gall to stand up here and say that is a sign of progress. Who do they think they are codding? They are certainly not in contact with the people who are deprived of medical cards. One has to be very poor to get free care under the general medical services scheme. The income guidelines are too low. Only the PRSI element is taken out of them. I am calling for significant changes in those income guidelines. It will be costly but we have to take steps to reform these income guidelines for eligibility for a medical card.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boylan referred this morning to people who have cancer. That is a traumatic event in anyone's life and I have no doubt that the Minister will appreciate that as much as anybody in this House. When someone receives the initial diagnosis of cancer they should be granted a medical card without being put through the wringer of an eligibility examination. That would give them some solace. I am sure the Minister is caring and compassionate and he should direct the chief executive officers of the health boards to immediately grant medical cards to people diagnosed with cancer and not put them through the eligibility guidelines wringer. He should put an end to that practice. Government policy lacks coherence. Our primary purpose should be to ensure that those who require access to health care get it. The whole system should be centred                           on the patient to ensure that those who need it get care immediately.</P>
      <P>It is not too long ago that we spoke in this House about junior doctors. It is vitally important to ensure that a career structure is put in place for junior doctors. I accept some progress has been made in that regard but junior doctors, some of whom have to work up to 100 hours per week, have told us that they are unable to give the appropriate level of patient care if they have been on their feet for hours on end. I hope that a proper career structure will be put in place for the people working in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the number of beds available for the elderly in various hospitals throughout the country. There would be an even greater need were it not for the amount of care <Col N="94" /> given by relations to elderly people at home. There should be a root and branch reform of the carer's allowance. I know this may not directly affect the Minister's Department but the Department of Health and Children has an input in this area. We have no detailed information about this matter. I put down a question on this the other day. There are conflicting replies on the number of carers in Ireland. Some say it is 50,000, others say it is 100,000 but only 15,000 are awarded the carer's allowance at present. That figure is due to rise to 20,000, but how many carers do not receive any assistance? It is time to prepare an adequate database and detailed information on carers.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we abolish the means test for the carer's allowance. The Minister, Deputy Ahern's officials told me last week that that will cost £150 million. The Minister told me last week it will cost almost £200 million and that if there were 100,000 carers, it would cost over £320 million at current levels of payment. If there were 50,000 carers, it would cost £125 million. Carers look after their relatives all hours of the day and night to avoid their relations having to go into institutional care. They receive a very small allowance of approximately £80 and it would be important for them to get some sort of respite care. It is time to commence the process of abolishing the means test for the carer's allowance. A substantial sum of money has been recovered as a result of the DIRT inquiry. We should give that money back to people who suffered in the early 1980s. This is one area where the Minister should ensure that some of that money goes to them.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about another area of the health service, which may have been referred to earlier by some of the Minister's backbenchers, and that is the orthodontic service, particularly for young people. Despite the economic affluence we are supposed to be enjoying, the waiting lists for orthodontic services are lengthening. Orthodontists throughout the country are working flat out; it is not their fault if treatment is not forthcoming. Many more people would get access to the service if the Department of Health and Children examined the recommendations of the Moran report which has been lying on a shelf in the Department for the past 18 months. That report referred to upgrading and refining the guidelines.</P>
    <P>The severity of a child's orthodontic problem must conform with the Department's guidelines which are nearly 16 years old. In a time of plenty, that drastic position should be changed. Parents who come to see me are keen to outline the difficulties in this area, particularly if they have young daughters. If a young girl's dental outcrop is only a millimetre less than what is in the Department's guidelines, she will not qualify for treatment. Young people in their formative years are desperately in need of treatment, whether it be braces or other orthodontic appliances. The parents who find themselves in that position, some of whom are on social welfare, disability benefit or whatever, have to go to the local credit union and borrow up to £2,000 because it is essential that treat<Col N="95" /> ment is given in time. Our methods of determining measurements for teeth outcrops are outdated yet lying somewhere in the Department is the Moran report in which there is a recommendation that guidelines which follow a more internationally accepted index should be implemented. I understood that the chief executive officers of all the health boards had agreed on a number of matters in this regard. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the recommendations of the Moran report are implemented without further delay to give hope to the many young people on the waiting list and the parents who must borrow to meet this significant cost.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party put forward proposals to reform access to health services, based on a universal health insurance scheme designed to bring the benefits of competition not only to some of our citizens but to all of them. Instead of a debate on the issue, we had a clatter of prepared statements from some of the Minister's backbenchers. I laughed when I heard the utterances of two representatives from my constituency. The two of them made the same point. It was a case of &lsquo;great minds think alike'. The machine producing the scripts was busy that week. Instead of scaremongering citizens, we want to ensure health services are developed at local level. That is why we put forward our proposals. We proposed the establishment of a national forum on health to engage those involved in health care, including patients who should be the primary focus in the debate on health care reform and future policy making in this area.</P>
    <P>I note from the White Paper that the Government undertakes to promote and facilitate not a national health forum for all but a private health care forum, which will bring together interests delivering exclusively private health care for some. This Bill is tinkering at the edges of addressing problems in this area. It is maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, tweaking a little bit here and there, but it does not propose a radical or fundamental reform. I may be wrong and stand open to correction but I believe the Bill weakens the safeguards established by a previous Government, including one of which the Minister was a member. The Bill is based on free market principles, yet it denies many access to that market. The Minister should rethink that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some people thought that, in absolute terms, the level of expenditure on health care had increased. I cannot deny that, as that is proven by the figures. However, our expenditure on health care is very far behind that of other member states of the European Union. One Member had the gall to say that is not the case, but various reputable European reports put Ireland very far down the line in terms of the percentage of our GDP spent on health care. The average spent by our counterparts in Europe is 8% compared to a little more than 6% here. We have much work to <Col N="96" /> do to bridge that gap. Previous speakers referred to those who will come under GMS, those who have private health care insurance and a great cohort that fall between those two categories. That cohort will be lost in the system. That is why we need to ensure all citizens have access to adequate health care services.</P>
    <P>We are one of the two or three European member states that spend less than 7% of our GDP on health care. That reflects that our expenditure on health care is not excessive by any standards. Given that, it is hardly any wonder that up to 40,000 people are on waiting lists for hospital treatment and that some public patients have to wait many months for an appointment with a dermatologist or ophthalmologist. Some people have to wait two years for a hip operation. That salient fact is enough to serve as a severe indictment of our health system. If it has to be reformed, let us carry out a root and branch reform of it so that people who hold medical cards are given the same opportunity to survive and live as those who have healthy bank balances and private affluence and can get access to treatment within days while others have to languish for two or more years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate opened on a general note and has taken the form of a general discussion on health services. The major cutbacks in health services began in 1985 and were implemented under the last Minister for Health from the Labour Party to hold office. No Minister with responsibility for health, apart from those in office in the past three years, has been given sufficient funding from the Administration of the day to implement measures necessary to provide a proper health service. When one hears of problems in the delivery of health services discussed by commentators or medical personnel on television or radio programmes, one of the comments made is that finance is not a problem. That is a major change that has taken place, particularly in the past two years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose quoted records, waiting lists and other data, but he may not have been aware that the start of the major cutbacks in the health services were implemented under the then Minister for Health, Barry Desmond. It is important to highlight that, as we are trying to move forward and improve on that situation. I do not want to beat the Opposition with facts and figures about the number of additional and new types of procedures being carried out, the new medical equipment being made available or the list of health centres provided. The last time health centres were built by health boards was in 1986. That programme was then suspended, but it was reactivated in the past 12 months. That is fact, not history. People like Deputy Browne might not like to hear that, but those facts and figures are available, if he wants to get into a verbal tussle on that point.</P>

      <P>That is only one aspect of our health services.</P>
      <P>While it may help a Minister or a Deputy to quote the latest case that features in the media to focus attention on his or her argument, I do not know if that helps the debate on this area. I was asked at a late stage to speak on this Bill and I was a little concerned about doing so, but I need not have been too concerned. I agree with Deputy Penrose that there is a need for a root and branch reform of the provision of health care.</P>
      <P>We are dealing specifically in this Bill with private health insurance cover. Health is the most important aspect of life for a large section of our population. Even when people are badly off financially, they say, &ldquo;Thank God, I have my health&rdquo;. Health is critical and good health is relative to age. It is taken for granted up to a certain age, but as we get older most of us pay more attention to our health and start to worry a little more about our health and health insurance cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are hypocritical in how we deal with the concept of health cover. In the distant past, people accepted that the State would not be able to afford to fund a total health service to care for all. People were encouraged and, in some cases, required to take out private health cover. The concept of private health cover was endorsed and has been promoted openly by all public representatives and major parties. I have not heard any Member argue against the concept of private health insurance cover. Successive Governments supported it and successive Ministers for Health have encouraged the idea of people contributing as much as possible for the provision of cover in the event of the need to avail of health services. The VHI was established and the Government encouraged other health insurance agencies to provide health cover. Assuming everyone supports the idea of paying in, the bottom line with the concept is, what do we pay out? That is where the difficulty arises. What do people get for their contributions? Like other Members, I would argue vehemently against any concept of a two-tier health service, but we need to decide what benefits we are prepared to give. Deputy Penrose described at length how people are getting privileges and facilities. That is a disgrace. Everyone should have equal access to the same service. However, if we are to argue that point with consistency, we should argue for an end to private insurance cover. We are getting muddled up in our approach to this area. There is great public confusion about the division between so-called public and private health care and the relationship between them. This debate may not allow for full clarification of all aspects of this matter, but, without adding to the confusion by going into <Col N="98" /> technicalities, issues such as the extension for those over 65 not getting involved in risk sharing and so on will add to that confusion.</P>
    <P>The rows between private health insurers and the consultants and hospitals regarding levels of care, the cost of care and so on have added to that confusion. There is a need to straighten out this issue once and for all. That will stop politicians from talking of jumping the queue. If people pay a lot of money for a service we should know exactly when and how they can get it in addition to what they are paying for it. However, we are looking at both sides of the coin almost constantly. We should debate this at some future date.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Bill, the key aspect has been to maintain the concept of community rating from day one to avoid cherry-picking, as has been said. To some people the VHI is in the wrong and does not want to compete on a level playing field, but I pay tribute to the VHI. It has a great record and has done a good job for the State since it was established. Competition will do VHI good. Although the organisation may feel it will suffer, competition will strengthen it.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned with community rating. Long before competition came in from abroad I had spoken to insurance people and others about community rating and some professionals assured me that if there was a voluntary mode involved there would be no difficulty and that the requirement was not necessary. I compare that situation with an earlier debate here regarding the difficulties young people have getting car insurance. We have seen how companies can blackguard people if there is no statutory requirement. The Minister and the Department involved are helpless in bringing those insurance companies into line. There is no legislation to do so and as a result people are being denied the civil right to put a car on the road and have it insured at a reasonable cost in order to go about their business. I am well aware of the risk factors associated with a certain age profile among males in particular, but these companies have gone too far. If there was no requirement for community rating among the private health insurers we would see similar difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Minister maintains the standard that has applied to the VHI from the start. Like others I am getting worried about some EU directives. Although they have opened up competition here, which is good, I am concerned that we might lose some benefits, particularly those enjoyed by older people and other vulnerable groups. Such groups had a measure of protection and I want to be sure they will continue to enjoy that protection when this Bill passes. I know such matters will be teased out later.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the confusion regarding the allocation of funds taken in from the private sec<Col N="99" /> tor and that is where I would carry out a root and branch examination, where the money is going, what elements are available and who does what. The common contract for consultants is being tampered with &ndash; that is the best way to put it. Changes are being put in place on an individual basis. Regarding the hiring of an individual consultant, the general common contract is there, but there was huge public confusion about that. If the public pays a consultant, should he or she be entitled to work in private practice? Under the Act they are, but it is related to the amount of work done. The argument in favour of the common contract was that we would not get the best talent to work for the State but that they would emigrate, though I do not know where they would go &ndash; they would not work for the poor people.</P>
    <P>Those days are gone and we should revisit this matter. If people want to work in the private or public sector they can choose. Very few people would have the privilege of overlapping. I have no radical proposals or suggestions, but there is confusion here regarding the management of this area, whether people should clock in and out and so on. It is a matter of historical fact that we have been afraid to challenge medical personnel, and the more senior they were the less one challenged them, perhaps because we thought they might be operating on us at some point. Those days are gone and now patients have rights and a charter. The public is paying and demands a service, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The issue of whether people are demanding a service because they are paying private health insurance or they are just contributing to the public kitty is one that will arise again. The range of services is improving radically and many people involved through health boards and advisory committees will have a knowledge of this area. It is difficult to explain to the public why waiting lists for orthopaedic services can expand so rapidly. When one examines the facts one can point out that nowadays several different types of operations are being carried out, whereas in the past it was just the hip operation. That can quadruple the waiting list.</P>
    <P>We need to identify the number of procedures for the public, and the way to do so is to count them, to see how long a procedure takes and how much it costs. Allowing for the difficulties from case to case, most procedures are very similar. With a little management we could carry out a far better evaluation of the care the public is getting. Every procedure can be measured. When I was chairman of the Southern Health Board we took a very crude approach to hip operations. We looked for the price that would be charged and we got prices from the three or four leading hospitals in the State. We then looked to the North and found that the charge was about 50% <Col N="100" /> to 60% of the charge in the Republic. We immediately shipped the few helicopter loads of patients up to Belfast where they were operated upon and they returned and everything went very well. It made people in the South think a little more about competition. We have not had to repeat that procedure since. We are now looking at transferring ENT cases. Whatever the procedure, we need to evaluate the output and my constituency colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, should not be afraid to measure what is happening. We all know how hard nursing staff and junior doctors work but we need to measure how all staff perform, be they management, consultants or others.</P>
    <P>There is a general improvement in the position in my locality. Cork University Hospital is located in Cork South-Central and a £110 million development programme is in place there for various services. Oncology received considerable media coverage during the week and a new service has been put in place in the hospital. Similar to what we found with the opening of the new offices last week, difficulties and impediments will arise when a new service is first provided. There is a saying in the engineering business that one cannot shoe a running horse. There will always be impediments while new facilities are being installed.</P>
    <P>However, it raises the question of an equal level of service throughout the country. I appreciate that there cannot be an acute hospital in every parish or village, but we should examine the level of service throughout the country. Just because the west has done badly in terms of oncology services does not automatically mean it is doing badly in terms of other services. We should look to the centres of excellence where they have tended to specialise and try to implement that standard throughout the country. It can be done. The best medical training has been provided and money is freely available to provide the best equipment and the centres exist. We should now be able to assure the people that their health needs are being catered for.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again my concern that the core principles of the health insurance system will be safeguarded despite competition. Only BUPA has entered the market so far to compete and it has about 160,000 customers. We were told that, when the market was opened up, there would be a flood of companies touting for business and offering different rates. Why has only one major company, BUPA, entered the market? Are there reasons for that other than the scattered population? Why is competition not being encouraged?</P>
    <P>I compliment the VHI on the job it did until the market was opened to competition. It served us well and I wish it and BUPA well in their future business.</P>

        <b>:</b> He referred to all the trouble that was caused and mentioned the 1980s. I will deal with a little history myself. I remember a good man, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, coming into office when inflation was at 21%. One cannot repeat that often enough to people in Fianna Fáil who think they have done a great job running the country. If we had inflation of 21% today, the country would be down the Swanee. Cuts were needed. The then Minister for Health and Children, Barry Desmond, had no money to spend nor did many good Fianna Fáil Ministers. If some of the current Ministers had to operate in such conditions, they might not do such a great job.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and am glad the VHI and BUPA can compete. I join with Deputy Dennehy in complimenting the VHI for the wonderful assistance it has given to so many people. I shared in that benefit last Christmas and during the summer, unfortunately, when another member of my family spent some time in hospital, the bills for all of which were paid by the VHI. One can say that we are fortunate to be in a position to pay the cost of VHI cover, but it does not question anything and just pays the bill and it should receive credit for that. BUPA can compete and, if it is able to provide a better service, so be it. It might not be easy if it covers the whole community, as it should, to provide figures for premia which will compete with the VHI.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the discussion on the VHI and BUPA, there is the other side of the medical service which has been discussed at length today, namely, the public health service. If I can paraphrase Shakespeare, I come to bury the public health service, not to praise it. One could not praise the public health service given the direction it is taking. The fact that I am in a position to pay for VHI cover does not make me feel that I should be treated in a superior way to those who suffer the same as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had an accident ten years ago and was referred by my GP to a specialist in Dublin. When nothing had happened after three weeks, I rang to know what was happening and was told that it would be six months before I could get an appointment. Having expressed amazement, the person on the other end of the line discovered I was a private patient and, after checking, asked if I was available the Friday of the following week. The pain I had was probably no more severe than that which thousands of others had who were on waiting lists. They had to wait six months whereas <Col N="102" /> I was fortunate enough to be seen in less than ten days. There is something wrong with that.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists at present are grossly unfair to people with serious illnesses. During the summer a person with a brain tumour was told it would be four months before he could be seen, even though he had suffered strokes at the time. He was treated but his family had to live with the thought of this person having to wait four months to be seen. I had to contact Beaumont Hospital yesterday because of another case and was told, which I accept, that, if they had more nursing staff, they could cater for many more because they must cater for the whole country. It is grossly unfair to people, especially family members watching, that patients are left waiting for months. One person contacted me this week looking to have an MRI scan. He can have one next March as a public patient but can have it next Wednesday as a private patient.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of staff and I know this because I visited a hospital daily this summer. Nurses are in short supply and it must be asked what is being done about it. For years they were treated with contempt as far as pay was concerned. They went on strike for the first time ever some 12 months ago and received what appeared to be a reasonable increase in percentage terms. However, given that they started on such a miserable salary, they are still grossly underpaid. For that reason, it is difficult to recruit nurses. I also discovered that the health services are employing a large number of agency nurses who are quite happy to pick the days on which they wish to work and the number of hours they work. These people can also avoid working at weekends. We must train more nurses, even if it takes three years to reach the stage where there will be an adequate supply. There is an urgent need to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I was concerned when I discovered that from next year the standard of admittance to nurse training will be based on the CAO standard. On many occasions I have stated that there will be a medical group in the country, namely, doctors, who will be highly intelligent but who will have no personal interest, perhaps, in medicine. At college, medicine is a status symbol. When parents ask why a certain young person did not take medicine on entering college, the answer they are given is that the individual in question did not want to take it even though they had reached the required points total.</P>
    <P>I have heard it stated that nursing has become a technical profession and that those who take it up must have a good knowledge of science subjects, etc. However, what a patient in hospital really needs is a kind person to care for them. If we go through the CAO and only accept those with top grades into the nursing profession, we will have taken the wrong road. I know a girl who repeated her leaving certificate this year because <Col N="103" /> since she was a child she has wanted to do nothing other than become a nurse. However, she was not successful in being accepted into nursing at college and she was devastated. The girl in question has an interest in people and in caring for those who are sick. Next year a person with nine A1 grades will want to become a nurse. She may be interested in science, experiments, etc., but will she be interested in people? I am not stating that a person who does well in the leaving certificate would not make a good nurse but I am afraid that we will go overboard and employ those with above average intelligence rather than those with an interest in the profession.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that any nurses who come to work here from abroad have a good bedside manner. There is nothing as bad as a gruff medical person, be it a consultant, a doctor or a nurse. A small measure of kindness goes a long way towards helping people feel better.</P>
    <P>With regard to other staff, I have long believed that speech therapists and physiotherapists are also badly treated. The salaries paid to these people are not nearly adequate when one considers the work they do. Speech therapists and physiotherapists are obliged to invest a great deal of effort into their work &ndash; they do not merely examine people, they must do a great deal of physical work. We are not paying these people enough and they are moving abroad as a result. Speech therapists, in particular, are badly needed to help young people with difficulties and old people who have suffered strokes. I understand they are travelling to Scotland where they can obtain twice the amount they are paid here.</P>
    <P>The issue of relativity as regards salaries is a major problem for health boards. At present, if one person receives an increase someone else must also receive it. None of my relations is involved in either speech therapy or physiotherapy but those who are employed in these professions should be rewarded for the difficult and important work they do.</P>
    <P>I suffered from a heart problem in the past and I was lucky to receive excellent advice from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, which led to my having an emergency operation in hospital. As a result, someone's name was pushed further down the waiting list. It is dreadful that people with heart problems are obliged to wait for their operation, year after year. The concerns of family members in this regard must also be considered.</P>

      <P>I have raised this issue on many occasions and outlined the urgent need to allow the building of this school to proceed. I previously raised this matter on the Adjournment on 14 October 1999 and 28 June 2000.</P>
      <P>In 1995, the gaelscoil was given priority status in the capital building budget for that year. It lost that status due to an unwillingness on the part of the Department to move the process forward. Full planning permission was granted in June 2000 and all requirements set out by the Department's planning and building unit in a letter dated 28 September 1999 have been fulfilled. There is no impediment to commencing the project and it is imperative that it should be immediately included for priority status in the capital building budget.</P>
      <P>Six of the eight classes in the school are housed in prefabricated buildings which are in contravention of the Factories Act, 1955, and the Building Control Act, 1990. Asbestos is visible in some of the prefabs and radon detectors have been installed by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. In one of the rooms the floor is split down the middle, water leaks into a number of classrooms and heating and sanitary requirements are completely inadequate for a school with more than 200 children and 11 teachers. Two toilet floors are in a state of collapse and some classes are taken in the community centre. Students have come to school and found their stationery and books missing and their desks covered with graffiti. The remedial room is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The gaelscoil pupils come from 36 parishes in west Limerick. Eight buses bring children from places up to 50 kilometres away each day. I have met some parents who have relocated from places as diverse as Singapore, Germany, the USA and England and who are proud to send their children to the gaelscoil. The school has been the recipient of many prestigious awards, not only from Ireland but also from Europe and, recently, the USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of these achievements were passed to the Taoiseach who recently visited the school. He saw the conditions which obtain at the school and agreed that action would be taken immediately. The urgent need for action will have to be communicated to the Department of Education and Science because it has displayed an obvious lack of urgency in respect of this matter. Symptomatic of this has been its lack of response to a letter sent by the gaelscoil on 8 November 1999. In this letter the gaelscoil requested the Department to refund £59,507.50 for the 2.5 acre site. There were also other associated costs which amounted to approximately £12,000. It is fortunate for the Department that, in light of escalating land values, the trustees of the school borrowed the <Col N="105" /> money to finance the purchase of the site from Shannon Development. I demand that the Department of Education and Science, as a matter of priority, refund the trustees in order to effect the transfer of the land to itself.</P>
    <P>The gaelscoil is situated quite close to the Ballygowan and the Nash mineral water factories, two local successful companies. Ballygowan alone has a minimum of 25 trucks with a gross weight of 38 tonnes each passing through the area every day. The nearness of these factories creates additional dangers for the children who attend this school.</P>
    <P>There has been great frustration during the past 15 years about the type of facilities in which the gaelscoil must operate. It is a tribute to the members of the teaching staff that they have been so successful in their achievements, despite difficult working conditions. The Taoiseach visited the school on Thursday, 5 October and promised to contact the Department of Education and Science. Following his visit, I have no doubt he gained a full appreciation of the urgent necessity for the building of a new school.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy based in Newcastle West, I will continue to fight for the right of parents, teachers and pupils to a proper educational environment. I will continue to fight for the right of the parents, teachers and pupils to a proper educational environment. It is important that action is taken to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The parents, teachers and pupils have been tolerant over the years. Their tolerance can no longer be taken for granted. It is imperative that approval is given to the building of a new gaelscoil. I hope the Minister's reply is strong on action because this is now a matter of urgency. I look forward to hearing it.</P>

      <P>The school's enrolment on 30 September 1999 was 217. At present the school is based in temporary accommodation in the local community centre and the Department of Education and Science is grant aiding 95% of the rental cost. However, in view of the fact that the obstacles in the way of purchasing the site for the new school have now been resolved the Department will make arrangements to advance the project to the point where tenders can be sought in the shortest time possible. I assure the Deputy that this case will be dealt with as speedily as possible, having regard to the large number of school building projects on hand within the Department.</P>

      <P>The word crisis is overused, not least in agriculture. However, it applies today to the poultry industry and in the words of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>on 2 September 2000, it is a sector in crisis. The root of this crisis was identified as long ago as December 1998 when the report of the food industry development group stated that &ldquo;good growth in consumption and production is being matched by increased competition from imports&rdquo; and that &ldquo;domestic processors are slipping in their bid to compete for the high value added segment of the market&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of that report the situation has deteriorated. Consumption has increased markedly but so have imports of chicken meat. We now have the alarming situation where imports now account for 37% of domestic consumption. More alarming still is the lack of proper monitoring and quality control of these imports. The consumer is in the dark. Chicken meat and other poultry products are being sold in a processed state with no indication of country of origin. The vast majority of consumers are totally unaware of this. In many cases the imported product is packaged by Irish processors and consumers assume from the familiar label that they are eating Irish produced poultry. However, as the figures show they are increasingly likely to be eating products imported from other countries both inside and outside the EU. There is grave concern at the lack of quality control, particularly for products sourced outside the EU. A growing proportion of imports are from the far east. Consumers must be assured both of a clear choice between Irish and imported products and a cast iron guarantee of the safety of all food.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister and his Department, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority, to introduce quality controls and regulations, including country of origin labelling on all poultry products, given the growing concern at the ever increasing level of unrestricted chicken meat imports that are not subject to the high standards and controls that apply to the home grown product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in the poultry industry now threatens the livelihood of nearly 400 growers and breeders and their families, many of them in my own constituency. The growers are caught in an unequal commercial relationship with the poultry processors. They depend totally on them both for meal and day old chickens with which they are supplied by the processors. The growers point out that there is no semblance of partnership in the industry and they, with consumers, are the losers. Unless there is concerted action at the highest <Col N="107" /> level the consumers, producers and ultimately the processors will all lose out.</P>
    <P>The promise of planned development of this industry has not been fulfilled. The market for value added poultry has been taken over by imports with consequent loss to this economy. The Irish Poultry Producers Association claims there are many independent importers operating who have no grower base at all in this country. This points to the urgent need for proper regulation of all products, home grown and imported, and regulation of the commercial relationships within the industry so that the livelihoods of all can be protected and the industry developed on a basis of real partnership.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the poultry industry has come to a head in County Monaghan. Producers staged a sit-in for over a week at the premises of Monaghan Poultry Products. I have already urged the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to intervene directly. There is a great need for all involved in the poultry industry to recognise the interdependence of producer and processor. Many hundreds of jobs depend on it. Nothing but disaster can result from outright obstinacy from whatever interest.</P>
    <P>I appeal for talks to commence and to continue in a constructive vein until a firm resolution is achieved. I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to prioritise this sector in crisis and to restore the vision and reality of a vibrant and expanding Irish poultry industry supplying safe quality products for consumers at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and I assure the Deputy that the points he has raised will be conveyed to the Minister. I have listened to what the Deputy has said and I hope he will give consideration to the reply.</P>
      <P>Poultry imports are estimated to account for a third of total poultry consumption in Ireland. These imports come mainly from other European Union countries such as the UK and the Netherlands and to a lesser extent from countries outside the EU such as Brazil and Thailand. Quality and health controls apply to both sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poultrymeat imports from the EU are subject to the same hygiene standards which are set out in a series of directives and regulations. These cover such matters as <i>ante mortem </i>inspection of the live birds, criteria for approval of production establishments and supervision of slaughtering and processing operations. All premises at which poultry is slaughtered must have the extensive facilities and control systems specified in legislation before they can place product on the market. As well as national controls the EU Commission takes an active interest in the standards <Col N="108" /> and procedures in place in member states and conducts audits and inspections for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed at the growth in imports from countries outside the EU. The fact is that the European Union exports over three times the amount of poultrymeat it imports and this trend is expected to continue. Therefore, the relatively liberal trading regime in this sector is more beneficial than harmful to the Union. Under the World Trade Organisation's GATT arrangements the EU is obliged to improve import access for third country products and there are also trade agreements in place with eastern European countries whereby products can move in both directions at significantly reduced rates of duty.</P>
    <P>There is an extensive control regime in place in regard to the veterinary and public health aspects of poultrymeat imported into the EU from third countries. This includes approval of the country or origin as regards disease situation and reliability of official veterinary services. The slaughterhouses supplying poultrymeat must be approved by the EU Commission and experts from the EU travel to third countries to inspect these premises from time to time. Advance notification of all imports must be given to the veterinary authorities of the first EU country at which the poultrymeat will arrive. The product must be presented at a designated border inspection post where it will be subjected to the necessary identity, physical and documentary checks by authorised veterinarians. Thereafter entry into free circulation in the EU will be permitted only when all requirements are met. While the growth in imports of poultry meat is of concern from an economic point of view, I have no evidence that imported poultry meat is of poor quality, nor is there evidence that imported product is not subject to the standards and controls applicable to the Irish product. Imported product is subject to the same testing and analysis which is carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and by the FSAI on domestic poultry.</P>
    <P>As regards labelling, this area is primarily the responsibility of the Office of Consumer Affairs. Poultry imported from other EU countries and Irish product must bear a health mark indicating, in an abbreviated form, the country and premises where it was produced. This identity can be lost when the poultry is further processed or incorporated into other foods. I understand that a considerable quantity of imported product goes to the catering trade, in which case origin labelling would not reach the consumer.</P>
    <P>There is a need for rationalisation and development within the poultry sector. This has been accepted in the Government's response to the report by the AgriFood 2010 Committee. While primary responsibility for investment in the sector and rationalisation of its processing structures lies <Col N="109" /> with the industry, measures under the national plan will be available to encourage such investment.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important subject regarding the citizens of Sligo. There has been a question mark in recent times over the future of the borough of Sligo and it is important that it should be clarified at the earliest possible date. Certain people have tried to make a major political issue out of it by inferring that it is proposed to downgrade the status of Sligo borough. This is not the position, but it is imperative that a clear signal is given to the members and staff of Sligo Borough Council.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the tremendous work being done by the local authority in Sligo town and the work done over the years. Its functions, such as striking a rate and dealing with all its own internal problems, must be retained. The position of uncertainty has led to people within the corporation becoming concerned and feeling that they are left in a position where they do not know what the future will hold. The possibility of expansion rather than the reduction in the powers of Sligo Borough Council is the most important matter. I make this point because Sligo is one of the fastest developing areas in the north-west and has been cited in numerous reports as an area for major expansion.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister, on behalf of his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will clarify this matter and put the citizens of Sligo at ease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like my colleague, Deputy Ellis, would to like to raise the important matter of the status of Sligo Borough. Sligo was granted borough status in 1609 by King James I and it is one of the oldest borough councils in the country. It is also one of the most historic. Sligo is the capital of the north-west and is identified in the Fitzpatrick report as a major regional growth centre. Sligo is the hub of the north-west, a growing and prosperous borough with an increased population and a geographic location which puts it in the centre of the BMW region.</P>
      <P>Sligo is also the business hub of the north-west region. Offices for the region for banking, insurance, the IDA, etc. are located in Sligo. As the only borough within the BMW region, it would be a shame if the proposed downgrading to Sligo borough went ahead. Sligo is the home to the institute of technology, with almost 4,000 students. It is recognised as providing the leading education facility of the north-west. Sligo town is also a major shopping centre of the north-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> The people of the north-west, particularly Sligo, do not want to see the downgrading of Sligo borough. We in Sligo want the borough council retained with the same powers as before, including those, as my colleague, Deputy John Ellis, said, relating to the striking of rates etc. There is a groundswell of opinion in favour of maintaining the Sligo borough status, which most politicians in particular acknowledge. I, like my colleague, want to see that status maintained. I would like the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make sure that Sligo is not downgraded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House this evening, I am delighted to respond to this matter on his behalf, and I thank Deputies Ellis and Brennan for raising it.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Local Government Bill, 2000, was published before the summer recess and will be considered by this House in the coming weeks. The Bill seeks to consolidate and modernise local government law, introduces a range of reforms and generally underpins the programme of local government renewal which is well under way. Following from last year's referendum, Bunreacht na hÉireann recognises local government as part of our democratic system and guarantees local elections. Article 28A of our constitution provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that there shall be such directly elected local authorities as may be determined by law.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Bill, 2000, follows directly from this provision. It places our local authorities within a modern statutory framework repealing 19th century UK statutes on which the system is currently based. By way of comparison, our neighbours in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland are now governed by their own separate modern local government code. In our local government law, Sligo is currently described as a borough under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act, 1840. The Local Government Bill, 2000, seeks, <i>inter alia</i>, to replace 19th century terminology with modern language of relevance to Irish society in the 21st century. To reflect this, the 19th century statutory reference to &ldquo;borough&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;town&rdquo;, as was proposed by the previous Government in its White Paper, Better Local Government. This was recommended also in the Barrington report of 1990 and by the commission on local government in 1996.</P>
      <P>The Minister would like to reassure everyone that what is involved here is simply an updating of terminology in local government law. It does not affect the reality of Sligo's position as a major regional centre. Under the Bill, the office of Mayor will continue and the borough council membership will remain at 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In updating 19th century law, it is not the intention to turn our backs on the past but to recognise centuries of civic history and tradition. To this <Col N="111" /> end the Local Government Bill, 2000, contains specific recognition of the original royal charters from which the boroughs draw their historic roots. I am aware of the concerns which have been expressed by the boroughs and the mayors and the perception that in some way they are being downgraded. The Minister has listened to the genuinely expressed concerns of local people and their public representatives. Local customs and traditions and a sense of identity and affinity with the places where we were born and reared are important to us all. That is why the Minister gave an undertaking to look again at the position as it affects the borough local authorities to allay concerns with regard to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is currently engaged in a consultation process through the local authority representative associations and is confident the conclusion of this process can lead to a satisfactory outcome. This Bill, when enacted, will allow us all to move forward together in building a better local government system that will support and enhance the growth and development of our country.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone doubt our commitment to the development of Sligo, it forms part of the BMW region for which the Government secured full Structural Fund support up to 2006. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will, through the major investment programmes set out in the national development plan, support the provision of improved water supply and waste water treatment systems with projects like the Sligo environs water supply scheme and Sligo main drainage scheme at a total cost of more than £45 million. A major programme of improvements on national roads serving the Sligo area is being supported, including the Sligo inner relief road and the N14, N15, N16, N17 and N59, and there is a substantial increase in funding for non-national roads. Such major investment will provide the foundation for continued economic and social development in Sligo and surrounding areas and is a vote of confidence for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a commitment to the representative associations to meet them again to discuss various aspects of the Bill, and he will do so shortly. The Bill will be a better one as a result of this dialogue.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House. A few weeks ago the nation was intensely proud of Sonia O'Sullivan and her magnificent achievement in winning the silver medal in the 5000 metres in Sydney. In the aftermath of this magnificent Sydney performance, we had the unedifying dispute between the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and Mr. Pat Hickey of the IOC, with attempts to apportion blame for a perceived lack of achievement by the rest of the Irish team. The Minister deserved a gold medal for brass neck and hypocrisy because the reality is that in three <Col N="112" /> and a half years he has failed to put in place the capital, organisational and coaching resources necessary to enable young Irish athletes give of their best and develop their full potential. Outstanding young Irish athletes are still receiving minimal or no support from the Government.</P>
      <P>A striking case in point is the history of Glin Boxing Club in Bonnybrook Parish, Coolock which is in the northside partnership area and is one of the most disadvantaged districts in Ireland. It is a very distinguished boxing club and over 25 years has produced many Irish champions, all-Ireland winners, international boxers and successful competitors in European and World championships under its two outstanding trainers, Tommy Thompson and Shay O'Hare. Usually there are up to 50 youths involved in training and competing.</P>
      <P>About two years ago the home ring and gym of Glin Boxing Club was burned when there was a fire at the local Bonnybrook scout troop centre on Bunratty Drive. The club mentors, led by Mr. O'Hare, with strong support from me, tried every available avenue to procure a new gym in Coolock, so far, without success. For one reason, many of the local public venues are chock-a-block with the huge number of voluntary and community bodies in the Coolock area and their associated activities. On at least two occasions, in 1999 and 2000, I have drawn the attention of the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and that of my local colleague, the Minister, Deputy Woods, to this appalling situation but have received neither encouragement nor help. The club could not chase the local sports capital grants last year because it had no home and no address.</P>
      <P>The upshot of this disgraceful situation is that for nearly two years a dedicated group of young athletes has been left to train on the streets and in a garden shed belonging to one of the parents. Amazingly, these boxers include the brilliant young Irish international and world junior bronze medallist at fly weight, Darren Campbell of Bonnybrook, who is a product of the great training system run at Glin by Tommy Thompson and Shay O'Hare.</P>
      <P>The core of my criticism of the Minister's comments in Sydney is the extraordinary situation where young Darren Campbell was preparing for an Irish international bout against the US in America by effectively training in his father's garden shed and without any proper gym or sporting facilities. The Minister cannot at this stage be taken seriously in relation to the development of local and international sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister published the report of his Department for 1999 and I note he stresses in his strategic aim that participation in sport and recreation, particularly by disadvantaged communities, is one of his core aims. Yet under the sports capital programme in 1999 he only spent £14.4 million on 416 projects out of nearly 2,000 submissions. It was far too little given the number of clubs throughout Ireland, such as the Glin Boxing Club, which have no facilities and which <Col N="113" /> are in a disgraceful situation. One could spend at least £1 million in each of the 42 Dáil constituencies &ndash; Carlow-Kilkenny would be no different &ndash; for the next five or six years to try to get our facilities up to scratch if the Minister is serious about putting forward a very strong Irish team in Athens in 2004.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister started the international carding scheme, with £1.1 million being allocated last year, and I understand Darren Campbell was a beneficiary. It seems, however, the Minister is not devoting the kind of resources necessary, not just at local level. Distinguished international sport begins at local level and we must be prepared to put in resources locally. As I previously asked the Minister and the Taoiseach, what is the point in creating an elite campus costing £500 million at Abbotstown on the M50 if we still have athletes, such as the Glin boxers, training on the streets or in this case in a garden shed?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to match his fine words with action to resolve the outrageous situation of the young boxers in Coolock. Over the past two decades Glin Boxing Club has provided recreational and fitness training for more than 40 young boys and men from Bonnybrook parish in Coolock each week. It is now crucial that the Minister, Deputy McDaid, ends the pointless blather that occurred in Sydney, and takes urgent steps to provide local sports bodies such as Glin Boxing Club with permanent, dedicated gym and training facilities. Is it any wonder only one of our boxers made it to Sydney?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy up on a number of points. I agree with him in congratulating Sonia O'Sullivan on her magnificent achievement, but if the Deputy takes careful cognisance of what I said in Sydney he will know that I will work with anyone for the betterment of Irish sport, but I will certainly not turn a blind eye to what I witnessed happening in Sydney.</P>
      <P>Regarding the one boxer who qualified this year, boxing is now an exceptionally difficult area in which to qualify for the Olympics simply because the International Boxing Federation has introduced a new system whereby a boxer must compete in four competitions in order to qualify. It is recognised as an advancement in that area and it is becoming more difficult to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the carding scheme, I introduced it for the first time into the country. It was not introduced as a result of Administrations which included the Deputy's party. This year the scheme provided £1.162 million directly to athletes to enable them carry on with training and using the necessary facilities. The carding scheme is on a par with other such schemes. Only the UK scheme compares to it and we are ahead of other countries in Europe, while the schemes in Australia, New Zealand and Canada do not compare at all to our scheme. It is like everything else in terms of starting something and assisting in its development. I hope the carding scheme will be <Col N="114" /> continued in the future and that it has sown the seeds of assistance for many athletes.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's views that the energy and dedication of voluntary people should be supported in the provision of a range of appropriate sports and recreational facilities around the country. I also acknowledge the contribution which the sport of boxing makes to the character formation of many young people. With this in mind under the Department's sports capital programme, I allocated £35 million to voluntary and community organisations and to local authorities to help them in upgrading, improving, equipping and providing new facilities. This compares with an allocation of £14.6 million last year. This year, under my Department's sports capital programme, I have allocated £36 million to voluntary and community organisations and local authorities to assist them in upgrading, improving, equipping or providing new facilities. In 1997, a sum of £7 million was provided whereas a total of £51 million has been allocated this year. This is by far the largest ever Government allocation for sports and recreational facilities and brings the total allocations made under the programme to £56 million in my two years in office. During those two years, 1,100 projects have been supported and I am waiting for up to 1,700 projects which have already been grant aided to draw down funding. This funding will assist the clubs and groups concerned to develop much needed sports and recreational facilities and will have a major impact on the social, youth and sports aspect of the community involved. It will also provide a high quality, well designed and sustainable infrastructure for sport and recreation. The type of projects being funded under the sports capital programme include multi-purpose sports facilities, community halls, pitches, facilities for individual sports, dressing rooms, etc., in addition to smaller allocations towards the provisions of sports and athletic equipment.</P>
    <P>While much remains to be done in regard to the provision of sport and recreational facilities, it is fair to say that we have made a great start in many areas. I am informed that while the organisation in question applied for an equipment grant under the sports capital programme, it did not apply for a grant towards a building. I am awaiting the resolution of an issue between the Irish Sports Council and the Amateur Boxing Association of Ireland concerning a drugs related matter before announcing any allocations for boxing clubs this year. I hope the issue will be resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I intend to publicly advertise the 2001 sports capital programme before the end of this year and the club will then have an opportunity to complete the relevant application. Perhaps it could do so in conjunction with the Deputy. Many of the people involved in these organisations work on a voluntary basis and do not realise that one cannot fill in a form in a slipshod manner; that is not acceptable in view of the level of Exchequer funding which is allocated. The <Col N="115" /> people in the Irish Sports Council would be very happy to assist the Deputy and the club concerned in this regard. The completed form should be forwarded to the Department where it will be assessed for funding under next year's programme in accordance with the criteria and conditions laid down.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that boxing clubs have made a valuable contribution, particularly in dis<Col N="116" /> advantaged areas. The volunteers concerned put their money where their mouths are and become involved in their communities. I receive many GAA and soccer applications but the level of boxing applications has not been satisfactory. It is an area which I would like to assist to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 17 October 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that I launched the new social economy programme on 18 September 2000. The programme arose from the Government decision in July 1999 on foot of the recommendations of the Partnership 2000 working group's report on the social economy. Following that decision a national monitoring committee representative of relevant Departments and the social partners was established.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee agreed the &ldquo;Framework&rdquo; for the operation of the new programme including the eligibility criteria and the local operating structures. Details on the social economy programme and the &ldquo;Framework&rdquo; are available on the Departments website at www.entemp.ie.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the social economy programme are to promote the emergence and consolidation of the social economy; to maximise the potential of the social economy to generate employment that is sustainable and of high quality, subject to labour market constraints; to regenerate both urban and rural communities by providing urgently needed local services, employment opportunities and experience for people who have been distanced from the labour market; and to promote equal opportunities between men and women.</P>
      <P>The programme will be particularly targeted at disadvantaged communities and long-term unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>Three categories of project will be funded under the social economy programme; community businesses, which are ultimately expected to be financed from trading income alone; deficient-demand social enterprises, where the demand for particular goods and services within a community is not matched by resources to pay for these due to disadvantage or low density of population; and enterprises based on public service contracts, where public services in disadvantaged areas and communities are subcontracted to local social economy enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> When fully operational, the programme will provide for an annual expenditure of £41 million per annum. A total of £213 million has been provided in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The objective is to create employment for 2,500 by the end of 2003. The programme will be phased in over the coming years through the reallocation of funding from community employment and from the remodelling of the FÁS community enterprise programme.</P>
    <P>Preparations are well advanced for the commencement of projects.</P>
    <P>The programme will be operated by FÁS. Local working groups have been set up by FÁS to ensure the principle of partnership between statutory bodies, the social partners and local community and voluntary interests and to oversee the operation of the social economy programme at local level, including identifying and prioritising areas of social economy activity. Working groups will advise and make recommendations to FÁS on specific funding applications under the social economy programme.</P>
    <P>Social economy enterprises will receive grant aid supports for up to a period of three years. These grants will include supports for employees, a manager, accountancy, training, capital and overheads.</P>

      <P>I asked the Competition and Mergers Review Group to advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. The recommendations referred to the review group concern: the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers; an amendment to merger law to enable consideration to be given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares; and the consideration of the issue of concentration of ownership on a media-wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>
      <P>I published the report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on 4 May 2000. The group, which was chaired by Mr. Michael Collins SC, made some 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law and the administration of mergers law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two of the 40 recommendations relate to newspapers and media and arise from the recommend<Col N="119" /> ations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which reported in June 1996. The review group has recommended legislative changes so as to require the Minister, when considering a merger in the media sector, to consider certain criteria identified by the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.</P>
    <P>The other recommendation relates to the issue of the acquisition of undertakings by means other than the acquisition of shares. The Competition and Mergers Review Group have recommended that the &ldquo;control test&rdquo; in the EU merger regulation be incorporated into Irish merger law.</P>
    <P>I am positively disposed to the implementation of the recommendations in this matter and will be bringing proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>There has been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of insurance premiums in the area of public liability. This examination has focussed on a number of the key cost elements, including the levels of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. Concurrent with this examination, efforts are being made to identify measures, which both individually and cumulatively could have a moderating effect on public liability insurance costs.</P>
      <P>The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche Report on the Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs found that the main contributory factors to rising premium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements, the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards, relative to special damages in smaller claims.</P>
      <P>Following consideration by Government of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, a special working group was set up to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>I am currently in the process of examining the recommendations contained in the special working group's second and final report on a personal injuries tribunal.</P>
      <P>Apart from Government initiatives, greater attention to safety in the workplace can further reduce insurance costs. Accordingly, I launched the voluntary code of practice, adopted by the initiative on workplace safety group, a group representing the key players in the area of accident prevention and claims mitigation.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme provides work experience for long-term unemployed persons for a period of one to three years. CE participants in schools projects are employed as secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants.</P>
      <P>My Department, in the context of the commitment under section 4.2.4 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is engaged in on-going discussions with the Department of Education and Science with a view to determining how to transfer all or part of the funding currently spent on CE schemes in schools to that Department. This would provide an increase in funding for schools over and above the additional resources already allocated by the Department of Education and Science for these purposes over the past year.</P>
      <P>The precise nature of the scheme to be implemented is at present under consideration in the Department of Education and Science, having regard to the needs of the different elements of the schools sector. While there may be some short-term reduction in funding for schools due to the CE restructuring and the need for FÁS to prioritise projects, the proposals under consideration in the Department of Education and Science would result in increased annual funding for schools on a more permanent basis than that which has been provided up to now through CE.</P>
      <P>I would hope to have proposals ready for consideration by the social partners through the PPF standing committee on the labour market later this month. The consultation process should be completed and proposals agreed and set in train by the year end.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 26, 33, 38, 52, 67, 74, 77 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Drug testing of employees and potential candidates seeking employment is not a feature of the Irish labour market. It is, I understand, a more common practice in the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that drug screening has no legal basis and cannot be carried out without a person's consent as, under our Constitution, it may be an infringement of human rights in relation to privacy and bodily integrity to do so. Even if it were a condition of a contract of employment that <Col N="123" /> employees or potential employees were required to undergo drug screening, the prior consent of the employee would be required.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the retention of records by employers or disclosure of information to other potential employers would be in contravention of the Data Protection Act, 1988, which requires that all information held by employers should be relevant to the position held by the employee. In addition, there would also be breaches of the Freedom of Information Act, 1998, in relation to public servants if records relating to them were transferred to another employer.</P>
    <P>Requiring some employees and not others to undergo drug screening would also be discriminatory under the Equality Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House that there has not been any discussion between my Department and the Department of Health and Children in relation to drug screening of employees or potential employees.</P>
    <P>Finally, because of the complexity of the issue, I have no proposals to introduce legislation to regulate drug testing of employees. I should say that any employee, whose employer is attempting to implement drug screening procedures, should refer the matter to the employment rights section of my Department. I would ask members of this House to provide me with any information they may have of any such cases, so that my labour inspectorate can check out the situation on the ground.</P>

      <Quest> if her Department has undertaken or plans any study to determine the reasons for the record loss of 22,000 State funded jobs during 1999 identified in the recent Forfás report; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Job losses, whenever and wherever they occur, are of major concern to my Department and the agencies which report to it and are closely examined by those bodies as such losses can be tragic and traumatic for the individuals concerned. However, it is necessary to look at these losses in the context of the overall number of jobs created in agency assisted firms.</P>
      <P>During 1999 there were approximately 34,600 job gains in agency assisted firms, which offset the job losses in similar firms of approximately 21,600 giving a net gain of approximately 13,000 during the year, bringing permanent full-time employment in the agency assisted company. Indeed, the figure for job gains was the highest achieved in the 1990s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Analysis of the job losses shows that they reflect the gradual re-orientation of industry towards higher value added sectors and restruc<Col N="124" /> turing in the indigenous and foreign owned industrial base in response to intense competition in both domestic and export markets. It also shows that, as a percentage of the employment base, the figure for 1999 is not far out of line with the normal pattern reaching 7.8% as opposed to the normal level of about 7%. A certain level of &ldquo;job churn&rdquo; is always to be expected in the economy and is not necessarily a bad thing, particularly if it leads to a shift in employment into higher productivity sectors thereby maintaining competitiveness.</P>
    <P>For the most part, the job losses which occurred in 1999 took place in the more traditional industries, particularly consumer products, clothing and textiles. This is symptomatic of the restructuring that is taking place in industry where lower paid jobs are being replaced by higher value adding employment in higher technology areas.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the changing global environment in which industry operates and in an effort to ensure that Irish industry remains competitive, the focus of industrial policy has shifted away from simple job creation towards raising the quality of companies and strengthening their sustainability and strategic value while ensuring that Irish firms participate fully in and benefit from the new era of e-business. Support is being focussed strongly on companies with potential for significant growth to ensure that they develop the capability across the range of business functions to sustain competitiveness and grow.</P>
    <P>Increased output and employment now depends ever more on productivity growth. The enhancement of human resource capabilities is of strategic importance in the development and maintenance of national competitiveness and investment in training will help firms to achieve this. This will in turn help raise living standards and further enhance competitiveness turning Ireland into a high income, high productivity, high value added economy based on world class skills, technology and production systems.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which was published in June 1996, made a number of recommendations which concerned the functional responsibilities of a number of Departments. In November 1996 the then Minister presented an <i>aide-memoire</i> to Government on the recommend<Col N="125" /> ations contained in the report. The Government decided that each Minister upon whose area of responsibility the recommendations impacted should revert to Government on to any necessary action. One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry was that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The commission was clear that this ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>I support the recommendation regarding the establishment of an ombudsman and I also agree that it is for the newspaper industry to regulate itself in this regard.</P>
      <P>The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation and in that respect I understand from my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department.</P>

      <P>In my reply to Question No. 35 from Deputy Rabbitte, I conveyed the information received from the Director of Consumer Affairs concerning progress on enforcement to date of one of the consumer protection measures, the order in relation to the freezing of drink prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, therefore, propose to confine my reply to the Deputy to progress on the other consumer protection measure, the prices awareness campaign. The Director of Consumer Affairs has to date taken two initiatives in this regard. The first related to petrol, with the survey of fuel prices which was carried out by her office in the period 31 July to 3 August last. While this survey was limited in scope, it did enable the director to draw a number of conclusions, in particular that there was potential for significant savings in motoring costs. In a press release on 13 August, she drew attention to the significant differences and urged motorists to note the prices charged by filling stations and to frequent those which charged lower prices. The director plans to carry out a further petrol survey in November. The second initiative related to a survey which the director commissioned the Consumers' Association of Ireland to carry out in relation to the prices of 30 popular products in major supermarkets and other stores. The first survey was carried out in September and showed that in relation to the major supermarkets, there was very little price difference. The director plans to have three <Col N="126" /> further surveys carried out up to, and including, December with attendant publicity.</P>

A total of 453 working visas and 141 work authorisations issued for this period up until the end of September 2000.</P>
      <P>I noted with interest comments made recently by IBEC in relation to the new fastrack scheme. I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the State has been advertising the existence of the scheme through the FÁS jobs fairs and that it was given very considerable publicity at its inception. It is my Department's experience that employment agencies are well aware of the existence of the new arrangements and details are available on my Department's website and the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I trust that, as a representative organisation, IBEC has informed its own members of the details of the scheme.</P>
      <P>IBEC is a member of the immigration policy advisory committee, established by the Government to provide an input into evolving immigration policy from a labour market perspective. I am confident that IBEC will use that forum to make a very constructive input in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 34 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, was the subject of one of 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law, including the groceries order, and the administration of mergers law in the final report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group which I published in May last.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the groceries order, the majority of the review group recommended that the groceries order be repealed; any legislation or regulation introduced in relation to the grocery trade should not include a ban on below cost selling; and some form of regulation be introduced in relation to the grocery trade which would in particular require suppliers to publish the terms on which they are prepared to trade with retailers, would require retailers to honour the credit terms on which suppliers are prepared to trade with them, would ban &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, and would require retailers not to discriminate between classes of customers in respect of the products which they sell. I am considering this recommendation and I will make a decision on it as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Both myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, have had a wide range of representations from people who have an interest and strongly held views on this matter. We have met any interests which have requested a meeting.</P>
      <P>In so far as future investment decisions are concerned, there has been expansion and upgrading of facilities by those traditionally operating in the market and there has also been investment from abroad providing the Irish consumer with greater choice. As competition in the market is about value for money and choice I welcome these developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, came into force on 1 April 2000 providing for, with cer<Col N="128" /> tain limited exceptions, a minimum hourly average rate of pay of £4.40. Introduction of the Act was accompanied by an intensive nationwide advertising campaign embracing television, radio and print media. Helpline services were strengthened to assist inquirers in clarifying issues of concern and a detailed explanatory booklet together with a summary leaflet were distributed widely.</P>
      <P>The legislation is enforced in the workplace by the labour inspectorate of my Department. There are 17 inspectors in the inspectorate, seven of whom were appointed last April by way of additional resources, authorised by Government decision of December 1999, to assist in NMW enforcement work. All 17 inspectors, as part of their general employment rights legislation enforcement work, check on the compliance of employers with their responsibilities under the National Minimum Wage Act.</P>
      <P>From the commencement date of the Act to 30 September 2000 a total of 2,531 compliance inspections have been carried out by the inspectorate. These revealed infringements in the case of 193 employers which, in some cases, might involve several employees. The majority of infringements have tended to be of a rather minor nature and to be more the result of misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the provisions of the Act than of deliberate intention to defraud. Infringements found are normally rectified through the intervention of the visiting inspectors and, to date, the need for legal prosecution has not arisen.</P>
      <P>Other than one particular case in which, in correspondence with my Department, an employer indicated that he had let go 30 staff owing to his inability to pay them the NMW, I am not aware of any redundancies arising specifically as a result of the operation of the NMW. In the period 1 April to 30 September 2000 the number of redundancies notified to my Department was 5,775. It is not possible to say if any of these are NMW-related.</P>
      <P>The monitoring group established by the Tánaiste to monitor and assess the implementation of the NMW Act has commenced its work which will continue over the coming months. The group will be assisted in its work by the results of a follow-up survey to be undertaken by the ESRI later this year of the firm survey it carried out in late 1998-early 1999. The results of that initial firm survey formed part of the study, undertaken by the ESRI, of the likely impact of the introduction of the NMW.</P>

      <P>The nominal duration of apprenticeship is four years. With the exception of those who fail or refuse to attend training, the majority of apprentices complete their training within this period. In this case, therefore, the issue of delays in the completion of training is not significant.</P>
      <P>Issues have arisen, however, in regard to the timeliness of provision of off the job training at phases two, four and six of the seven phase standards based apprenticeship system. The quantification of those delays is extremely complex and is affected by the date on which an apprentice was registered with FÁS, the number of apprentices looking for off the job training in any designated trade at a particular time, the geographical location in which the apprentice is employed and in which the training is provided, the attendance of apprentices and the releasing of apprentices by their employers and finally by the availability of training capacity for the trade.</P>
      <P>In the latter regard, concerted efforts are under way to reduce waiting times. All apprentices are being offered a phase 2 training place within the first year of their apprenticeship. The number of apprentices currently eligible to attend for phase 4 and 6 training stands at 2,830, all of whom will be offered training by January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS has introduced a number of measures designed to provide all apprentices with more timely off the job training. The number of training places for phase 2 has been increased from 3,300 places annually as at September 1996 to a <Col N="130" /> current provision of 7,060 places. The Department of Education and Science has increased the number of phase 4 and 6 training places from 4,100 places annually as at September 1996 to a current provision of 9,500 places. The institutes of technology provided an additional 750 phase 4 and 6 training places during summer 2000. FÁS has also contracted for the provision of 660 phase 4 electrician training places in the ESB. FÁS has also introduced a number of administrative changes to working procedures that have significantly improved attendance at training. These changes have resulted in an effective further increase in training capacity.</P>
    <P>In the context of its overall responsibility for the operation of the apprenticeship system, I have asked the director general of FÁS to arrange a briefing for the Deputy on these issues raised in her question.</P>

      <P>Directive 96/82/EC, also known as Seveso II, concerns the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances.</P>
      <P>Ireland was one of six EU member states &ndash; Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria and Belgium &ndash; against whom the EU Commission recently announced its intention to initiate legal action for its failure to transpose Directive 96/82/EC (Seveso II). Devising the proposed regulations European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2000 has been extremely complex and involved the co-ordination across a number of concerned Departments and agencies.

It contains some 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation including enforcement of competition law; the administration of mergers law; the operation and procedures of the Competition Authority; the newspaper industry; the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987; and legislative consolidation.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with workplace health and safety. Under the 1989 Act, the Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the 1989 Act apply to all employers, including the self-employed, and cover all places of work. Under section 12 of the Act every employer must prepare a safety statement. The concept of a safety statement is as applicable to a farm as it is to any other place of work.</P>
      <P>To assist farmers to achieve greater compliance with this legal requirement, the authority has undertaken to produce guidelines for the preparation of safety statements specifically for the farming sector. The authority is committed to having these guidelines issued and circulated to the sector by 1 March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure the guidelines will be of assistance to all farmers the authority is at present carrying out a pilot programme in 12 locations throughout the country in which a draft safety statement format is being completed by approximately ten <Col N="132" /> farmers at each location. The feedback will be analysed and a workable format will then be produced. This exercise is being funded by the EU as part of the EU campaign in agriculture 2000. Support for this programme has been forthcoming from all the main farming organisations who are also represented on the authority's agriculture safety task force.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who enforces the order on the freezing of drink prices, that her inspectorate has been involved in a series of visits to licensed premises to ensure compliance. A total of 883 premises have been visited and 217 of these have been visited a second time. In initial visits, the general position apparently was that premises were not in a position to provide evidence of compliance with the order. However, I understand from the director that, as time goes on, this evidence has been more forthcoming.</P>
      <P>To date, the director has initiated proceedings in one case, where there have been breaches of the order, and this is scheduled to come before the Dublin District Court on 8 December. The director is considering the legal position in the other cases.</P>
      <P>In addition, prosecutions are under way concerning breaches of the order in relation to the display of drink prices, in respect of those cases where the price charged exceeded the price displayed, and which were discovered in the course of the inspection process on the price freeze.</P>
      <P>The ODCA inspectors will of course continue to enforce the drink prices freeze, and the director and I share the view that special vigilance will be required in the run up to Christmas and the New Year.</P>

      <P>The economic boom in Ireland means that there are plenty of employment opportunities available for all who are in a position to avail of them. Labour shortages mean employers have to look at all available sources to meet their needs. The importance of older people in the workforce will grow in coming years with the population under 25 set to fall while the numbers in the older age groups are forecast to rise.</P>
      <P>Given these trends we have to look at ways of encouraging older people, embracing retired persons and women in the home, who wish to do so, to return to the work force, as well as assisting older unemployed in their transition to employment. The Government's policy of reducing the overall tax burden on labour is an incentive for older people to continue working, for women returners and older unemployed to seek and take up a job and for retired persons to return to the workforce, especially those who may wish to work part-time to supplement their income.</P>
      <P>As part of further initiatives in this area, it is my intention to meet with employer's representatives to see what practical steps can be taken to encourage the return of retired persons to the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Depending on the circumstances on retirement, a person can be either over-skilled or under-skilled for positions on offer to older people.

      <P>The purpose of these instruments is to strengthen the basis for judicial co-operation in civil and commercial matters and to develop further the uniform rules of private international law in the member states of the EU in certain areas. The proposed Brussels I Regulation deals with principles of jurisdiction and aims to speed up further the recognition and enforcement of judgments in both civil and commercial matters. The purpose of the Rome II Convention is to regulate the choice of law in tort and other non-contractual obligations.</P>
      <P>The original rules were designed to deal with jurisdiction, at a time before the world wide web was invented and before cross-border business and consumer trade, using the internet, had become commonplace. I am concerned that appropriate rules should be drawn up to deal with jurisdiction in the Internet economy and in the context of the new ways of doing business. The continuing discussions on this regulation should focus on providing a clear and supportive regulatory framework for e-commerce.</P>
      <P>Any new rules should take account of the realities of e-business. They should create a practical and workable regime, in which the rights of consumers can be protected, while providing clear rules which will encourage the growth of e-commerce.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Rome II Convention on the law, applicable to non-contractual obligations, the Commission proposes to present a revised draft instrument to Council in due course, prior to which a process of consultation is to be engaged in. We will consider the text, when available, against the backdrop of our concern to have workable common rules, which will encourage e-commerce and greater choice for the consumer.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to the achievement of balanced regional development over the period of the plan. The objective of balanced regional development will be achieved by focusing greater investment in infrastructural and industrial development in the regions over the period of the plan.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland, in pursuance of this objective, is committed to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One region in the coming years. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions. In addition, IDA is working with existing overseas companies in the regions generally to move them up the value chain by adding business functions of higher sophistication and complexity. This will improve the viability of these companies in the longer term.</P>
      <P>In establishing Enterprise Ireland in 1998, I specifically mandated the new agency to play a strong role in regional economic development. The agency has ten offices throughout the regions and works closely with local industry, development organisations and the third level sector to pro-actively facilitate an integrated approach to harnessing all of the resources relevant to industrial development in the region.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development is the regional development agency with responsibility for the mid-west region. One of Shannon Development's key plans, as outlined in its Corporate Plan 2000-2002, is to focus on &ldquo;sustaining economic development and achieving dispersal of that development throughout the region&rdquo;. Shannon Development's policy of dispersed development is aimed at spreading development to peripheral locations within its operational area.</P>

      <P>The challenges posed by the digital economy are not only technological but, to a large extent, strategic in nature. Ireland must ensure in the immediate future that not only are the basic infrastructural requirements put in place but the full potential of ICTs is realised for the benefit of our enterprise and employment. In much the same way as we see convergence in the ICT area, a similar convergence and close collaboration between Departments and public agencies is necessary especially if the mix of policies to deliver on Ireland's e-business agenda are to be produced.</P>

    <P>&ndash;assisting business to adopt and harness the potential of ICT users through our development agency initiatives and by developing business and consumer trust in e-business through awareness campaigns in a public private partnership with the relevant sectoral organisations;</P>
    <P>&ndash;encouraging, through bodies such as the expert group on future skills needs, the education sector and FÁS, investment in people as well as technology; investment in educational-training initiatives designed to develop appropriate skills, to promote innovation, and to meet the emerging skills gaps, particularly in the ICT industries and e-business areas;</P>
    <P>&ndash;ensuring that initiatives such as the Technology Foresight Fund and the European Union's Framework Programme of Research, Technological Development and Demonstration 1998-2002, are used to establish Ireland as a location for world class research excellence in niche areas within the ICT and e-business areas;</P>
    <P>&ndash;by working closely with other Departments, to build a balanced e-regulation framework, which creates the necessary confidence and trust in e-business by enterprise and consumers alike and which encourages growth in the area. To ensure that the regulatory framework, including the increasing number of international legal instruments, is consistent with this Department's objectives for the promotion of the knowledge economy, and to encourage a global approach to regulation reflecting the transnational nature of e-business;</P>
    <P>At national level, by working with interested parties, including the social partners, consumer groups, internet service providers, etc. to bring forward codes of practice, where appropriate, to contribute to the proper functioning of the knowledge based <Col N="137" /> economy consistent with respecting the rights of business, citizens and consumers;</P>
    <P>&ndash;maximising the use of ICT in a client centred manner for the delivery of Government services to business, consumers and citizens. The Reach initiative, through which electronic services will be made available to the citizen, and the Revenue Commissioners' online system, were launched in recent weeks. Our own Department is currently developing BASIS, an online service, for all interactions between business and Government.</P>

      <P>The report of the independent group to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry was considered by the Government on 20 September 2000.</P>
      <P>The group reported that it found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour either in the pattern of cattle prices or in profits. It also concluded that price gaps between the producer and consumer are fully explained by the combined movement in farm-gate prices and post farm-gate costs and that there is no scope for alleged manipulation of prices by wholesalers and retailers.</P>
      <P>The group recommended that the status of collective negotiations, as sought by the farming organisations in the dispute that led to the inquiry, be clarified in the context of section 4(1) of the Competition Act, 1991, and Article 81(1) of the Treaty of Rome.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme was restructured during 1999 to take account of the fall in unemployment levels and to better target available places at older long-term unemployed persons. As part of this process and in consultation with the social partners a decision was taken to gradually reduce the numbers employed on CE. In this context it is necessary for FÁS, as the operational agency for the programme, to prioritise projects according to needs. FÁS currently gives priority to &ldquo;caring-support&rdquo; projects based in the community and voluntary sector, including services for disabled persons.</P>
      <P>My Department, in the context of the commitment under section 4.2.4 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, has initiated discussions with the Department of Health and Children with a view to determining the potential to mainstream services currently being delivered through CE to persons with disabilities. According to information received from FÁS, there are currently some 1,900 CE participants engaged in the provision of services to the disabled at a cost of approximately £15 million.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the employment and vocational training of people with disabilities transferred from the Department of Health and Children to my Department in June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July, I launched a new supported employment programme for people with disabilities, with a budget of £4 million per annum from my Department. The supported employment programme has the potential to place up to 750 <Col N="140" /> people with disabilities into open employment and is being administered by FÁS on behalf of my Department.</P>
    <P>In July, I also announced the introduction of grants to companies for disability awareness training and for the retraining of workers who acquire a disability. Disability awareness training will help to integrate people with disabilities into the workplace by providing co-workers with a better understanding of the needs and capabilities of people with disabilities. Employee retraining grants will enable employers to retrain workers who acquire a disability for employment in the same company and in the same job, if appropriate. The operational details of these schemes are being finalised by FÁS and will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness recognises that the social partners have a role to play in promoting the employment of people with disabilities. I have invited the social partners to submit proposals which will promote the employment of people with disabilities and my Department will provide funding to suitable proposals.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures I have outlined, the Government has made a number of further commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which fall within the ambit of my Department, aimed at improving employment opportunities for people with disabilities. These include an increased emphasis on progression from vocational training programmes to employment opportunities in the open labour market; increased funding and promotion of the employment support scheme, which provides a wage subsidy to employers who recruit people with disabilities; increased funding for the workplace-equipment adaptation grant scheme which provides grants to employers for adaptations to the workplace to accommodate people with disabilities and strengthening the profile of the positive to disability scheme, which recognises companies which take a positive approach to the employment of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 53 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I led a trade mission to China between 8 and 16 September last. The visit was organised in line with the Asia Strategy, which the Government approved last year.</P>
      <P>The trade mission included 60 representatives from 51 Irish companies, making it the largest trade mission ever to go from Ireland to Asia. The number of interested companies is an indication of both the possibilities offered by trade with China and the growing interest on the part of Irish businesses in developing their trading links with China. The education, engineering and IT sectors made up the majority of the companies represented.</P>
      <P>During the mission, I witnessed signing ceremonies, which concreted the relationships between Irish companies and their Chinese partners. I also attended the official opening of Kerry Ingredients office in China and of a new joint venture school operated by the Irish branch of International House and its local partner.</P>
      <P>I attended a major business reception, attended by over 250 of the Irish participants' local contacts and approximately 50 journalists, in Beijing and similar events in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>In Beijing, I had a substantive and wide-ranging meeting with Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who visited Ireland last April. I also met Premier Zhu Rongji, and I signed an inter-governmental agreement on co-operation in science and technology with the Chinese Minister for Science and Technology, Zhu Lilan.</P>
      <P>In Shanghai, in addition to meeting both the Mayor and Vice-Mayor of this important commercial city, I performed the official opening of Ireland's new Consulate General, the establishment of which was one of the elements of the Asia Strategy.</P>
      <P>In Hong Kong, I met the Financial Secretary, Donald Tsang, the Secretary for IT and Broadcasting, Carrie Yau and the Secretary for Commerce, Chau Tak-Hay.</P>
      <P>Throughout the visit, press interviews and press conferences were organised and provided excellent fora in which to promote knowledge of Ireland generally and of our business interests in particular.</P>
      <P>Given the high level of interest which the mission provoked both in Ireland and in China I am sure that we will see significant results over the coming years as the relationships between Irish companies and their Chinese counterparts develop.</P>
      <P>One immediate outcome will be the visits to Ireland of no less than five software delegations, a total of 54 business people, from China between 31 October and 12 November. These visits will be organised by Enterprise Ireland which is also arranging for six top Chinese journalists to visit Ireland in the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the summer, from 7 to 10 June 2000, I led a trade mission including 28 companies to the <Col N="142" /> Slovak and Czech Republics. This was the first ever trade mission from Ireland to the Slovak Republic and the largest ever to the Czech Republic.</P>
    <P>In addition to the official elements of the visits, I witnessed several signatures between Irish companies and their local partners and attended a number of business functions designed to assist Irish companies to develop and cement their relationships with their local contacts. Media events helped to raise Ireland's profile as a world class supplier of goods and services locally.</P>
    <P>Trade missions such as these supplement the excellent work done by our representatives overseas, and in particular by Enterprise Ireland, to promote Ireland as a source of high quality goods and services. However, it is the solid and daily work of the companies themselves to develop their sales which ultimately provides the economic benefit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Based on what I have seen on these missions, and on what I know from my contacts with Irish business, I am sure that Ireland's excellent trade performance over the past number of years will continue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 57, 61 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current authorised staffing level of the Competition Authority is 29, comprising chair and four members, including the director of competition enforcement, assistant principal &ndash; sec<Col N="143" /> retary to the authority, two HEOs, two EOs, seven COs, seven economists and five legal advisers. This includes two senior legal advisers and three senior economists which were sanctioned for the authority this year.</P>
    <P>There are currently vacancies for five economists, three legal advisers and three administrative staff in the authority. Interviews for the recruitment of the vacant positions of economist and legal advisor have now been held and these posts will be filled shortly. The three administrative staff will be filled in the normal way by transfer within the Department.</P>
    <P>The vacancies have placed constraints on the authority's capacity to undertake its work. However, I am confident this will now change as the newly recruited staff take up their positions.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the situation regarding staffing is tackled comprehensively, my Department, together with the authority, is currently involved with outside consultants in a study of the authority's operations with a view to having its future resource requirements assessed. All staffing issues are being dealt with in the study and it is intended to address any recommendations when the final report is to hand.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to ensuring that the authority is adequately resourced to discharge its important statutory functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of days lost due to industrial disputes has generally declined throughout the decade of the 1990s. Figures published by the Central Statistics Office confirm that the number of days lost during the 1990s is far less than in the 1980s. This continues an overall downward trend in the numbers of days lost since the highs of the 1970s. In 1999 there were 32 industrial disputes recorded compared with 34 in the previous year. In the fourth quarter of 1999, however, there was a sharp increase in the number of days lost through industrial action. The nurses' strike in October 1999 was the largest dispute during the year and its effects can be seen in the figures for the final quarter of 1999, when 178,532 days were lost, equating to 83% of the total for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any increase in the level of industrial action gives rise to concern, particularly in an era of social partnership which has produced great benefits for all. Significant among these is the high level of industrial harmony that has become a notable feature of contemporary workplace <Col N="144" /> relations. Continued commitment to national social partnership is essential if we are to maintain the success we have achieved.</P>
    <P>The most recent CSO figures for days lost due to industrial disputes this year, published at the end of September, show a continuing decline in the number of days lost with just 26,353 days lost during the first half of this year, compared with 28, 191 in the same period last year.</P>
    <P>In keeping with our voluntarist tradition, the State provides dispute resolution facilities to assist parties resolve their differences through agreed procedures. The vast majority of disputes are resolved amicably by parties who make full use of these procedures.</P>

      <P>The Government decision of 26 July 1999 allows asylum seekers who had arrived in the country before that date to seek employment as their application for asylum crossed the 12 month threshold. There are <Col N="147" /> no plans to change that decision at this time. Some 4,000 are now entitled to seek work.</P>
      <P>FÁS has established a dedicated unit to assist eligible asylum seekers to find employment and has been conducting skills audits at centres in both Tallaght and Blanchardstown with very positive results. The process used is a series of structured interviews, the aim of which is to establish a profile of the education and employment history of the asylum seeker. During the interview process, a range of assessments are used to determine levels of technical-language skills. This provides each individual with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and abilities. The outcome of the interviews and skills assessments are used to ascertain the type of work each individual is best suited to within the Irish jobs market.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers who have been granted the entitlement to seek employment are eligible for training and education supports. The FÁS asylum seekers unit has introduced a three week intensive English language training programme which is followed by a seven week access to employment programme which focuses on orientation to the labour market in Ireland and includes English language training and IT training modules. To date, approximately 800 people have attended the units.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has provided that asylum seekers who gain employment may retain the rent allowance granted to them so that its loss may not be a possible disincentive.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the establishment of a special working group to identify the key essential services provided through the community employment programme, CE, and assess the implications of these services for community employment in terms of budget, number of places and objectives of the programme. This work is being undertaken by the standing committee on the labour market, formally the Partnership 2000 standing committee on labour market opportunities.</P>
      <P>The mainstreaming of essential services is being progressed directly with relevant Departments before reporting to the standing committee on the labour market on the outcome of these discussions. Consultations with the Department of Education and Science on the mainstreaming of CE schools services relating to school secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants are well advanced, and I expect that proposals will be ready for consultation with the social partners within four weeks. Consultations have also been initiated with the Department of Health and Children on the potential for the mainstreaming of CE personal assistant services for disabled persons.</P>
      <P>The standing committee on the labour market in its present form has met three times this year to date. Further meetings of the committee for the purpose of the mainstreaming consultations will be convened as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I look forward to early progress in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> The dynamic inherent in an enterprise-driven global economy can result in the movement of firms between countries and regions. Ireland has benefited, and continues to benefit, from such movement. Any Irish losses have tended to be in lower productivity firms. Changing market circumstances will challenge both indigenous and foreign firms alike to look at market-driven solutions to business issues. Not only will indigenous Irish firms locate in other economies for reasons of cost but also to be closer to customers or to gain access to relevant distribution networks.</P>
    <P>Progressive companies located in Ireland realise that they must continually upgrade the level of their current activities to keep pace with the ever-changing economic environment in which they operate. Part of this forward planning can involve relocating lower value added activities to lower wage economies. I am aware of a number of instances of such relocation, which can be regarded as a sign of our dynamic economy and the achievements of our firms rather than a negative development.</P>
    <P>The thrust of enterprise policy is to address the ever more competitive nature of the global economy by providing firms with relevant support to radically improve their productivity and ability to compete. To be competitive, firms must develop the technical capability and management skills to move up the value-added chain into more profitable markets and products. Building Irish firms with competitive scale and strong positions in international niche markets often requires that they not alone build up competence and capability at home but also make strategic investments in other economies. Such investments can be of long-term benefit to Ireland and have not so far been shown to restrict economic or employment growth at home.</P>
    <P>A key focus of the agencies' strategy is to raise quality and enhance capability within firms to enable them to compete on ever tighter world markets. Much has been done by the industrial development agencies to ensure that firms are not over-dependent on wage rates and can maintain a strong presence in Ireland if they so wish. Such firms have been encouraged and assisted to move into specialist niche markets, to upgrade their production and design systems to best international standards, to concentrate on research and development and innovation, and to increase their levels of employee training and development. I am confident that this strategy will enable Irish industry to compete and withstand the pressures of globalisation in all sectors in the coming years.</P>

      <P>The current staff complement for the work permits section in relation to issuing work permits stands at 14. The length of time taken to deal with an application for a work permit to employ a non-European economic area national will always depend on the individual circumstances of the case concerned. In the first six months of this year the average monthly number of applications received was about 1,420 which was a significant increase on the level in the same period for 1999. After a considerable effort by my Department involving the allocation of three additional staff, procedural simplification and overtime working, the processing time was reduced to about 15 working days by late July.</P>
      <P>However, the numbers of applications received in July, August and September were 1,650, 2,116 and 2,366 respectively. This level of increase, combined with staff turnover, has clearly placed pressure on resources and the processing time has been pushed out to about six weeks. A range of streamlining and organisational initiatives are being taken to speed up the processing of applications and this will be supplemented by further staff increases as appropriate. My objective is to get processing time down to around one week.</P>

      <P>I established the review group on auditing, under the chairmanship of Senator O'Toole, following from the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into DIRT. The report of the review group, published in July, is the first occasion since the foundation of the State that the subject of auditing has received such detailed attention. I was extremely pleased with the work of the review group and the comprehensive nature of its final report. The final report contains 80 far-reaching recommendations covering the following four main areas: the regulation of the accounting profession; auditor independence; the role of the auditor in ensuring compliance with statutory provisions; and the auditing of financial institutions.</P>
      <P>These recommendations will involve statutory changes particularly to the Companies Acts and the Central Bank Acts as well as changes to the constitutions and professional standards of the main professional accountancy bodies. The report also recommends the establishment of an oversight board to supervise the regulation by the accountancy bodies of their members' professional standards.</P>
      <P>I gave an opportunity to the professional accountancy bodies, the users of accountancy services and the public in general to make known to me their views on this report and particularly on its recommendations. To date my Department has received 31 submissions on the report and these submissions are currently being considered. Following from this I intend to present a package of proposals to Government to seek approval to implement the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the review group's report address a centrally important area of corporate governance which, in conjunction with the Company Law Enforcement Bill, will give us the kind of regulatory framework we need to ensure there is an effective system of corporate governance in place in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>Since 12 June last, I considered my authorised officer's report on IIB Bank Ltd., formerly known as Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd. and I have forwarded a copy, as permitted under section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, to the High Court Inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd., the Moriarty and Flood tribunals of inquiry, the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>On 27 July last, the Ansbacher inspectors obtained a High Court Order requiring the issue of a Letter of Request to the Royal Court of Guernsey in the Channel Islands for the purpose of assisting the inspectors' inquiry. I expect that it will be at least six months before this inquiry can be completed.</P>
      <P>On 28 July last, the High Court decided to quash my appointment of an authorised officer to Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Ltd. under section 19 of the 1990 Act. My appeal against this decision will shortly be lodged with the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>On 31 July last, the inspectors to National Irish Bank Ltd., and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd. submitted a further interim report to the High Court relating to their inquiry. I hope that the inspectors' inquiry can be concluded early in 2001.</P>
      <P>As previously indicated, five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing at present in my Department under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Ltd., College Trustees Ltd., Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Ltd., Hamilton Ross Co. Ltd., and Kentford Securities Ltd. I hope to receive final reports on a number of these companies in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc., Garuda Ltd., and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd. are with the DPP.

      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of science graduates to the future development of the Irish economy and of the need to ensure that supply increases to meet the needs of society at large. To assist in this objective, my Department has introduced a number of initiatives to satisfy the requirements of the relevant industry sectors in the coming years. These include establishing the expert group on future skills needs, the skills awareness group, and the science technology and awareness programme, all of which are administered by Forfás on behalf of my Department. The aim of these initiatives is to assess future skills requirements, to inform students of the opportunities for and benefits of a career in the science field and to notify them of the third level choices available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The awareness programme also endeavours to demonstrate to all the importance of science, technology and innovation in developing leading <Col N="154" /> edge industries and skilled jobs in the economy, and details the exciting career opportunities that stem from study in this area. It also highlights the creative opportunities for children arising in the sciences. In addition to these initiatives, my Department's science and technology development programme enhances career prospects for scientific graduates by funding research in industry, including some direct funding for students undertaking post-graduate training in research.</P>
    <P>I draw the Deputy's attention specifically to the second report of the expert group on future skills needs. Using data from the CSO and the Higher Education Authority, the group constructed a model to estimate the supply of and demand for chemical and biological science graduates up to the year 2005. The group's recommendations, which are designed to prevent the possible opening of a skills gap, are currently being given active consideration by a range of agencies and Departments, with a view to appropriate implementation. Their effect should be seen in the increased numbers involved in the sciences in due course.</P>
    <P>Success will be dependent on a concerted effort between Government, the industrial development agencies, the education sector and relevant companies. I am confident that their combined endeavours will ensure sufficient supply to meet the requirements of the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic provisions of company law currently provide that decisions at shareholders meetings are normally taken by way of a show of hands in the first instance and secondly by means of a poll. In the case of a show of hands, each member at the meeting and entitled to vote has one vote only, irrespective of the number of shares he or she holds. However in the case of a poll, every member shall have one vote for each share carrying voting rights which he or she holds. The effect of this is that the extent of the members shareholding is taken fully into account and thereby ensures that voting rights are more equitably divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because a vote on a show of hands disregards the extent of the members shareholdings, clearly this is not an entirely satisfactory method of ascertaining the members wishes. For this reason the Companies Acts protects the right, recognised at common law, of members to demand a poll. Section 137 of the Companies Act, 1963, provides that any provision contained in a company's articles of association which excludes the right to demand a poll on any question shall be void. The <Col N="155" /> basic provision of company law is that a valid demand for a poll can be made by five members present in person or by proxy. A valid demand for a poll can also be made by the chairman of the company, who will normally exercise that power where there is any doubt as to whether a vote on a show of hands truly represents the majority view of the members on a matter of importance.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to alter the basic requirements of company law in relation to voting rights. To do so would be to undermine the one share one vote principle which would be difficult to argue against from an equity and fairness viewpoint.</P>

Because of the large number of applications for work permits received by my Department in recent months &ndash; 2,360 in September alone &ndash; the average waiting time for dealing with applications at present is about six weeks.

      <Quest> the categories of new industry that have set up here over the past five years; if she has satisfied herself that Ireland has attracted a broad range of industries and that it will be able to sustain its employment record; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The attached table shows the numbers of jobs created over the past five years, broken down by industry sector. It is clear from the figures that three sectors have performed exceptionally well, namely, electrical and optical equipment, internationally-traded services, and food and beverages. The internationally-traded services category includes financial services, software, and telemarketing operations. However, it is also evident from the table that the remaining job gains have been spread across all industry sectors, inspiring confidence that we will be able to sustain our employment record in the future.</P>
      <P>To enable us to achieve this goal in the coming decade, a number of actions, which are focused on safeguarding Ireland's location as a base for job creation, will have to be taken. These include a shift towards higher-value sectors, increasing productivity in existing firms, upgrading the skills profile of the workforce, and expanding the number of firms engaged in research and development. It will also be necessary to achieve more balanced spatial development of economic activities, and to redirect agency assistance from capacity to capability support in areas such as human resource development, R&amp;D, marketing and market development. The national development plan indicates clearly the steps that are to be taken to give effect to work in these areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86, 99 and 100 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surveys of employers' vacancies have been carried out in 1996, 1997 and 1998 by the ESRI on <Col N="160" /> behalf of FÁS and Forfás. The latest published survey refers to the position in late 1998-early 1999. It shows that at the time of the survey, 27% of enterprises had vacancies and 24% of enterprises had vacancies that they found difficult to fill. Such problems were much more common among larger firms. Half of all large firms had difficult to fill vacancies. There were 53,600 vacancies in total &ndash; a rate of 6% of employment in the firms surveyed.</P>
    <P>In terms of types of vacancies and the severity of shortages, the most severe shortages were for computer and engineering specialists. Skilled craftspersons were in short supply and lower skilled occupations in the services sector also showed significant unfilled vacancies.</P>
    <P>The 1999-00 data have not yet been published, however, I understand that preliminary analysis of the data shows that percentage of firms with vacancies has risen to 31%, and the vacancy rate to 6.5%. As with the previous survey, vacancies have been found to exist throughout the economy at all skills levels.</P>
    <P>It can be concluded therefore that Ireland is experiencing skills and labour shortages in certain sectors-areas. This finding is not unexpected given our record rates of economic growth and <Col N="161" /> continuing falls in unemployment consequential upon this. It is an indication of success in implementing a range of interrelated economic, structural and labour market policies.</P>
    <P>The Government is pursuing a wide range of measures to ensure that the economy can continue grow. These measures are aimed at both increasing the labour supply and improving productivity. Key policies being pursued include increases in supply of training and education places to meet identified and emergent skills shortages, as set out in the second report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs; continuing investment in the apprenticeship system to meet increasing demand for training and reduce waiting times in the provision of off the job training; greater emphasis on capability building and innovation by Enterprise Ireland, aimed at increasing the productivity and competitiveness of indigenous enterprises; measures to encourage increased participation in the labour force as set out in the National Employment Action Plan 2000; increasing numbers of work permits issued and institution of the working visas system for designated categories of workers; establishment of a task force on lifelong learning within the framework of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The taskforce is considering measures required to improve access to learning and upskilling opportunities and aims to bring proposals to Government early next year; and an institution of the national training fund to provide increased resources for upskilling.</P>
    <P>I propose to introduce legislation to establish the fund before year end.</P>

      <P>The ban on below cost selling is one of the provisions of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987. This order was the subject of one of 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law, including the groceries order, and the administration of mergers law in the final report of the competition and mergers review group which I published in May last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of the groceries order, the majority of the review group recommended that the groceries order be repealed; any legislation or regulation introduced in relation to the grocery trade should not include a ban on below cost selling; and some form of regulation be introduced in relation to the grocery trade which would in <Col N="162" /> particular require suppliers to publish the terms on which they are prepared to trade with retailers, would require retailers to honour the credit terms on which suppliers are prepared to trade with them, would ban &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, and would require retailers not to discriminate between classes of customers in respect of the products which they sell.</P>
    <P>I am considering this recommendation and I will make a decision on it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the year the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, which has responsibility for enforcing the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, has received 12 complaints concerning possible instances of below cost selling. The four investigations completed by the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to date show no evidence of below cost selling.</P>

      <P>Concerns about the level of premiums for motor insurance have caused our Department to examine the factors contributing to the relatively high level of those premiums, especially as compared with premiums in other EU member states. The main objective of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which I re-established in 1998, is to examine the contributory factors to the cost of insurance in Ireland and also to examine possible initiatives towards reducing premiums.</P>
      <P>It must be stressed, however, that comparison of Irish motor insurance premiums with those in other EU member states is not always feasible, because of different systems, for providing compensation. I am examining ways of making our system more efficient.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to encourage as many insurers as possible to compete on the Irish market so that the most competitive quotes are available to the Irish consumer. The implementation of EU legislation and opening up the EU market to competition from all European insurers has made this possible.</P>

      <P>As recent Competitive Challenge and Annual Competitiveness <Col N="163" /> Report 2000 publications of the National Competitiveness Council indicate, we continue to improve our competitiveness. Both those documents have been laid in the Oireachtas Library. This improvement is reflected in the fact that Ireland now ranks fifth in this year's global competitiveness index compiled by the World Economic Forum; a remarkable achievement by any score.</P>
      <P>Our success is attributed to our attractiveness based on a well designed incentive policy for high technology manufacturing, services and financial activities and our long-term investment in education, training and up-skilling programmes.</P>
      <P>In our case it also underlines once more the imperative of securing a stable, predictable and moderate agreement between the social partners, as represented by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF. That programme recognises the need to strengthen our main enterprise sectors, especially small business and the services sectors, promote indigenous industry, especially food, marine and forestry, address labour and skills shortages in the short and long term, accelerate the pick up of e-commerce and use of IT throughout our economy and government, and to take up the challenge posed by the exploration and exploitation of R&amp;D in science and technology necessary to stay ahead.</P>

      <P>The principal raw material for the foreign owned textile companies based in Ireland is a chemical polymer which is 100% imported for the production of polyester and nylon fibres.</P>
      <P>The indigenous textile industry is an industry that is based on traditional strengths. The changes within the industry have been market driven. In recent years the market has been a niche one supplying top end manufacturers and designers with wool and linen products. This market still remains but customers within it have become more demanding in terms of design and finishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to these market demands, Enterprise Ireland, in conjunction with the industry, identified a number of areas that could be improved in design and finishing. A number of initiatives to improve these areas have been undertaken recently and they include trend fore<Col N="164" /> casting twice yearly, market study visits abroad, new product development support, and design improvement incentives.</P>
    <P>A joint North-South initiative was undertaken earlier this year, involving Enterprise Ireland, Industrial Development Board, Northern Ireland, Irish Linen Guild, the International Fund for Ireland and nine participating companies, four from Northern Ireland and five from the Republic of Ireland. The objective of this promotional initiative was to jointly promote the linen and wool products of Ireland to international buyers overseas under the common brand Fabric Ireland. The project was launched at Premiere Vision, a leading world textile show, in Paris on 2 March 2000 and the outcome has been extremely successful. Companies report that buyer interest has increased following this promotion and are confident of attaining a 30% increase in sales over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The Irish leather industry is focused on the manufacture of wet blue hides, which is an intermediate raw material sold to leather finishers outside the country. There is little, if any, production of finished leather in Ireland suitable for conversion into clothing, footwear, upholstery, etc.</P>
    <P>Leather conversion and finishing operations have in general moved to low cost countries in the Far East due to lower labour costs. Primary processing of hides is tending to follow the conversion and finishing sectors to developing countries where, in addition to lower wage rates, environmental regulations tend to be less demanding.</P>
    <P>One exception to this is the production of finished automotive and furniture upholstery. This is a very difficult market to break into because of the tendency of the automotive industry to work with a limited number of proven suppliers of finished leather. A few Irish companies here have developed outlets to these markets for wet blue raw material. Competition, however, is intense with major integrated US beef processors with large-scale operations dictating the economics of the business.</P>

      <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche, management consultants were commissioned in 1996 to undertake a study on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland. Comparisons with other jurisdictions were made in respect of public liability and motor insurance. The study found that premium rates in Ireland were higher than in other EU countries surveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that the two major factors driving up the cost of personal injury settlements in Ireland were medical inflation and the high transactions cost of claims, particularly legal costs, including the cost of <Col N="166" /> expert witnesses. In response to these findings, a special working group was established under the aegis of our Department.</P>
    <P>The special working group, as part of its remit, commissioned research into the processing of personal injury claims in Ireland and the United Kingdom as well as a research based study of personal injury compensation systems in operation in other European countries, in New Zealand and in the United States. However, this research did not specifically address the issue of public liability insurance cover in the various countries.</P>
    <P>We are currently in the process of examining the recommendations contained in the special working group's second and final report on a personal injuries tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report also identified improved health and safety measures in the workplace as a way of reducing costs. I would regard the initiatives on the establishment of affinity schemes for small businesses and the development of a voluntary code of practice, in safe working and accident prevention, as significant and positive measures being taken by Irish business, through a social partnership approach, to reduce the cost burden of accidents in the workplace.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's continuing commitment to improve the job opportunities for the more disadvantaged sectors of society, I recently launched a new programme aimed at providing sustainable jobs for long-term unemployed and disadvantaged communities. The social economy programme will provide opportunities for those in long-term unemployment who are finding it most hard to get or hold on to jobs despite the booming economy. The innovative approach in this programme &ndash; the setting up of social economy enterprises &ndash; will tackle both these aspects of the social inclusion agenda. As well as providing employment, the programme will play an important role in regenerating local economies and improving the quality of life in local communities. The aim is to invest up to £41 million per annum in social economy enterprises. A total of £213 million has been provided in the national <Col N="167" /> development plan up to 2006 and the objective is to create the equivalent of 2,500 jobs by 2003.</P>

    <P>A major focus of Ireland's, and the EU's, relationship with Algeria is the human rights situation in that country, which remains a serious cause of concern. As part of the dialogue, the EU has encouraged necessary reforms, modernisation and improvements in human rights, and has offered constructive assistance through the partnership. In this partnership dialogue, Ireland has sought to maintain a strong focus on human rights and the promotion of the role of civil society.</P>
    <P>With up to one third of its population unemployed, and one third under 30, social and economic stability in Algeria are extremely important and can provide the basis for a peaceful future in that country. Negotiations to conclude an association agreement with Algeria had been dormant since 1997, but were resumed in April of this year. Negotiations are conducted by the commission on behalf of the EU. As with other agreements, this should include further commitments by Algeria to democratisation and the rule of law. It is my understanding that negotiations with Algeria are still at a preliminary stage and I do not expect either side to be in a position to sign such an agreement in the near future.</P>
    <P>These negotiations must, of course, be fully consistent with human rights commitments under the Barcelona declaration. Each partner country in the process has made specific commitments under the declaration to act in accordance with the UN charter and the universal declaration of human rights. The partnership also commits states to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. This is one of its fundamental pillars. Algeria is also party to a number of human rights conventions, including the international covenants on civil and political rights, and on economic, social and cultural rights, and the convention against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It remains our concern that these commitments are fully implemented in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the comments made by Mr. John Fitzgerald, the Dublin city manager, in regard to the inadequacies in current legislation concerning the control by local authorities of telecommunications related roadworks.</P>
      <P>Under current legislation, the only powers relating to the control of telecommunications related roadworks lie with the local authorities. The Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Seanad, contains specific proposals aimed at clarifying these powers.</P>
      <P>Once this Bill is enacted, telecommunications operators will be required to obtain the consent of the local authority before they can open a road to lay telecommunications infrastructure in that authority's functional area. Under section 15 of the Bill, a local authority will be able to make its consent subject to specific conditions enabling it to co-ordinate road openings and to require operators to share trenches and provide spare ducts for future use by other telecommunications operators. The Bill also contains provisions dealing with the apportionment of costs for road reinstatement and proposes giving the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the power to make regulations to establish, <i>inter alia</i>, a standard basis for the calculation of these costs.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the provisions in the Bill, it was important to give balanced consideration to the needs of local authorities in terms of road management within their functional areas and the need to put in place a regime that would not act as a barrier to the competitive rollout of high quality modern communications infrastructure throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>I expect that, once enacted, this Bill will help us achieve the type of infrastructure needed to deliver the benefits of advanced communications services to both business and the public, as well as help in reducing considerably the disruptions being caused at present by telecommunications related road openings.</P>

      <P>An independent consultant will be commissioned to examine and make recommendations on selection.

      <P>My Department is the competent authority under the EU regulations governing the organic sector and is required to set up an inspection system operated by one or more designated inspection authorities and-or by approved inspection bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2092/91 and on 24 August 2000 this regulation was supplemented by Regulation 1804/99 which sets standards for organic livestock produce. Under Regulation 2092/91 my Department has approved three private bodies to inspect and certify organic crop produce. These bodies, in a private capacity, had also been certifying organic livestock produce to standards that they themselves had set. When the livestock sector was brought within the ambit of Regulation 2092/91 in August, however, my Department as the competent authority was obliged to make arrangements for its inspection.</P>
    <P>The AgriFood 2010 Report had included a recommendation that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited, for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently considering these proposals and I am hopeful for a positive response.</P>
    <P>Funding for an inspection system has been included in my Department's Estimate for 2001. While provision has been made in the Estimates for a scheme for development of the organic sector under the regional operational programmes, the details of the supports under the scheme, including consideration of any potential involvement of groups such as Organic Trust, IOFGA and Demeter, have not yet been finalised.</P>

      <P>The standard costings used by my Department to cost works eligible for grant aid under the on-farm investment schemes were reviewed immediately prior to the introduction of the national scheme of investment aid for the control of farm pollution in June 1999 . Following the review, a 12% increase was applied to the costings which had been employed under the Control of Farm Pollution Scheme 1994-99. The standard costings are considered to be a fair reflection of the average cost of carrying out such investments, excluding value added tax.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, there is a commitment to an annual review of the standard costings used to determine grant aid payable under the on-farm investment measures.</P>
      <P>The applicant concerned was issued with written approval to convert an existing loose house to a slatted house and to construct an effluent tank under the national scheme for the control of farm pollution on 28 September 1999. The measurements of the proposed investments were calculated and costed at £15,349.74 using standard costings. Grant aid at the rate of 40% of the standard cost was approved.</P>
      <P>A final inspection of the investment works on 15 May 2000 revealed that the dimensions were less than those provided for in the approval document. Accordingly, the costings were re-calculated at £13,984.81. Based on grant rate of 40%, the applicant was paid £5,593.92 on 22 September 2000.</P>

      <P>The Mount Street crèche is run by the Civil Service Crèche Co-operative Limited.</P>
      <P>As child care is an important part of our employment and labour market policies, the Government provides the premises free of charge and meets electricity and heating costs.</P>
      <P>Up to recently, the crèche had been operated under licence by a manager appointed by the co-operative.</P>
      <P>However, in September the co-operative decided to allow the licence to expire and to appoint a new manager. The co-operative is now having discussions with a private crèche management company with a view to engaging it to run the Mount Street crèche.</P>
      <P>My Department has been working very closely with the co-operative in the matter.</P>
      <P>Following the closure of the crèche, an inspection of the premises by the Eastern Health Board revealed a number of problems with the premises which must be tackled before the crèche can reopen. I understand that the Office of Public Works is about to place a contract for the refurbishment work which will allow the crèche to open no later than early November.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties that the present closure causes parents. I know how important good child care is for both children and working parents.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am determined that the Mount Street crèche will open as soon as possible once the mandatory health board standards have been complied with.</P>

      <P>Two reports were received from the South Western area Health Board, the first on 25 August 2000 in response to an oral request made by a departmental official the previous day and the second on 1 September in response to a further request made on 28 August 2000.</P>
      <P>Information was also sought from the Garda <i>via</i> the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 28 August and this was received on 4 October 2000.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of all reports and having discussed the matter with the parents of the child in question, I asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority to initiate a complete case review. I believe that lessons can be learned from the handling of this case which will lead to improved services for other troubled children in the future.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I met the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority on 9 October last to discuss the format of the review. We agreed that the review will be conducted by an independent person who will report by the end of the year. The review will examine in particular whether the services provided were adequate and appropriate and will make recommendations.</P>
      <P>In addition, the social services inspectorate is conducting an inspection of the residential centre in question and I am not in a position to draw any definitive conclusions until the outcome of both the case management review and the report of the inspectorate are to hand.</P>
      <P>In regard to a protocol for the reporting of missing minors, I should clarify that, in this case, the management of the centre in question reported the matter to the Garda without delay. However, I will consider this issue and my officials will liaise with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the matter.</P>
      <P>This is a tragic case and I sympathise with the parents and family of the child in question.</P>

      <P>This project has developed with the support of a number of agencies, including FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as well as the Department of Health and Children. I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board and I understand the services provided which relate to this Department are mainly the pre-school services which will cater for 50 children on a daily basis. It is intended that ten of these places will be allocated to disadvantaged families and will be part funded from the Southern Health Board's pre-schools budget.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board also intends funding the salary of the administrator who will take over from the project manager when the service is up and running. This contribution will be in the region of £30,000 per annum. Lottery funding of £15,000 in 1996, £50,000 in 1997 and £25,000 in 1999 was made available by this Department towards the cost of providing a new premises. In addition, a grant of £50,000 was made available in 1998 by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>A further application for lottery funding has been made in respect of 2000. The number of applications for lottery funding far exceeds the resources available. Each application is considered on its merits having regard to the overall funding available, the number of applications received and also the level of funding previously made available. This application is one of a number of applications currently being considered. As soon as a decision has been made my Department will be in contact with the project sponsors.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, does not impose any restriction on private nursing home charges, as this is a matter for determination by the proprietors of individual homes. Accordingly, my Department has no function in relation to the setting of private nursing home fees nor does it compile information on charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. There are three rates of subvention &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash;<Col N="180" /> in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum. While there has been no increase in the subvention rate, the amount of funding allocated to the scheme has been significantly increased by this Government.  The total expenditure on the scheme is estimated at £38.4 million. This compares with £4 million in 1993. In the current year, additional funding of over £5 million has been allocated to the health boards to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The question of an increase in the rate of subvention is being kept under review in the light of competing demands for other improvements in services for older people.</P>

I would encourage persons at risk of contracting the disease, especially those over 65, to discuss vaccination against influenza with their general practitioner if they have not already done so. It is also important that general practitioners ensure that the at-risk patients in their practice are contacted and invited to attend for vaccination.</P>

The initial deadline for submission of town renewal plans to my Department was 1 November 1999; however, this was subsequently extended to 31 December 1999 to afford county councils more time to produce good quality plans.</P>
      <P>County councils were advised that the extent of proposed designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plan should be proposed for designation.

      <P>The role of the expert panel set up by me was to assess the local authorities proposals and recommend sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by the local authorities; the panel confined to examining the sites recommended by the local authorities by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines. The panel comprised individuals with a broad range of relevant expertise in urban planning, architecture, conservation etc.</P>
      <P>In the course of its examination of the plans, the panel sought clarification from local authorities in relation to various issues where this was considered necessary. The expert advisory panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sites to be designated. The recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations are now being implemented. It is not proposed to make any further designations under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The sites proposed for designation by the local authorities, examined by the expert panels and subsequently approved for designation followed a very detailed, structured and well thought out process. I do not consider that any late submissions can be considered at this stage. My priority now is to ensure that the scheme is implemented effectively in order to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved.</P>

      <P>Since 1 October 1998, new cars being put on the market within the European Union must conform to the EU whole vehicle type approval standard. This standard consists of some 54 individual vehicle component standards addressing safety and environmental requirements. These include standards for headlamps and headlamp bulbs.</P>
      <P>The tests which must be passed before a type approval certificate can be issued are set out in detail in the separate directives covering each of the 54 items. They are carried out under the supervision of the type approval authority to which the application for type approval is made by a vehicle manufacturer and normally involve the assistance of specialised accredited laboratories. The National Standards Authority of Ireland has been designated as the type approval authority in relation to any applications by manufacturers which may be brought within the Irish jurisdiction.</P>

The requirements apply, <i>inter alia</i>, to a range of safety critical items including maximum weights and dimensions, equipment including steering, visibility, the safety of glass, windscreen wipers, mirrors, speedometers, horns, brakes, seatbelts, tyres and lights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, local authorities currently receive significant Exchequer funding for a wide range of their operations. I have not received a request from any local authority seeking to change this in favour of full financial autonomy, but I would be happy to consider any such proposal should it be put forward.</P>
      <P>Under the present system, there are certain services which local authorities deliver which are essentially national in character &ndash; national roads, higher education grants etc. It is appropriate in these cases that financial support from central Government should be conditional on national objectives being met. That said, local authorities already have considerable autonomy in raising income and in determining the priorities for expenditure and the levels of expenditure on most individual services and programmes. Each year local authorities adopt their own estimate of expenses setting out their revenue raising and expenditure plans for the following year. The adoption of the estimate is a matter entirely for the local authority itself. Expenditure provided for in the estimate is funded from a variety of sources including rates, fees and charges for services, the Local Government Fund and other State grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are empowered to collect commercial rates which are a major source of local finance. The setting of the annual rate in the pound in the context of the adoption of the annual estimate of expenses is a decision taken locally by the elected members of the individual local authorities. The elected members adopt the rate which they consider necessary in order to provide the range of services for their area. In the current year it is estimated that rates will generate income of about £456 million or 25% of all <Col N="188" /> local authority current income. In 1999 and 2000, I capped rate increases at 5%. The decision to cap rates at this level was designed to allow authorities scope to determine the appropriate level of rate to meet their needs, while at the same time ensuring that the rate demand on the commercial sector was neither excessive nor disproportionate to other sectors of society.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are empowered by law to charge for the services they provide, with the exception of charges for domestic water and sewerage services. In the current year, it is estimated that income from charges will be about £505 million or 28% of all current income. It is a matter for the elected members of each local authority to decide whether or not to levy charges and the level of any such charges. Such decisions are at the absolute discretion of the local authority having regard to the needs of their area, the level and range of services to be provided and all the sources of revenue available to the authority to finance those services.</P>
    <P>Under a new system of funding which came into operation on 1 January, 1999, general-purpose grants and non-national road grants to local authorities are financed from the Local Government Fund. It is estimated that the fund will amount to some £660 million (36% of current income) this year. The additional resources being provided through the fund have increased the general level of funding available to authorities and accordingly, has allowed authorities greater discretion and flexibility in formulating and adopting spending plans. It is important to stress that it is at the complete discretion of local authorities as to how to spend their general-purpose grants. Local authorities also receive various State grants for specific purposes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied given that the combination of central and local sources of income are largely available for spending at the discretion of local authorities together with the fact that spending plans are adopted locally, affords local authorities considerable autonomy in their financial affairs.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group <Col N="189" /> took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and, of course, the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the extent to which general price inflation, including fuel price inflation, is impacting on the significant improvements in social welfare payments implemented in the last three budgets. I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but improving the overall position of social welfare recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I wish to point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment &ndash; ENP. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 75 private transport <Col N="190" /> operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published in April this year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services. In this regard, it notes that there are two main groups affected: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
    <P>The report notes that while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not obliged to provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles accessible to people with disabilities. These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for public transport.</P>
    <P>However, the review of the free schemes does recommend that a &lsquo;social transport fund' be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles. The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy. This proposal needs to be considered further by the relevant Government departments.</P>
    <P>The review also considered the issue of extending the free telephone rental allowance to include the cost of installing a telephone. The review considered that the Government's policy of care in the community should support measures to ensure that pensioners are not deprived of a telephone because of inadequate income or perceived fear of costs. It concluded that the provision of free installation should form part of the business negotiation on the future payment of the free telephone rental allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>The recommendations made in the review will be examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In budget 2000 I announced the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme. This benefit, which will be of 15 months duration, is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. It involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by my Department. This will be a non-means tested payment based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, is currently drawing up carer's leave legislation to protect the employment rights of the carer.</P>
      <P>The maximum duration of carer's benefit is set at 15 months as it is considered that employers would experience difficulties in preserving employee's rights for a longer period. This time period of 15 months will facilitate carers who have to leave the workforce temporarily to care full-time.</P>
      <P>In the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government pledged to put in place a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers. One of the key priorities is to develop a partnership model to facilitate the development, by the State in conjunction with the private sector, of an improved system for meeting long-term care costs.</P>
      <P>To this end, one of the remaining proposals arising from the review of the carer's allowance will be examined this year. A consultancy study will be undertaken to examine issues relating to long-term care, both in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard. This study will examine possible future schemes, the effects on the social insurance fund and estimate the number of people who might qualify. It is expected that this study will commence before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities and that my role is mainly to provide advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. I understand that South Dublin County Council has designated Riversdale House as a protected structure. It is, accordingly, a matter for South Dublin County Council, in the first instance, to take whatever action it considers appropriate, consistent with its new powers, to protect the character of this building. The question of compensation, in the event of a refusal of planning permission, is for resolution between the developer and the council. The Deputy will understand that I have no role to play in that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out that the State already has a sizeable portfolio of over 700 national monuments and historic properties which are in the care of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. The resources required to conserve <Col N="193" /> and manage such properties are already considerable and continue to increase. I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible for the Department to become involved in the acquisition of Riversdale House.</P>

      <P>As stated in my previous reply, the Monastery Chapel of St. Alphonsus became a protected structure on 1 January of this year under the terms of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. As provided for in the Act, both the exterior and the interior of the chapel are protected and in the absence of a declaration from Dublin Corporation, no works are permitted without planning permission. No such declaration has been applied for.</P>
      <P>I understand that an attempt was made by the developer to find a suitable buyer for the chapel and that this was advertised both in Ireland and internationally. Interest was shown by a number of parties but no interest was expressed which was compatible with the conservation of the chapel and the residential nature of the development.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the development has almost been completed, the developer has recommenced discussions with local community groups and conservationists in order to find a suitable use for the chapel. Hopefully, a solution will be found to the satisfaction of all parties.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the chapel continues to be protected under the terms of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): Due to the various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation in respect of a person of full age, together with the high number of applications being received, the average processing time is approximately two and a half years. In this instance, each applicant's case is well advanced, and it is likely that they will be completed in the near future.</P>

      <P>Decisions on special arrangements are taken having regard to the circumstances of each individual case. My Department takes these decisions in the first instance within a published framework of principles. I have ensured the availability of an independent appeal forum where a student is aggrieved with any aspect of my Department's decision.</P>
      <P>This year the concept of modification of the national standard assessment was introduced to accommodate the requirements of special needs students. This was a significant advance in the inclusiveness of our examination system. In essence, it allowed us to depart from a situation where a special needs student could be penalised by being required to undergo assessment in an element of an examination which was beyond his or her physical capacity. For example, the aural component of a language examination is clearly problematical for a deaf candidate and the new special arrangements mean that exemption from that component is possible in the case of such students.</P>
      <P>Where this greater flexibility and responsiveness means that an element of the examination is not assessed, as with all matters relating to the certificate examinations, this must occur openly and transparently. In the present year the provisional results issued to students were annotated in accordance with these principles.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that neither the leaving nor junior certificate results contained any reference to a candidate's disability. These results did no more than provide factual information on the actual assessment.</P>

      <P>The operational arrangements relating to the assessment and certification of apprentices under the standards based apprenticeship system which was agreed by all relevant groups were set out in a letter from my Department to the various institutes of technology in December 1995. The arrangements clearly stated that assessment for phase four would consist of two occasions of testing and that a terminal examination would apply only at the end of phase six of the apprenticeship system. This latter would be the only situation in which payment for an examination as part of the apprenticeship system would be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1999 it was brought to the attention of my Department that certain of the institutes of technology were conducting both occasions of phase four testing at the end of phase four. My Department subsequently issued circular letter No 1T 9/99 on the assessment regulations governing phase four procedures reiterating the position as set out in 1995. All directors of institutes of technology <Col N="197" /> and the president of Dublin Institute of Technology were directed to ensure that the sanctioned arrangements would be complied with.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this direction, the Department has been advised that in latter months certain phase four assessment results have been withheld by staff in the institutes, who are TUI members, who are seeking examination payments in respect of this testing. Efforts to resolve the dispute are ongoing.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I have recently received correspondence from the person referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As part of the minimum academic requirements specified by my Department for entry to primary teacher training, all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student's proficiency in Irish. My Department considers it to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels of the primary school.</P>
      <P>The Ceard Teastas is not regarded as an approved equivalent to the leaving certificate requirement for entry to primary teacher training.</P>
      <P>The approved equivalents to the leaving certificate Irish requirement for entry to the postgraduate course in primary teaching are a grade C in the matriculation examination, a pass in a University first arts examination in Irish or, in the case of Northern Ireland GCE applicants, a grade C in A level Irish.</P>
      <P>Requirements in this area are kept under review by my Department, in consultation with the authorities of the colleges of education, and are also being considered by the working group set up to review the full-time pre-service teacher training courses.</P>
