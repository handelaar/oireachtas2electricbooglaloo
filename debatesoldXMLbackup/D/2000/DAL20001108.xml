      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 44, Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Report Stage and Report and Final Stages; No. 45, Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed); No. 46, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed) and No. 47, Teaching Council Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed).

      <P>There are no proposals to be put to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government bring forward legislation to reintroduce the local education boards and decentralisation of education decision making, which the rainbow coalition had put in place, in light of the damning report of excessive bureaucracy and centralisation in the Department? Senior officials are obliged to spend their time invigilating the replacement of windows in rural schools rather than making national policy. Will the Taoiseach not agree that Fianna Fáil made a grave mistake when it reversed the work of Niamh Bhreathnach in decentralising education decision making, which would have improved educational performance for everybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such legislation planned. The Minister for Education and Science has brought forward an excellent report. What is required is management, organisation and the implementation of the report. The report highlighted practices which have existed in the Department for many years. There has to be a change to good management and organisation and the Minister will now proceed with implementation of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the weather, mercifully, has changed and we are no longer confronted with heavy rain, people are faced with devas<Col N="782" /> tation in many parts of the country. I have two simple questions for the Taoiseach, questions to which we could not get an answer yesterday. Will householders be compensated by the Government? When will they know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the reports are in from the local authorities and the Office of Public Works and cases are made for compensation. Under the practice which has been used a number of times, the humanitarian aspects of the claims are looked at and people will be funded in the same manner as has worked successfully before through the Office of Public Works and the local authorities. With regard to when, the Government will work on the reports as soon as they arrive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's reply. Will the Government buy space in the newspapers and other media to communicate with as much clarity as possible the answers to the questions I posed and to which the Taoiseach has given a reasonable reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With whom should people who believe they have a case for financial compensation address their case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, the Department of the Environment and Local Government through the local authorities and the Office of Public Works, the two organisations which can best make an assessment of the cases and the damage. That was the procedure used previously. We can clarify it in the next few days and, perhaps, set it out in an advertisement as was suggested by Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Act provided for the video taping of interviews conducted in Garda stations. Does the Taoiseach agree with the views expressed trenchantly by the Attorney General that the gardaí are foot dragging on this and lack the will to implement the provisions or was this another solo run by the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, the question is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate to know whether legislation enacted by the Oireachtas will be implemented&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will pursue it in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and if the Taoiseach shares the view of the senior law officer in the land that <Col N="783" /> the gardaí are foot dragging and lack the will to implement the Act. Is that the Government's view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy of the Taoiseach's speech to the Irish European Movement regarding enlargement of the EU. I presume there will be a substantial debate on it. Can the Taoiseach say when it will be held and will he guarantee that there will be a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a request for such a debate either prior to or after the Nice summit, I have no difficulty with the Whips arranging it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the speech with interest. The Taoiseach referred to the lack of adequate debate which follows various speeches. This is the forum for such a debate, before Nice and perhaps afterwards. Let us see what the Taoiseach goes to Nice with and what he returns with. Let the House indicate what Members would like the Taoiseach to negotiate on behalf of the Irish people and let us then conduct an analysis of the results. The debate should consist not of a series of statements but a set of responses whereby questions can be posed in a committee format. That would facilitate the proper debate sought. I support Deputy Deasy's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many precedents for this. I am sure Deputy Quinn would want me to do precisely what we did regarding the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty when he was in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I want the Taoiseach to do more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion, we have had four in-depth discussions, one of which lasted 50 minutes on Question Time. If there is a requirement to have further discussions, we can have them, but we have had a question and answer session on this matter on four occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government introduce a White Paper on education in light of a startling report indicating the need to devolve power within the Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>As I am wearing my red tie, will the Taoiseach indicate when Santa Claus is likely to arrive in the form of the budget? On what date will the budget be introduced? The date may have been given previously? There is talk of Santa Claus arriving in the shops. Will he arrive in the Dáil soon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, three weeks ago the Taoiseach told us the Cabinet had cleared the amendments to the Children Bill. If that is the case, why have those amendments not been circulated and when are we likely to get them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr Shatter Mr Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context, will the Taoiseach indicate by what date the Government will be willing to take Committee Stage of the Children Bill? Will he tell the Minister of State to stop misleading the public by pretending the Bill is being debated in committee as she has continuously done in a series of interviews in recent months?   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same issue, in view of the disturbing evidence presented yesterday by Focus Ireland at a meeting of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights regarding the high incidence of homelessness among children who have left care and its request that amending legislation be introduced to ensure there is responsibility taken for these young people when they leave care, will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government intends to bring forward any legislation to deal with this situation, which is shocking in that up to 60% of such children end up being homeless?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the questions put by Deputy Shortall and the other Deputies, the amendments to the Children Bill have been drafted by the parliamentary counsel and are with the Bills Office. I am informed by the Department that we have instructed the Bills Office to arrange for the publication of the amendments as soon as possible, which should be later this week. The Minister of State's responsibility in this area covers the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister of State will be ready to take Committee Stage of the Bill within a week or two of the publication of the amendments. The timing of the taking of Committee Stage is in the hands of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The select committee has written to 20 interested parties and placed an advertisement in a newspaper seeking views on the Bill. It appears the select <Col N="785" /> committee intends to complete the consultative process before proceeding with Committee Stage of the Bill, although the Minister of State will be ready to take it within a fortnight.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>On promised legislation, given that a great amount of activity is taking place in telecommunications and there is an urgent need to update the regulatory procedures, why is there is a delay in bringing forward the telecommunications regulation Bill? Why has it not been given priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on the telecommunications regulation Bill is at an advanced stage in the Department. The heads of the Bill are expected to be ready in about two weeks' time, although the Bill will not be introduced until next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There was confusion last week about the need to hold a referendum to ratify the Rome statute on an international criminal court. The Taoiseach has since confirmed that he accepts a constitutional amendment must be introduced. Given that this was signed two and a half years ago, will the Taoiseach indicate when such a referendum will be held? He should accept that there is a great need for us to give a lead on this and not to further delay its ratification.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised with the Taoiseach a few weeks ago a matter relating to the town renewal Act, which was passed before the summer recess. Given that guidelines on it have not been issued to local authorities almost six months after the enactment of that legislation, it is not possible to implement it. Will the Taoiseach indicate when or if guidelines on it will be issued to local authorities to enable them to implement this legislation? The Minister for the Environment and Local Government might be able to assist him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>The consultation process on the adoption contact register Bill has been completed for many months, yet the projected date for its introduction is mid-2001. Will that date be revised, as there seems to be no reason its introduction should take so long?</P>
      <P>The consultation process on the disabilities Bill is ongoing at present. In light of the experience regarding this Bill, I am concerned that it may be a long time before it is introduced. Will the Taoiseach indicate when he expects the disabilities Bill will be introduced, particularly given that a number of issues have arisen recently that indicate the urgent need to introduce legislation that will guarantee the rights of people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The heads of the adoption contact register Bill and the disabilities Bill are expected to be cleared prior to Christmas. The adoption contract register Bill will be ready nearer to the summer session. Work on the disabilities Bill is in progress. That Bill will provide a legislative basis to advance and underpin the participation of people with disabilities. I am informed that it will be a longer time before work on that legislation is complete. It will not be ready until the second half of next year.</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about a Government proposal that we would debate a report which the Minister for Health and Children has had for some time, where children were used as guinea pigs for vaccines because they happened to be in care. I understand the report has not yet been furnished to the Opposition or published, yet the House is supposed to debate it tomorrow. When will the report be published? Can the Taoiseach assure the House it will be debated without a time limit applying and on the basis of a Government motion, which is open to amendment, rather than simply by means of statements, which allow no policy discussion to take place on any definite issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Copies of the report will be given to the spokespersons today. The report will be officially published tomorrow. I was asked on yesterday's Order of Business to ensure that the spokespersons receive the report today. I understand they will. The Minister for Health and Children is prepared to table a motion on Tuesday next, subject to arrangements with Whips, to refer the report to a committee for discussion. It is the Minister's intention to proceed as planned by laying the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas tomorrow followed by statements tomorrow. In his speech he will signal his intention to refer the report immediately to the Laffoy commission, as he deems it the most appropriately equipped forum to deal with any issues that may arise from the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael is opposed to this report being referred to the Laffoy commission. We feel this needs to be dealt with urgently and separately. The Laffoy commission should not be used as a dumping ground for issues the Government finds too hot to handle itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That commission has enough to do in dealing other aspects of children in care without having to deal with this issue separately. Will the Taoiseach assure the House that this report will be published in full and not just given to spokespersons and that the debate will not take place until such time as all Members have had an adequate opportunity to study it? It is not an adequate way to treat this House to ask Members to debate a report most of them will not have seen until the morning of the debate.</P>

However, the Minister and the Government feel the correct thing to do is to give it immediately to the Laffoy commission, which he deems the most appropriate place to investigate issues which date back to 1960 and 1961.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;development by a local authority or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 15 of the Bill, which is an interpretation section and we are dealing here with the definition of &ldquo;works&rdquo;. The Bill as drafted reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;works&rdquo; includes any activity which destroys or which significantly alters, damages or interferes with the integrity of&ndash;</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;a) a site, or</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;b) any of its species, communities or habitats,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>either intentionally or unintentionally, or any activity which has a significant impact on the <Col N="790" /> site or on any of its species, communities or habitats or on its landforms or geological or geomorphological features, or on its diversity or natural attributes, other than development by a local authority . . .</P>
    <P>We dealt with this amendment at some length on Committee Stage and the Minister pointed out that the local authority was also the planning authority, so that in essence this situation was covered. I put it to the Minister that whereas part of a local authority's function is as a planning authority, there are other functions carried out by local authorities which could impinge on the integrity on NHAs and could cause problems or damage. For example, work carried out adjacent to an NHA could interfere, for instance, with the watercourses linked to the NHA.</P>
    <P>The definition here also alludes to exempted development under the Planning and Development Act, which is also excluded from the definition of works. I feel the Minister had not quite looked at the whole context before Committee Stage. Whereas one function of the local authority relates to the development plan, which must take cognisance of NHAs and NHA orders, and the Minister introduced an amendment on Committee Stage which extended this to designated or notified NHAs, there is still a danger that works could be carried out by a local authority, perhaps in an emergency or in a situation where speed was required. The Minister is surrendering an element of control in this section and that is not in the best interests of protecting NHAs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The Minister will be aware of many local authorities throughout the country which, due to various pressures that have been placed on them, have taken action without, perhaps, the full support of certain sections of their own organisations. If the Minister is intent on giving a special exemption to local authorities, she must make it clear that she is giving that exemption to certain sections of local authorities which may not have the expertise to deal with or interest in the conservation issues for which she is responsible.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reflect carefully on this matter and to take on board the spirit of Deputy O'Shea's amendment. Local authority officials are secretly frustrated by the actions of some of their colleagues, particularly those who work in roads departments, for example, who may not have been trained to deal with or be interested enough in the conservation issues that may be at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before discussing the amendment in detail it is necessary to outline the general framework provided for natural heritage areas in the Bill. I wish to underline that strong and permanent protection is being provided for NHAs. The Bill provides for the designation and conservation of natural heritage areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NHAs are sites that support elements of our <Col N="791" /> natural heritage which are unique or of outstanding importance at national level. Such areas can never be adequately replaced and their conservation is required in the interests of the common good. A legal framework for their designation and conservation is long overdue and this Bill remedies that deficiency.</P>
    <P>I take considerable satisfaction from the fact that the provisions I have put in place in respect of NHAs in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill will ensure their permanent protection. Not only does the Bill provide for the protection of NHAs, it does so in a fair and open manner which rules out any need for anxiety or fear among farmers or other landowners regarding the ownership of their land.</P>
    <P>I have indicated previously &ndash; and it is worth repeating &ndash; that I am revising fundamentally the protective regime that will apply to NHAs. Prior to my assuming office, NHAs in general could only be guaranteed what amounted to essentially temporary protection. If, after a period of six months, a person wished to proceed with damaging works in an NHA, there was no mechanism to prevent them doing so, with the exception of the possibility of a compulsory purchase.</P>
    <P>Apart from the social, political and practical undesirability and the impossibility of guaranteeing protections for NHAs by compulsory purchase, it would be a wholly inappropriate approach to conserving biodiversity in the modern era. The idea that ecologically important sites should be protected through compulsory State purchase, thus essentially ring-fencing them and ruling out all other uses or activities in such areas, would be ill-advised. It would be a recipe to pit conservation and other interests in direct conflict with each other and to bring about and perpetuate a divisive and damaging relationship.</P>
    <P>I have introduced a system which guarantees that the ecological interests of NHAs can be protected permanently. Works in NHAs will require the consent of the Minister and any activities which will cause significant damage can be prohibited permanently. By ensuring that the ecological interests of NHAs can be safeguarded through this mechanism, I have also been able to dispense with the need to compulsorily purchase land to conserve wildlife.</P>
    <P>To balance the imposition of permanent restrictions, it was fair and proper to provide that compensation would be paid to landowners in cases where they suffered real losses as a result of NHA designation. Apart from many constitutional considerations, it is right to compensate farmers or to provide them with financial incentives for maintaining or delivering biodiversity services.</P>
    <P>While some archaeological practices can damage wildlife, it must be underlined that many of the areas we now view as being of particular ecological importance were created by traditional agriculture. Appropriate agricultural practices must continue in order to maintain the biodivers<Col N="792" /> ity importance of these areas. Consequently, it is not only fair but essential to provide supports for sustainable agriculture in such areas as we are doing via REPS in NHAs.</P>
    <P>I have always recognised that sustainable agriculture delivers wildlife benefits. I am glad the EU now concurs with my thinking, as reflected in its embracing of the concept of multifunctionality of agriculture. This is the terminology coined to recognise and support the delivery by agriculture of biodiversity and environmental benefits. In short, providing permanent protection for a network of nationally important wildlife sites, NHAs, in a fair and equitable manner constitutes a change of fundamental importance in the approach adopted in this country to the conservation of natural heritage.</P>
    <P>I am aware that on Committee Stage concern was expressed in relation to the fact that local authority development or development that is not exempted for the purposes of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, within an NHA might not be subject to a sufficient degree of regulation under section 15 of the Bill as drafted. I take this opportunity to allay any such fears on the part of Deputies and I wish to clarify the protection afforded to NHAs under legislation in the above instances.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of section 15 of the Bill is to define works for the purposes of Chapter ll of the Act and not to regulate the activities of local authorities of local authorities. That matter is dealt with comprehensively under section 24 of the Bill in conjunction with section 12 of the principal Act, as well as in relevant planning legislation and regulations. I should also point out that the planning system is a separate regulatory system from that outlined in wildlife legislation. Therefore, it is important that excessive duplication of legislation across streams should be avoided.</P>
    <P>In the case of NHAs, I am pleased to confirm that their protection is specifically provided for in planning legislation and this protection serves to bolster yet complement the provisions of the Bill. I appreciate how the apparent exclusion of local authority development and exempted development might, at first glance, be interpreted as a <i>carte blanche</i> for local authorities to carry out works as they wish within NHAs. When this question is examined in further detail, however, it is clear that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I wish to explain the legislative provisions and mechanisms that are in place to ensure that local authority development and development which is not exempted development within NHAs is controlled. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, places NHAs on a statutory footing for the first time. Thus, literally, the Planning Act could not specifically refer to NHAs. Nonetheless, section 10(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Planning Act, 2000, provides that any county development plan prepared by a local authority shall include mandatory objectives for &ldquo;the conservation and protection of the environment including, in particular, the archaeological and natural heritage and the con<Col N="793" /> servation and protection of European sites and any other sites which may be prescribed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed between my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government that the protection of NHAs should be a mandatory objective of local authorities in their development plans. NHAs will fall into the category of sites which may be prescribed. Section 178 of the Planning Act, 2000, states that no development may be undertaken that would materially contravene a development plan. Thus, section 178, when taken in tandem with section 10(2)(<i>c</i>) of the same Act, entails specific and mandatory protection for NHAs.</P>
    <P>In addition, under section 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 1994, which remain in force, there is a specific requirement for local authorities to send a notice to my Department in respect of proposed developments affecting sites of geological, scientific or nature conservation interest. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has assured me that any similar regulations to be introduced as a consequence of the Planning Act, 2000, will provide specifically for consultation with my Department in respect of developments within NHAs. To embrace even further the protection of NHAs, section 24 will place an obligation on local authorities to consult me in respect of anything which may interfere with either a proposed or designated NHA, nature reserve or refuge.</P>
    <P>In the course of drafting the Bill and on heritage matters generally, there has been extensive consultation between my officials and their counterparts in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is very clear that the latter Department is fully aware of the responsibilities of local authorities in relation to NHAs and their protection and conservation, in consultation with my Department, will be a key factor in the future development of each county. I am sure Deputies will agree that, overall, this represents a comprehensive package of protection measures for NHAs.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to avoid unnecessary and unwieldly duplication of protection measures between the separate planning and wildlife protection legislative streams. Section 24, when taken with existing planning safeguards, results in a well balanced complementary package which will ensure NHAs are well protected. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister outlined the protection measures available for NHAs and the obligation on local authorities to consult her. That being the case, why is it necessary to exempt works undertaken by local authorities? What works does the Minister have in mind? While planning permission is required for certain works under the planning Acts, it is not required for others. If the Minister is happy that there are sufficient procedures and protection measures in place, why not leave things as they are? I had a discussion with her recently about the protection afforded in <Col N="794" /> a particular area in Killarney. While there probably was notification, there was a question about the works undertaken by the local authority. Is there a need to exempt works undertaken by local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not satisfied with the Minister's explanation. Under section 15 &ldquo;works&rdquo; include any activity which destroys or significantly alters, damages or interferes with the integrity of a site or any of its species, communities or habitats. On Committee Stage the Minister stated that under section 24 local authorities will be obliged to consult her regarding any works which could affect a designated NHA and to take steps to avoid damage to NHAs. It is a judgment call. Who will decide whether the Minister should be consulted? Currently, there is much flooding in urban and rural areas, which local authorities are taking urgent action to relieve. There may be a number of options. While I accept local authorities must be able to act, the fact that works undertaken by them will be exempt under the Bill means that there may not be sufficient control in the selection of the proper options which would produce similar results to ensure NHAs are protected and that we meet our conservation objectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 15, does the Minister have at her disposal a matrix or database of notifiable works? Has she made her views on this matter known to the local authorities that they should provide for the protection of natural heritage areas and habitats in their development plans? It is my experience that in many cases they are rowing back on their references to conservation. The Minister has a responsibility to reverse this trend. For example, hedgerows have been omitted from the Fingal County Council development plan. Local authorities have their hands full in flood relief and progressing roads projects under the national development plan with the result that conservation issues are not a priority for them. They are not living up to the dreams and aspirations which the Minister has for them and to which she referred in glowing terms. By exempting works undertaken by them, we are playing into their hands. I urge the Minister to think again to ensure they do the work that is her responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of my concerns in this area. My primary concern is enforcement. Insufficient personnel are available to oversee the implementation of this type of legislation and the point at issue in the amendment in particular. It was reported in the newspapers last week that the Builders' Association of Ireland had requested that retired planners be re-employed by the local authorities. Planners are so overrun by the number of applications for planning permission that they cannot keep up with the volume of work. How can they have time to look into matters such as this, unless there are suf<Col N="795" /> ficient staff? There are insufficient staff available, whether it be engineers, geologists, archaeologists or wildlife rangers, to ensure the work involved is done properly. The Minister mentioned that 90 wildlife rangers have been employed in the last two years, but there is no evidence of this on the ground.</P>
      <P>The Minister should establish an independent body to ensure our heritage is properly preserved. While Dúchas is doing a worthwhile job, as it is under the aegis of the Department it can hardly be objective. We are all terrified and extraordinarily worried when we read continually in the newspapers that we are in breach of laws introduced by the European Union, but not being implemented here. This publicity about the destruction of our heritage has grown in the last three or four years. I do not know the reason, but I read in a newspaper over the weekend that the Minister has not attended a meeting of the Cultural Council for at least two years. Is this due to her pique at the criticism on the part of the European Union of our inability to police the archaeological sites in this country and the type of activity to which Deputy O'Shea referred or is it simply due to a lack of interest?</P>

      <P>I want to state clearly that there is already planning legislation on the Statute Book and it would not be advisable for my Department to duplicate that. We are working in tandem with that legislation. Local authorities will work to the Department of the Environment and Local Government which, in turn, will have direct access to my Department. Indeed, local authorities can obtain expert information from my Department on this matter. It is not a question of letting local authorities off the hook. I provided a comprehensive reply in which I outlined how these matters have been brought together in a very substantial package which will protect the NHAs on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to arterial drainage, an issue which can be discussed in regard to later amendments. Deputy Sargent referred to my aspirations for the operation of local authorities. We are talking about the Planning Act, 2000, which is far from aspirational. It is not for me, in any capacity, to deal with or monitor the workings of local authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the Building Association of Ireland. Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the association on drawing up codes of practice. We have also held very extensive discussions with the NRA which resulted in the production of a very useful code of practice which other bodies and associations will be able to use. My Department has recently appointed more archaeologists and the number of wildlife rangers has also multiplied.</P>

      <P>I have not received a satisfactory answer to the basic point I raise in this amendment. Why should local authority development be excluded from the definition of &ldquo;works&rdquo; for the purposes of NHAs? The definition of &ldquo;works&rdquo; is a negative one which refers to activities which destroy, alter, damage or interfere with the integrity of a site or its communities or habitats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 24 and spoke about consultation between her and local auth<Col N="797" /> orities on works which could affect a designated NHA in order that steps could be taken to avoid damage. That is expanded on by the Minister's amendment to notified NHAs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised an important point in regard to staffing levels at Dúchas and local authorities. The consultation process in section 24 involves a judgment call. Who, within a local authority, will decide that certain works could interfere with or damage an NHA? What mechanisms are in place to make such decisions? The use of the word &ldquo;could&rdquo; means the definition is not a very tight one. Who is responsible at local authority level for deciding what should be communicated to the Minister?</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of day to day engineering work at local authority level and the possibility exists that certain work, particularly that involving digging, could result in the serious disruption of water courses, thereby causing flooding and damage to habitats. I do not see any justification whatsoever for local authorities to be exempted from the same rigours as other bodies in regard to works carried out on NHAs. The definition is far too loose.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the planning legislation but I remain unconvinced that this provision is watertight in terms of local authority activities. The planning function of local authorities is separate from their other functions. Adjudication on planning Acts and the development plan is an independent function of the planning authority. It is not simply a matter of viewing a local authority as an entity. Local authorities have autonomy in regard to planning but I do not see why their other functions should be exempted from this definition of &ldquo;works&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 36, after &ldquo;area.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Any person may notify the Minister in writing of his or her wish to have a particular site or sites designated as a natural heritage area. The Minister, having received such a letter, shall cause an assessment to be made of the site having regard to <i>subsection (6)(a)</i>. Where the Minister is of the opinion, having regard to <i>subsection (6)(a)</i>, that the land forms, or is part of a natural heritage area, the Minister shall inform the proposer of the site of his or her intention to make an order designating the land as a natural heritage area.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to an issue discussed on Committee Stage, namely the possibility of a member of the public or a conservation body-<Col N="798" /> being entitled to notify or facilitated in notifying the Minister in writing of their wish to have a particular site or sites designated as NHAs. This is a serious issue and I remain to be convinced that the Minister welcomes the input from NGOs in this matter, although I know she has had consultations in the preparation of the Bill and that there is communication with them. However, the current provision is a top down procedure in terms of designation, involving the Department in effect taking a liking to a site and then the local community having to be informed, getting used to the idea and hopefully accepting it. For genuine and effective conservation it is important that as much opportunity as possible is given to local communities and people interested in conservation to bring forward ideas.</P>

      <P>Apart from providing some framework within which a person can bring to the Minister a clear request to have an area designated as an NHA, with an accompanying map delineating the site and data detailing conservation status, etc., there is an obligation on local and national Government to encourage the principles under which Agenda 21 was agreed at the Earth Summit, which include encouraging local participation and initiative in areas of conservation and sustainability. In addition, the principles of subsidiarity suggest that local involvement and initiative should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said any person can write to her at any time, and that she would welcome that, but that is not explicit in the Bill. It is important to redress the balance as it is explicitly stated that the Minister knows best, is in charge and therefore will ultimately decide whether an area is an NHA. I agree with this, but it should not exclude the involvement of the community, local interests and conservation bodies from making suggestions and requests in terms of areas which should be NHAs.</P>
      <P>I believe everybody on this side of the House would reiterate what Deputy Deasy said. Obviously there is a need to make effective use of resources as they are apparently scarce in the Minister's Department &ndash; other Departments talk about having resources to spare and the revenue from the Celtic tiger giving them many options. Ultimately we need more staff working in conservation and if people, be they NGOs, local communities or individuals with an interest in conservation, are prepared to be involved they should be encouraged and that should be explicit in the Bill.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage we discussed this issue and the Minister was concerned that there could be too many applications which would clog up the system. She was also concerned about vexatious applications made by people who <Col N="799" /> had no real interest in conservation. I tried to frame an amendment whereby third parties or those with an interest in establishing an NHA would have a procedure under which they could make an application to the Minister and Dúchas to include an area as an NHA. I have tried to frame it so that people with an interest and knowledge in conservation would have to produce a scientific plan, that it would not be a case of them writing a standard letter requesting that an area be included. Their application would have to be substantial and address the issue in a serious manner. In this way my amendment tries to address some of the Minister's concerns about vexatious or anti-development applications.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said third parties were welcome to write to her and that she would receive their applications. That is fine now, but there will be a change of ministry and if such a procedure is not established in legislation it will be lost forever. I accept the Minister's good intentions, but it is important that the Bill includes a provision whereby third parties could have a procedure that would allow them propose an area to be designated as an NHA. I am not saying the third parties should make the decision &ndash; Dúchas will process the applications and the Minister will have the final decision on whether a site should be an NHA.</P>
      <P>There is much expertise in the country and we have already discussed staffing levels and how difficult it is for all Departments to recruit staff, particularly at local authority level and in areas for which the Minister is responsible. There are people working in the area who have an interest in conservation and to use their information would be practical and worthwhile. Ultimately the Minister would have to make the final decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>This issue was debated on Committee Stage. At that time I stated I had representations on this issue but that having considered it at some length I decided it was best not to pursue it. However, the point made by Deputy Sargent about the engagement or involvement of the population at large in conservation issues is a laudable objective and one we should all seek to develop.</P>
      <P>My greatest concern at the end of the day is the lack of staff. Letters will be sent to the Minister on designating sites as NHAs, some of which could be mischievous and self-seeking and there must be a way of filtering out such letters. Deputy Clune's amendment uses the words &ldquo;why the site is of special scientific interest&rdquo;. I may have a house on a piece of land, want to prevent development adjacent to it and decide to nominate my neighbour's land as an NHA, which would be self-seeking. However, having said that, I support the genuine general involvement of people in conservation issues. People should become conscious of our wildlife, flora and fauna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more knowledge in the community the more conservation will be effected, if an effective <Col N="800" /> filtering system can be put in place, whereby the unworthy or useless letters can be separated from applications made by NGOs of standing and from people with specialised knowledge in the areas to which the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill applies and also from those who genuinely put a reasonable scientific base to their proposal. An input from those people should be welcomed. This does not solve the basic dilemma. Given the scarce resources available to the Minister I am concerned that a significant amount of the time of her staff could be given over to examining applications and carrying out assessments on applications that had nothing to offer. Having listened to my colleagues and having read their amendments I believe a balance can be struck where some screening process can be put in place. It could probably be based on the terminology in Deputy Clune's amendment where the special scientific interest would have to be stated. In the absence of some such basis to letters, those letters would not go beyond being read and put to one side. On the other hand if I recall correctly the Minister said on Committee Stage that if correspondence arrived on her desk that had value and merit it would not be ignored. I accept the Minister's bone fides and her good intentions but we are legislating to put together a process whereby we can welcome engagement from people of goodwill and those who are coming forward with worthwhile proposals. It is important that people relate to Dúchas and develop an understanding of legislation and an understanding of the importance of sites, habitats and their communities etc. I urge the Minister to look seriously at the two amendments. In her response perhaps she will give an indication as to how the aspirations that give rise to these amendments can be adequately met, not only in the context of assessing NHAs but in welcoming people to engage in the whole process of conservation, thereby improving in a way that is difficult to measure, the protection of NHAs because of a wider base and informed public awareness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard many Members speak about staff and the lack of staff to police the various aspects of this legislation. When speaking about communications between NGOs and landowners to the Minister's Department is it realistic to expect ordinary folk, landowners and members of the public to accept a reply from Dúchas in Latin? I know of a person who asked the Department, through Dúchas, for scientific evidence of the basis on which a decision had been taken in the past by the Department and received an eight page reply of Latin terms naming species. The person was frustrated and said there was no point in dealing any further with the matter and felt it was a fob off by Dúchas. Will the Minister ensure, where requests are made to her Department for information that the reply will never again be through copious leaves and leaves of names of species in Latin. If one wants to kill communication that is one way of doing it. <Col N="801" /> My first reaction was that this person was being told to get lost. That is not a helpful way for any statutory body to deal with a genuine concern in respect of entitlements or information. It is unfair given that the Minister will accept scientific evidence only in certain appeals. For example, where ordinary folk are trying to appeal they are compelled to bring scientific evidence only. That is beyond the reach of an ordinary landowner whose lands are designated.</P>
      <P>In the past the whole process in regard to the notification procedure has been found to be totally unsatisfactory. There were people, for whatever reason, who were not aware their lands were designated until some other coincidental event had arisen. Has the Minister got the staff and the wherewithal to notify landowners other than through notification on the local media? There is an onus on her to tell every landowner in a focused way that his or her land has been designated. That has not been the case in the past . We have precedents to back my statement that people have not been told. When it was pointed out to it, Dúchas said there was nothing it could do. Dúchas has fought strenuously in every way possible to adhere to its decision and that was it. In regard to the appeal mechanism, it was taken for granted that land owners had been notified when that was not the case. I agree with the amendments on the basis that that is an unsatisfactory way to deal with the matter. On the one hand we can have notification by NGOs who have a genuine interest in the inclusion of certain areas for designation and at the same time they are not recognised in a legislative way. It is not adequate in this day and age to deal with them on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>

      <P>A number of points have been made. With regard to the whole question of discussion and being open to consultation and meeting with groups, before and since the publication of the Bill there has been unprecedented consultation with NGOs, other groups and individuals by me and my officials. That is how I have always tried to approach my work not only in this area of my responsibilities but in the running of the Department. I am glad that under my stewardship over recent years we have increased staffing in certain areas, particularly among archaeologists and rangers. I would like to make more appointments because there is a tremendous amount of work to be undertaken. I welcome, as does every Member, genuine involvement of local groups because that is important. I encourage people to contact the Department regarding any matter under its remit, not just the issues under discussion today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sargent suggested a Minister could take a liking to designation of certain sites. As the Deputy will be aware, designation will be made on scientific grounds. I understand what the Deputies had in mind when drafting these amendments, but we must be practical and recognise that in some instances vexatious elements <Col N="802" /> could come to light if third party input was put on a statutory footing. This is not the way forward. I encourage groups and individuals to contact my Department to put forward their suggestions.</P>
    <P>It is not a question, as Deputy Clune said, of informing the Department by way of standard letter. The sites will be inspected and decisions made in an appropriate and scientific manner. We would encourage at all levels the involvement of local expertise and interests in that process. For the reasons I stated earlier and on Committee Stage regarding the general approach to this process, I do not believe putting third party input in the designation process on a statutory footing is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I thank Members who said they realise I want consultation and to encourage people to contact the Department, but, as has been correctly pointed out, we must look to other Administrations to ensure the legislation we enact is appropriate. We are referring to the responsibility of the Minister for heritage and I hope the Minister of the day from whatever Administration with responsibility in this area will be aware of his or her obligations and responsibilities in this regard and carry out his or her work in an efficient manner. While I acknowledge the goodwill behind this proposal, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to refer to the irony of the Minister's defence of her position. I take her point that there was consultation during the preparation of the Bill but the amendments were tabled as a direct result of requests from NGOs involved in conservation and, therefore, it is not a case of us trying to represent anybody with a vexatious agenda. We followed up on requests from people involved in conservation whose only interest was in the scientific grounds provision, which the Minister is correct in saying will be the criterion on which a request will be judged.</P>
      <P>However, I would resist any pressure to generalise the grounds on which an NHA is considered because it would be impossible to be objective about it and it leaves the way open for local feuding or preferences on the basis of criteria other than scientific grounds. I am clear, as are the NGOs, that requests should be judged on scientific grounds. I hope that will rule out vexatious approaches which have been mooted as a possibility if an amendment such as mine is accepted.</P>
      <P>The Minister is standing firm on this issue. If she intends to put her foot down and say &ldquo;thus far and no further&rdquo; I urge her to make it clear to NGOs that the door is not closed on consultation. Recognising there is a shortage of resources does the Minister appreciate the expertise, offers and requests from NGOs so that there will be a growing dialogue between NGOs and the Department in the interest of conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister will not advance the issue. I recognised her concerns <Col N="803" /> on Committee Stage and I tried to go some way towards meeting them through my amendment to try to eliminate the vexatious applications that would occur. There has been much debate about lack of staff and clogging the system because there is not enough staff to process these requests. Staffing should not influence the legislation. People with expertise, concerns and interest who have a valuable and worthwhile contribution to make are available and procedures should be provided in the legislation for them to submit applications.</P>
      <P>However, I am glad the Minister is continuing to consult with and keeping the door open for third parties and NGOs which have a contribution to make. I am disappointed that we cannot reach a compromise or meet halfway on this issue. NGOs also have a great deal to offer in the environment field in terms of expertise. Nobody has a monopoly on information. The NGOs and others working in the area should be aware of the Minister's openness and willingness to participate in consultation with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that she will not accept the amendments. However, before the Bill reaches the Seanad perhaps she will again examine the fundamental issue involved. A limited number of sites could be credibly proposed as NHAs. If there was a provision for writing to the Minister and carrying out assessments the number of such proposals being made to the Minister would diminish over time. The fundamental issue is inviting consultation and ensuring NGOs and people with expertise on the one hand are very much part of the process. That is not to undervalue in any way the other important process of cultivating involvement with the Department and with Dúchas, as well as raising public awareness of conservation and advancing that agenda. If I am reading the Minister's view correctly, she will not concede anything on these amendments. Will she re-examine this question, however, in the context of the Seanad debate, to see if there is some way in which the legitimate aspirations that have been expressed on this side of the House could be provided for? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In her reply, will the Minister deal with the question of notification? The Minister should also consider one other item related to the amendments. If we look at a map of Ireland containing the areas of designation, including NHAs, SACs and SPAs, it is clear that we are approaching saturation point. Western counties may even have gone beyond that point, particularly County Galway. As the Minister knows, vast areas of Connemara, south Galway, east Galway and the Shannon basin are all designated in some shape or form. I am asking the Minister if we have reached saturation point with regard to designations, or have we passed it? There is such a concentration of designated areas along the west<Col N="804" /> ern seaboard because of what has occurred in other parts of the country, including Meath, Wexford and other more highly developed regions. Everything has happened there so quickly that the situation has gone beyond redemption.</P>
      <P>The Minister and her Department need to recognise that we are at saturation point, if not past it. There is an urgent need to indicate to landowners what we will do in these heavily saturated counties if we are to continue on this basis because the situation will have serious repercussions later. I am not just knocking designation for the sake of doing so. I realise that its scientific basis is important, but such designations have serious social and economic implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke asked whether we have gone too far, and I believe we have. It is not good enough for people in Brussels and Dublin to tell people in the west what they should do. I tabled a parliamentary question to obtain a map of the designated areas. While I am open to correction on this point, I understand that Galway was No. 1, Mayo No. 2, and Kerry No. 3. I can see why people in the west are becoming angry, even if people in the rest of the country say we are always complaining. In recent days there was flooding in parts of Dublin and I offer my sympathy to those who suffered, but we have had such flooding in the west for the past ten years. We reached crisis point last Christmas when roads were impassable there, yet there was not a word about it.</P>
      <P>The NHAs and other designations have gone too far. There is consultation with officials but they are not listening. I predict that NHAs and SACs will provoke riots in the west and elsewhere over the next few years when people see further restrictions on what they can or cannot do with their lands. The position is reverting to the days of the landlords. We spent 50 years trying to get rid of them, yet now our own people and those in Europe are placing more restrictions on landowners in the west. In some western areas one cannot rear anything, yet people there cannot obtain planning permission for houses or do anything with their land any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are talking about enlarging the European Union, but if there was a referendum today I would support the Minister's views about the European Union because we are getting too much dictatorship from Brussels. This House does not count any more because all we are doing is rubber stamping regulations from Europe. It is a bit like what is happening with central Government which is dictating to people in rural areas what they should do with their property. We spent 50 years trying to get rid of the landlords, yet now we have the new European and Dublin landlords telling people what they can or cannot do with their land. I am sick and tired of it and so are many other people. They constitute a group that is becoming organised because they have had enough of this. They might talk to officials from the Office of Public Works and <Col N="805" /> Dúchas but those officials are not listening. For the sake of the Minister and the Department the officials go into meetings, but with blankets over their heads. They claim to have consultations but they are not listening and will not change the rules. I am sick and tired of hearing from poor men and women who apply for planning permission and are told by the county council: &ldquo;We have to send it off to Dúchas to see if they will object, and they may object because of this or that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>People in the west are organising themselves and this will be a major political issue over the next few years. I am tired of the dictat coming from Europe telling us what we should do. I would prefer to see the Government telling us what to do and helping us to do it. Everything is happening on the east coast at the moment, but there is nothing on the west coast. There are so many restrictions on the bit of land on the west coast that young people cannot live, farm, build or survive there. It is a step too far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies raised the question of third party proposals for designating certain sites, some of which may be vexatious. Full checks have to be done on any sites that are put forward for designation, however. While this could pose some practical difficulties, it proves that any issues put to my Department will be examined seriously and properly checked out before any decisions are made. I accept what Deputy Sargent said, that his amendment was not only tabled on foot of his views but also because NGOs feel strongly about the issue. I accept that because the NGOs have said so directly to me. I am pleased the Deputy recognises that I will not close the door on this matter. Like every other Member of the House, I would like to be able to utilise local expertise in addressing heritage matters on a community basis. I would not go along with the view that it should be done from the top down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Ulick Burke and Ring referred to designations, and SACs in particular. I am sure both Deputies will be aware that the Habitats Directive was decided upon by the previous Administration before I took office. It was only when I assumed my current responsibilities that I tried to examine the situation that had been imposed on us, to try to obtain a fairer system for landowners. That is why we have the appeals system and liaison committees which have been working well. Following a number of discussions, I have had feedback from NGOs as to how they and farming groups have been working extremely well on these committees. A number of people have contacted my Department in the hope that their land would be included in SACs. Deputies are correct in saying that a number of sites throughout the country have been designated as SACs. That number would be termed as average in the European context. It is no greater than the average number sent by other European states. There is the question of compensation because, under our Constitution, one could not impose <Col N="806" /> such restrictions without having compensation. That is why in a number of instances some people hope they will be included in the SAC system, whereas we are discussing the NHAs today, which is a different approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Minister is going as far as she can without allowing the amendment. However, like Deputy O'Shea, I ask her to think long and hard about it, with the Seanad in mind, in light of the views she has heard today. There is a way of sending out a clear message which is necessary for all stakeholders in this procedure. I take to heart what Deputy Ring said and identify with his feelings of disempowerment, as one would if one were a member of the Green Party faced with the larger parties, such as Deputy Ring's, which voted for the various progressions down the European road to the point at which we are now. It is important we take into account the changes which have taken place which have left us with irreversible decisions from Europe. Many are good but I agree that not all are.</P>
      <P>The east coast has many designated areas. I visited Clare, Galway and Roscommon to meet families affected by the flooding. I am sorry I did not get to County Mayo. This is a countrywide issue and I take the point that the west also has a case to answer. The Minister is in ways like a county manager. In a local authority, the county manager and the officials meet occasionally with deputations of people concerned about issues within the responsibility of the local authority or the Minister in this case. I hope a more formal facility is put in place. I do not want to be a drain on staff or resources but it could clear up a considerable amount of the logjams, angst, frustration and feelings of victimisation which seem to grow and fester in the absence of meaningful consultation and some type of structure on notification and consultation, as was mentioned by Deputy Ulick Burke.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would examine not just welcoming letters and all types of requests, but also a system whereby, if people want to meet her, a set structure is in place whereby a day is set aside every six months in which there are a number of slots in which to meet deputations and so on. It would be a case of joining the queue but a structure would be in place. It needs to be put on some type of formal basis so that there are not vexatious requests but meaningful consultation. That is the challenge we must get right. It seems we will not do so today, but I hope we will by the time the Bill gets to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 7, after &ldquo;impact.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The scientific advice referred to in <i>paragraph (a)</i> shall take account of the size of the site, its location, the type of natural feature or features contained in it, and linkages between them, the (degree of negative human impact) threats and present use impacts and the possibilities for site restoration.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 seeks to include, along with scientific advice, the size of the site, its location, the type of natural feature or features contained in it, the degree of negative human impact and the possibilities of site restoration. We discussed this on Committee Stage and it is important. It may already be taken into account. However, like the previous amendment, it is not explicit and it ought to be, especially for land owners.</P>
      <P>Experience has taught us that there is a view that the current state of a site is what is judged to have scientific merit or whatever. That leads people into the temptation to degrade a site before they are caught or before it becomes effectively protected. I say &ldquo;effectively protected&rdquo; because sites throughout the country are protected in name but, in reality, have little or no protection and the damage caused to them bears out that reality. Will the Minister take into account the degree to which a site can be restored as a factor to be considered when the scientific advice is being weighed up?</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say on the matter. We should examine the possibilities of site restoration as an aspect of the scientific advice criteria so that we would not encourage, by default or whatever, the destruction or damaging of sites in the hope that they may not be designated because they are sufficiently damaged to be deemed beyond repair. We should weigh up that aspect of site designation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>This proposal from Deputy Sargent requires that the NHA network should comprehend not only existing sites which are of special ecological importance but should be extended to include areas which potentially could be restored in future to be of ecological importance. This scenario would be a fundamental change and would go well beyond the concept envisaged all along for NHAs. There would be serious questions about the usefulness and advis<Col N="808" /> ability of such an approach, not to mention the major financial cost.</P>
      <P>The issue of exactly what framework should be elaborated to identify such areas and how to determine their possible scientific importance at the end of the day would not be easily resolved, if at all. The issue of where to draw the line in incorporating such sites into the NHA network would be a major consideration as the concept could be completely open-ended and lead to all sorts of demands. Furthermore, a core principle which always underlies the approach to NHAs and one to which there has been a long established commitment publicly is that land will only be proposed and designated for its scientific value.</P>
      <P>There would also be major practical problems. Issues would arise over whether it would even be possible to restore a specific site, whether the site should be restored, at what cost, what its final ecological value might be, etc. Difficulties would also be likely in regard to who would restore the land and who would pay for it. Such an amendment would also be fraught with legal difficulties. The Attorney General has already advised me that we cannot place certain burdens on land owners of proposed NHAs. Accordingly, it would probably be possible to place a burden on a land owner of a site that is not even suitable in its current condition for proposal as an NHA. As I stated on Committee Stage, we will be doing a great job if we protect what we have without diverting energies and money to restoring sites to their status of earlier years, thus defusing the overall effort and leading to a less satisfactory overall outcome.</P>

      <P>The motivation the Minister is reading into the amendment is slightly mischievous because it goes beyond the intended scope of the amendment. If it is mistakenly going beyond that scope, it should be curtailed so that it will not be interpreted as meaning, as I said on Committee Stage, a request for the Halls of Tara in royal Meath to be restored to their former glory. That would, obviously, be unrealistic and quite fanciful. Perhaps, someday someone will present a proposal in that regard but I have not seen one so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is aimed at a current reality, which is the destruction of sites that have been formally or informally notified to landowners as being designated. In the absence of adequate enforcement and protection, damage has been done to some sites in the belief that designation may be removed if the site is damaged and it will no longer be of the same value. I want to avoid that happening, as I know the Minister does. However, my attempts to avoid that happening are being read as an amendment intended to carry out something which is not actually in my mind. I want to seek some remedy for what is happening in reality, which is the destruction of those sites. That is the sole motivation for the amendment. If the Minister can assure me that <Col N="809" /> sites will not be destroyed in future, I will be delighted.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, I can seek the restoration of designated sites when the damage took place after designation. I can also seek restoration of a site damaged when it was a notified site, only after it has been subsequently designated. While I understand the Deputy's concern, he has to accept that his amendment not only would pose practical problems but, as I outlined earlier, would be fraught with legal difficulties. The Attorney General has advised me all through this Bill that we cannot place certain burdens on landowners of proposed NHAs that would not be seen to be reasonable.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the amendment could be seen as undermining what we are trying to do and as being a fundamental change in the concept envisaged all along of what we are doing here for the NHAs. The Deputy is aware we are looking for permanent protection for the NHAs. We have a number of ways of ensuring that is done. There is a legal and moral obligation to provide compensation for landowners. We want to encourage people to realise the importance of the NHAs. However, while I understand the motive behind the amendment is very genuine, it goes far beyond what we have envisaged in the legislation for natural heritage areas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 30, after &ldquo;measures&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including management plans&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with natural heritage area orders. The section states that &ldquo;such provisions as the Minister thinks fit which relate to protective measures&rdquo; can be included in the NHA order. I am seeking to go somewhat further than that by having the order include management plans.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed us on Committee Stage that the current drafting does not preclude her from including management plans if she so desires. However, a strategic approach should be put in place in relation to NHAs, although that is more important for some than others. If a management plan is part of the NHA order, it will be a matter of public record. For example, the NGOs would know in a very detailed way how the Minister wanted a particular NHA managed in her order. The NGOs would be able to informally monitor what was happening. If difficulties arose which were not brought to the Minister's attention, the level of detailed information available would mean the NGOs, for example, could alert the Department to deviations from the management plan, as contained in the NHA order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the more general point of public interest. If the specific details of a management plan were contained in an NHA order as a matter of public record, it would be scrutinised by the public and younger people would become <Col N="810" /> interested in the NHAs in their areas. They could get information on the reason a particular site was designated and the scientific material which made that site appropriate for designation. They could also see how the Minister and the Department would seek to put into effect the conservation of the NHA.</P>
    <P>This is about transparency, dissemination of information and encouraging engagement and involvement. The proposal in the amendment can only be for the good, in terms of the objective we all share, which is conservation of our heritage to the very best effect.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the reasoning behind Deputy O'Shea's amendment, it seems very worthwhile to have open procedures in place for management plans, so that we can follow step by step the reasoning for a decision relating to an NHA. It seems very worthwhile to have such a system in place to facilitate the public and others in understanding the workings of NHAs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, it would not be proper to specifically refer to management plans in this section, as proposed by Deputy O'Shea. An NHA order may include whatever provisions are required in order to provide for the conservation of sites, including stipulations concerning the management of the site. Furthermore, in addition to management plans there are various other types of plans or protective measures which could well be relevant to the conservation of an NHA. Examples include habitat conservation guidelines, commonage framework plans, individual farm plans and agriculture zoning plans. It would not be appropriate or necessary to detail all of these in primary legislation. One danger of detailing such a list is that the validity of employing a measure not included in the list could be called into question. Additionally, it is possible that further types of conservation measures which are not in existence at present could be devised at a future date. Therefore, I cannot agree to include a reference to management plans as sought by Deputy O'Shea. To do so is not only unnecessary but could ultimately weaken the protection afforded to NHAs by limiting the range of conservation measures the Minister could employ to ensure the conservation of NHAs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister. What I am seeking is that the order, which would be a statutory document and one of public record, would contain the widest possible information. The more information that is available in the statutory document the better for the conservation objective. The order is one matter but the amount of information given is another. I want to ensure that the maximum amount of information is made available and that there is the widest possible engagement and involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be happy if the Minister would look at this in the context of the debate in the Seanad. I <Col N="811" /> realise she wishes to avoid onerous procedures and approaches but the Bill states the order may include such measures as the Minister thinks fit. That should be firmed up because, as I read it, the order could be a very skimpy document. While that would satisfy the legal aspect it is the educational aspect that is vital.</P>

      <P>In page 20, line 2, after &ldquo;land&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or where the Minister has issued a notice in accordance with section 16, and where a decision under section 17 or 18 has not yet been made&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment in an effort to have improved protection for NHAs, particularly those that have been notified or proposed. This was discussed on Committee Stage and the Minister proposed amendments that went some way towards addressing the matter. However, I am concerned that after the three months, there is a time span during which the NHA will not be protected. It could take up to six months or longer. From the time SACs are proposed they are protected and I wish to ensure the same applies to NHAs. The Minister addressed this when speaking to Deputy Sargent's amendment. I do not believe it would place an undue burden or restriction on the landowner. If we deem it worthwhile to propose an area as an NHA it should be deemed to have protection until such time as it can be established as an NHA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined that I brought forward, under this Bill, a revised system for NHAs which will ensure their permanent protection in a balanced, fair and open manner. Deputy Clune's proposal concerns the issue of protection for notified as opposed to designated NHAs which was raised by other Deputies on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the consultation process that I put in place on publication of the Bill a number of conservation NGOs, while welcoming the overall approach on NHAs, also raised concerns over potential damage to NHAs during the notification stage. I recognise that the interim between notification and designation is potentially dangerous. While I believe the vast majority of farmers and other landowners would not set out to damage NHAs I am conscious proposed NHAs could be open to damage by unscrupulous individuals during the notification stage. In recognition of these concerns, I devised a package of amendments aimed at ensuring that damage to notified NHAs can be prevented. I believe these improvements, which I introduced on Committee Stage, will secure my overall objective which is to have a system for NHAs that guarantee their permanent protection in a fair and balanced way while elimi<Col N="812" /> nating the need for compulsory purchase. Specifically on section 19 I introduced an amendment which will require that on a notified NHA a person shall not carry out any potentially damaging works without first giving three months' notice to the Minister. Proceeding with works without giving such notification could constitute an offence. These provisions should be considered together with section 20 of the Bill which enables me to apply to the courts to seek the prohibition of such works.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I introduced an amendment strengthening section 21 so that I will be able to order the restoration of a site damaged during the notification period when it is designated as a natural heritage area. Additionally, I introduced an amendment to section 24 so that the requirement placed on other Departments and certain public bodies, including planning authorities, to consult with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on any proposed works and avoid damage to important sites is being extended to cover notified NHAs in addition to designated NHAs.</P>
    <P>Section 50 places a similar obligation on the Commissioner of Public Works while undertaking drainage schemes. On foot of the concerns raised on Committee Stage regarding notified NHAs I further examined, including through thorough consultation with the Attorney General's office, whether protection for notified NHAs could be strengthened further. In particular, as promised, I raised Deputy Higgins' proposal, which I appreciate is being made with a view to improving the Bill, with the Attorney General. The clear advice is that restrictions are already imposed on a landowner of a notified NHA and that it is not possible to go beyond this. I reassure Deputies on the provisions for notified NHAs. Despite the amendments I introduced on Committee Stage some Deputies seem to believe that notified NHAs are being left without any safeguards and that such sites will be left open to wide scale destruction without any mechanism to prevent damaging works on them. This scenario is not the case. The Bill provides clearly that significant damaging works in notified national heritage areas can be prohibited.</P>
    <P>A person cannot carry out works without notifying the Minister three months in advance and the Minister can seek a court injunction to stop any works if they are thought likely to destroy or significantly damage the notified site. We can move within a relatively short period of time, three months, to protect a proposed NHA by designating it in the event it is considered appropriate to do so. Overall, these are reasonable and appropriate measures to ensure that notified NHAs can be protected without placing an onerous or unfair burden on the landowner.</P>
    <P>In light of the legal advice available to me, I have gone as far as possible in providing protection to notified NHAs. I am satisfied these <Col N="813" /> measures will adequately safeguard notified NHAs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 24, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the owner, occupier or user as the case may be has after the expiration of the said period of 6 months given the Minister 14 days' further notice of the intention to carry out or cause or permit to be carried out the works concerned and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from our discussions on Committee Stage. I was horrified at the prospect of somebody applying to carry out work on a NHA and, by default, having permission to proceed if the Minister did not respond within six months. We should guard against a default provision.</P>
      <P>Everybody is familiar with situations where there have been systems breakdowns in the planning process which resulted in something going ahead which should not have gone ahead. The amendment guards against that eventuality. I propose that when the six month period expires without the Minister responding there should be a further period of 14 days during which there would be an onus on the applicant to inform the Minister that no decision has been communicated to him or her within the six months. The Minister would have 14 days to respond. This is a reasonable way to address the issue. The doomsday scenario should not arise when the system breaks down somewhere and there is no response by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The amendment gives the Minister a second opportunity to respond but the response period is limited so there is no undue delay for the applicant, who obviously has rights with regard to responses. In the probably small number of instances where the system breaks down and there is no response, the amendment provides for a failsafe mechanism to protect the public interest in relation to our heritage.</P>

That could have dreadful consequences. I am anxious to hear the Minister's response to the amendment. Deputy O'Shea is attempting to provide for a failsafe mechanism to avoid a situation arising where, when the six month date passes without a communication from the Minister, permission is granted by default. It is a worthwhile amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> The issue is glaringly obvious in the section. It holds out an appalling vista. The provision depends on the perfect working of the postal system, computer systems and the bona fides of the person receiving the communication coming together in a perfect package. Real life is not so failsafe or perfect. I hope the legislation can be amended as proposed by Deputy O'Shea. At least it will provide a failsafe mechanism which puts the onus on the applicant or landowner to double check with the Department that there has not been a breakdown in communication. That is a basic requirement and I hope the Minister will recognise the glaring omission in the Bill which Deputy O'Shea's amendment seeks to address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that a landowner must notify the Minister if he or she wishes to carry out work on a designated NHA. The Minister can either prohibit such work or agree to it being carried out. If the Minister does neither within six months of being notified, the landowner can proceed with the work.</P>
      <P>It is only reasonable that landowners have an assurance they will have a decision on their proposed development within a specified period. The Office of the Attorney General is also strongly of this view. Otherwise landowners can be left in limbo in the long-term. It would not be satisfactory to have an onus on the owners, occupiers or users of the land to give a further 14 days notice to the Minister at the conclusion of the stipulated six month period. It would effectively involve the use of the applicant as part of the management process to ensure that his or her application is not overlooked. This would be unfair. It would be a most unusual approach and would not constitute good legislation. Such drafting would also not be to the liking of the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the amendment is motivated by a desire to avoid damage to a NHA through the failure of the Minister to communicate a decision within the six month period. As I outlined on Committee Stage, I am aware that some NGOs have raised concerns about the possibility of the Minister deliberately not replying within six months to allow development to proceed in an underhand way. Such fears are not well founded. Certainly, I would not approach my responsibilities in such a cynical way.</P>
      <P>A more genuine fear might be the possibility of replies not being issued due to pressure of work, oversight and so forth. However, I intend to address this through proper management systems in respect of the process within the Department. This will involve actions such as recording the initial notification and having periodic reviews to ensure all cases are addressed within six months, which is a generous period in this regard. I am confident this system will work well and that the mechanism proposed by Deputy O'Shea is not required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. To the best of my recollection, the <Col N="815" /> Minister conceded on Committee Stage that there is no perfect system and that systems breakdowns occur in the best organisations. She indicated that the amendment would be bad legislation and that she would consider it unfair. I have no wish to be unfair to anybody but all Members have a responsibility with regard to our heritage, particularly NHAs.</P>
      <P>In arriving at a balance between the rights of an applicant and protection of the national heritage, the weight should lie towards our national heritage. If an important component of our national heritage is destroyed, we cannot replace it. A computerised systems failure could be serious where a number of decisions are reached but that communication is not made due to a computer virus. While it appears we are trying to address something that would not happen often, scenarios can develop as a result of which a major difficulty emerges. I would be satisfied if the Minister addressed this issue in the debate on the Bill in the Seanad. If it is more acceptable to the Minister that after five and a half months an applicant would be obliged to indicate that no decision had been reached, that requirement would be as effective as the amendment in addressing the objective of the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is important to take stock of the various problems associated with not amending the Bill, as requested by Deputy O'Shea. From the point of view of our national heritage, property owners and the economy, the country is trying to come to terms with the great damage and destruction caused by the recent flooding. Many of the problems I encountered in recent days have been exacerbated by public officials working under pressure. That is the explanation I have been given as to why planning permissions were given where the infrastructure was not adequate to deal with storm waters. I am sure that from time to time public pressure exists in all Departments and in all local authority offices. The issue at stake is that there should be some safety mechanism to avoid such pressure resulting in destruction by default. This is a moderate and responsible provision. I urge the Minister to reconsider the amendment. The Attorney General's advice would not stand up if, for example, one was to say to the governor of Texas that if he does not get word back about appealing an execution, the execution can go ahead for the sake of not holding up the executioner. While that is a slightly facetious comparison, the same system of justice operates depending on the importance of the application to the person concerned. The applicant could regard it as extremely important. I ask the Minister to take account the need for a fail-safe mechanism.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the Deputies. Deputy O'Shea put forward a variation on the theme. His proposal puts an obligation on the applicant. It would place a further onus on <Col N="816" /> the landowner, which is a problem. That is fraught with legal difficulties.</P>
      <P>Regarding the mechanisms that will be put in place to deal with these issues within a six months period, it would not be a question of leaving everything to the last minute and depending on postal systems or hoping that there would not be computer failures.  I do not envisage such decisions would be taken at the last minute. I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons I outlined. However, I will investigate if another approach can be taken. That can be discussed in the debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  I cannot accept the proposal put forward, as acceptance of it would put an onerous responsibility on landowners, which would be a matter of grave concern to the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Doctors differ and patients die. While I accept that the Attorney General is a eminent jurist, there may be other views on how this issue can be addressed. I am sure the Minister would agree there are pressures regarding the number of planning referrals in her Department and in Dúchas. As the national development plan rolls out, particularly in terms of road infrastructure, I am concerned about the ability of the Department and Dúchas to respond adequately to the increased workload, given their current staffing levels. While I accept fully that it would not be the intention of any Minister to put matters on the long finger, an increased volume of work throws up priorities. If a number of national development projects become priorities, the Government could prioritise projects on the basis of pressure exerted by various Departments. I am not suggesting the Minister would do that, but she will be in office for some of the period of the implementation of the national development plan. Addressing this issue is not as easy as saying systems will develop. The staffing level in the Department is inadequate to deal with the heavy workload they have faced in recent times, which will increase. While onerous conditions should not be imposed on anybody, my amendment or the suggestion does not impose onerous conditions. All they do is impose a further obligation on the applicant that if the applicant does not get a response after five and a half months, as per my suggestion, or after six months, as per my amendment, one further communication would be necessary. In the context of protecting and conserving our heritage, my suggestion or amendment is not underpinned by an inequity, rather inequity underpins the activities of the population who are the custodians and the owners of our heritage.</P>

      <P>This is a further amendment to section 19 which deals with restrictions on carrying out certain works.

      <P>Regarding the requirement that a person notifies the Minister before undertaking works on a notified NHA, Deputy O'Shea proposes that the notification period be extended from three to six months. The requirement that a land owner gives three months notification prior to undertaking any works in a notified NHA amounts to placing a burden on a land owner. The advice from the Attorney General's office is quite clear on this &ndash; any burden placed on the land owner in an NHA must be reasonable. I consider three months to be a reasonable period to require a land owner to wait before he or she can carry out works. To impose a restriction of six months on him or her runs the real danger of being found unreasonable and unnecessary. From the perspective of allowing the Minister sufficient time, a period of three months is adequate to allow the Minister time within which to act; three months allows the Minister sufficient time to undertake any assessment of the implications of the proposed works, to move to designate the site as an NHA or to proceed to seek a court injunction if that is considered necessary.</P>

She would agree that in the context of rolling out various projects under the national plan, which will involve all kinds of excavations all over the country, there is a danger that response times may get longer. I am looking for the notification period to be extended to take cognisance of the strong likelihood that the Department's response time will disimprove rather than the opposite in the short to medium term. There is no great indication here that the Government will provide a significant amount of additional staff to the Department and even if it <Col N="818" /> were so disposed there are shortages of qualified personnel in some professional areas.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) Where permission to carry out works is being granted under <i>subsection (3)</i>, the Minister shall attach any conditions or restrictions to the order as is necessary for the conservation objectives of the natural heritage area concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of section 20, which states that in carrying out works for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, which interest may be of a social or economic nature, and in the absence of an alternative or viable situation, the Minister may decide to give the owner consent to undertake the works.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 11 to 15 address the issues I raised on Committee Stage to some extent and I welcome them in that they set conditions down in more detail. However, they do not take into account that once permission is given to carry out work on a site, that effectively becomes a new site for the purposes of designation. Maybe it is implied, but it needs to be stated. The site has been altered and from planning law one knows that once a site is altered one needs a new permission as we are effectively talking about a new entity to a large extent. That is all the more important in relation to an NHA or any type of designated site because, as we know all too well from dealing with hydrology and flooding in recent days, if a drain is dug it could have a significant knock-on effect on other parts of a site. Other works can also have secondary effects in addition to being related to the areas of the site being worked on.</P>
      <P>I hope amendment No. 10 can be counterbalanced by the Minister's amendments, but they do not set down the conservation objectives underlying the conditions, which I feel is necessary. Perhaps they are implied, but I would like the Minister to tell us what kind of conditions would be considered in her amendments. She should stress the conservation objectives and why those conditions are needed, as that is what we are here to do; to ensure the greatest level of conservation, regardless of what works are allowed.</P>

It is a rather technical legal point but it is very important in terms of the efficient operation of the appeals system. As the text stands, the arbitrator of the appeal goes back to the beginning and must make a fresh start from the first point of the appeal. It is in the public interest in terms of efficiency that one should start with the decision. The onus should be on showing that the decision was unreasonably made by the Minister rather than going back and rehashing the whole thing again. The focus should be on the reasonableness or otherwise of the Minister's decision. This has a number of advantages to recommend it, not least being the cost factor. In this sort of situation nothing in particular is gained from going back to the beginning and rehashing the process all the way through to the decision; the decision as communicated by the Minister should be the subject of the appeal.</P>

Such works may not be carried out without first obtaining the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I inserted an additional provision into section 19 that placed an obligation on a landowner to provide me with three months notice of his or her intention to carry out works in a proposed NHA. This amendment will facilitate me as Minister to make a final decision on designation in the three month period. If, for some reason, this is not feasible, I can seek a court injunction to stop damaging works in such a proposed NHA. It would be an offence to contravene the provisions of this section. Where consent to works is refused, the affected person may object within 30 days and has the right to have the case heard by an independent arbitrator whose decision will be binding.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputies Clune and Sargent tabled amendments that proposed to allow the Minister of the day to attach conditions to a consent of works for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, issued under section 19(3). I agreed to re-examine these issues for Report Stage and I am happy to propose further amendments that will not only meet the concerns of the Deputies but will further enhance the provisions. I thank both Deputies for their input in this regard.</P>
      <P>In light of the amendments I have tabled, I do not believe that amendment No. 10 in the name of Deputy Sargent should be accepted. The Deputy will agree that my proposal will not only meet his requirements but will also enhance his proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 proposes the insertion of a new provision at section 19(4). This will deal with consent to works on an NHA issued in normal <Col N="820" /> circumstances under section 19(1). Such a consent will be given where the works involved are not deemed damaging to an NHA. The provision will allow me, as Minister, to attach conditions to a consent and to vary any such conditions. I will also have the power to revoke a consent if circumstances require this.</P>
    <P>The insertion of the new subsection (5) deals with situations where the Minister of the day gives consent to works in an NHA for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. It is considered that this provision should only be used in exceptional circumstances and it is being inserted on legal advice. This amendment will facilitate the attachment of conditions to a consent and it will also allow the Minister to vary such conditions. Power to revoke a consent if conditions therein are breached is also included in this subsection.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 to section 19(4) is technical in nature and consequential on previous amendments. The insertion is being made on the advice of parliamentary counsel and its purpose is to provide consistent drafting among the various subsections.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 involves the insertion of a new subsection (5)(<i>a</i>) and is a technical amendment consequential on previous amendments. Its purpose is to allow an avenue of appeal to a landowner who is refused consent, has conditions attached to consent or has a previously granted consent to works revoked.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 provides that where an arbitrator makes rulings in relation to such ministerial decisions, these rulings will be binding on the Minister.</P>
    <P>I consider that amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy O'Shea is inadequate, particularly in light of the various amendments I propose to make to section 19 and the extensive involvement of the Attorney General's office in finalising the section. I have proposed amendments to section 19 which will enable the Minister of the day to attach conditions to consent to works, to vary such conditions and to revoke such consent.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with these amendments and on the advice of the Attorney General's office and Parliamentary Counsel I am also making the required consequential amendment to section 19(5)(<i>b</i>). The role of the arbitrator will be to consider all aspects of an appeal which is referred to him or her and to make a determination on the matter. Amendment No. 14 clarifies that in the event of an arbitrator making a ruling in respect of any appeal under section 19, such a decision will be binding on the Minister. Accordingly, I believe that Deputy O'Shea's amendment should be rejected.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point that she has added greatly to the part of the Bill which deals with conditions. I appreciate her efforts in that regard. I do not know whether my amendment has been enhanced but the Minister's amendment is an adequate substitute. I hope that <Col N="821" /> the conservation objectives to which my amendment expressly refers are covered by the amendments tabled by the Minister. With that in mind, I am happy to withdraw my amendment in favour of the Minister's.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that the point I raised has been addressed substantially by the Minister. The Bill, as drafted, reads &ldquo;where the arbitrator determines that the Minister should give consent to the carrying out of the works concerned&rdquo;, whereas my amendment suggests that it should read &ldquo;where the arbitrator determines that the Minister has unreasonably refused to give consent&rdquo;. There is a subtle difference involved because use of the term &ldquo;the Minister should give&rdquo; involves a different judgment. However, if the Minister has received legal advice to the effect that the issues surrounding these amendments are being addressed in the most appropriate way, I will be happy to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 22, line 4, after &ldquo;Where&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, otherwise than in accordance with <i>section 19</i>,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is my advice that the amendment would correct what seems to be a drafting error. Its basis is that the Minister should not be able to serve a notice in connection with works which she had failed to veto under section 19 and which would, therefore, be lawful. Section 19 places restrictions on the carrying out of certain works. We discussed this matter on foot of a different amendment on Committee Stage. The basis of the amendment is that the Minister should not be able to initiate proceedings against works which had lawfully been carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy proposes to limit the application of section 21, which provides powers for the Minister to order restoration of damaged NHAs. There is a danger that the Deputy's proposal could lead to a weakening of the protection afforded to NHAs. In general, I do not anticipate that a direction to restore a site would be made after consent had been given to works under section 19. However, consequent on amendment No. 11, conditions may be attached to a consent issued under that section. In such cases works would be carried out pursuant to a section 19 consent. It would be prudent to have the power to require that restoration be undertaken in cases such as this. It could happen that a person who obtains consent to carry out works under section 19 would not subsequently abide by the conditions attached to the consent. In such cases, if damage was caused to the NHA, it could be that restoration would be appropriate. If the words proposed by the Deputy, &ldquo;otherwise than in accordance with section 19&rdquo;, were inserted, it could be a matter of argument or interpretation whether this person, who had consent, albeit subject to conditions, under section 19 had acted in <Col N="824" /> accordance with that section. The Deputy's proposal would, therefore, leave open the possibility that a person could seek to evade having to carry out restoration works on an NHA in cases where restoration would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>It may be that the Deputy is concerned about a hypothetical situation where a person could be directed to restore a site after he or she had carried out works in good faith after obtaining a consent under section 19. It is not the intention that the section could be used in this manner. More to the point, I have absolutely no doubt that it would not be proper, nor would it be legally feasible to give a person a consent and to then turn around and require him or her to restore the site if damage was caused as a result of actions taken on foot of that consent. Therefore, I cannot accept the Deputy's proposal as it could lead to a weakening of the protection for NHAs.</P>

      <P>22.&ndash;Where works are carried out on land, an application under <i>section 20 </i>may not be made, nor may a direction under <i>section 21 </i>be given, later than 10 years from the date of the carrying out of the works concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment also relates to section 21, which deals with the restoration of land in natural heritage areas. Under the planning Acts there is a limitation period of five years. It seems desirable to have a reasonable limitation period within which the Minister would be required to act, otherwise the conveyancing of land would become a major problem. That is my legal advice. What the amendment boils down to is that if ten years had elapsed since works were carried out on an NHA, the provisions of the Bill relating to restoration would not apply. I would see this, doubling the figure of five years stipulated in the planning Acts in the context of this legislation, as a fair way of approaching the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can understand the intentions of the Deputy in proposing the amendment, having considered it in detail, I cannot accept that it is appropriate for inclusion for a number of reasons. I see a practical difficulty should the proposed amendment be adopted. The crux of the matter is the requirement that would exist to establish definitively when precisely the alleged works within the NHA were carried out. This would necessitate establishing the specific day, or days, on which the alleged works were undertaken. It would be extremely difficult to prove the exact date, or dates, on which the works in question were carried out, particularly if a number of years had elapsed, which is likely in the scenario envisaged by the Deputy. In addition, the obligation on the Minister to determine precisely when the works were carried out <Col N="825" /> could be used, possibly effectively, by the owner-occupier as a means to avoid having to restore the lands.</P>
      <P>In the case of alleged damage to an NHA, where restoration is viable, my Department will act expeditiously to redress the situation by endevouring, where appropriate, to have the site restored as soon as is reasonably practicable. I cannot envisage a situation where many years after the works had allegedly been undertaken my Department would intervene to order the restoration of an NHA. I expect that after such a period it could prove extremely difficult to restore an NHA effectively. In the circumstances I cannot agree to the amendment on the grounds mentioned.</P>

      <P>Section 32 deals with the exclusion of certain wild animals from regulations made. I understand it was necessary to include this section because of the alterations made to the definitions of flora and fauna in the interpretation section. On Committee Stage I drew the attention of the Minister to the reference to section 32 in the explanatory memorandum, the final sentence of which reads, &ldquo;It is expected that such exclusions will apply only to commercially exploitable species&rdquo;. I am seeking to have this restriction written into the legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to hold any referenda or preferenda in relation to constitutional amendments during the current Dáil session.</P>
      <P>During the lifetime of this Dáil, it is hoped to hold a referendum in relation to the International Criminal Court. I understand that preparations are currently taking place in the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to the ratification by Ireland of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It is also hoped to hold a referendum in relation to other matters. However, it is not possible at this stage to give any further details.</P>
      <P>I have not received an interim report on the progress to date of the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, nor do I expect to receive one. As Deputies will be aware, the all-party committee is looking at and will report on various issues such as Parliament, the conduct of referenda, gender proofing, etc., and will report on each issue in due course.</P>

      <P>This issue was last discussed prior to the summer recess when I met all the Independent Deputies. The Deputies specified their views on this matter and all of them indicated their hope to see a referendum being held during the life of this Dáil. I stated recently, as I did to the Independent Deputies when I met them prior to the summer, that the Government's position is that when the all-party committee reports on this matter, it will then be referred to the Cabinet subcommittee, which will make a decision. Until that happens, neither I, nor anyone acting on my behalf, can make a decision on this matter.</P>

They indicated their preference to me very strongly when I spoke to them and, in return, I outlined the Government position to them following the publication of the Green Paper. I presume they will raise this issue again when the Cabinet sub-committee has considered the report of the all-party committee. No decisions can be made until that report is presented to the House and considered by the Cabinet sub-committee so nobody could have made any promises one way or another.</P>

Will the Taoiseach inform the House whether the Treaty of Nice will be subject to a referendum and whether the pledging of in excess of 800 troops to a 60,000 strong rapid reaction force will be the subject of even an advisory referendum? Is there a constitutional requirement for such a referendum in view of the fact that the Irish people did not explicitly sanction such an important and major departure from traditional foreign policy?</P>

The all-party committee has worked very hard on the production of this report and I thank all its members and those who worked on the Green Paper for their efforts. I hope that we can avoid turning this into a divisive issue.</P>
      <P>I stated recently that until we see what is concluded at Nice, I will not be in a position to say whether a referendum will be required. When matters are concluded, I will ask the Attorney General for his advice. Some people believe that a referendum is not necessary while others believe it may be. We will act on the advice we receive from the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution has completed its work and the report will be published next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware of my interest, as a result of our international obligations, in transposing the International Criminal Court into law. A referendum is required on this issue about which the Taoiseach has communicated with me. Is it intended to produce the legislation directly or will the issue be referred to the all-party committee? I am not asking that the matter would be referred, nor am I seeking its referral as a delaying tactic but I am concerned that a referendum be held and legislation enacted as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the all-party committee has already produced four reports although the focus is on the upcoming fifth report? The committee has produced a series of recommendations for constitutional reform which date back over three and a half years. Does the Taoiseach agree that constitutional reform in the lifetime of this Government has proceeded at a snail's pace? Apart from that on local government reform nothing much has happened in relation to the recommendations. Where does the Taoiseach now stand in relation to the work of the committee and the recommendations?</P>

      <P>While the first matter is one for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I understand his intention is to try to get the legislation currently being drafted through the House early in the new year and then to go straight to a referendum. I do not think there would be an objection if the committee wanted to discuss this.</P>
      <P>I thank the vice-chairman of the all-party committee for his work on the reports, including the fifth report. We have had four constitutional referendums in the life of the Government and I do not accept there has not been much work in this context. However, I accept that the second, third and fourth reports, which were published in 1997, 1998 and 1999, have made many recommendations. As I promised, I referred all those to the relevant Departments which have examined the merits of the individual recommendations. Some of the recommendations are technical and others are practical. The issue is whether they can be put together in a single referendum, which is unlikely given the number of issues involved. Some of the matters are straightforward and reasonably simple, some concern gender proofing and others are correctional in nature.</P>
      <P>In most cases I have received reports back from the Departments. The Cabinet secretariat has been looking at how a number of these could be taken together. The Deputy is very familiar with these issues and I think he accepts that there would be great difficulty in trying to take them all together as there would be a very long list. The secretariat has been examining the possibility of multiple referendums which will give effect to as many recommendations as possible. I hope this is possible as many of the things put forward are very practical, but I have to await advice.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy is very keen on raising the judicial aspect and we are very anxious to deal with this. It is probable that this will have to be dealt with separately. The Chair is also very anxious to see the reform and updating of the judicial aspect. The Chair has written to me on the matter with detailed views on the impeachment process and how it can be updated. If we could finalise the two reports, namely that of the committee of which the Deputy is a member and the soon to be completed report of the committee on judicial ethics chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, then perhaps a referendum could be held, and we are considering this course of action.</P>

      <P>The problem I have with these questions is that there would not be much point in having an All-Party Committee on the Constitution if the Government or the Cabinet committee was to prejudge its work. Even though under the terms of reference of the committee I would have been entitled to get draft reports and be updated in this regard, my view is that the committee was entitled to complete its work. As soon as the committee has completed its work we will deal with these issues. It would have been wrong to pre-empt the work of the all-party committee by drafting words and suggesting what might or might not have been in the report. We did not do so, but I assure Deputy Bruton that as soon as the report of the all-party committee is formally given to me I will ensure the Cabinet committee resumes its work.

      <P>Secondly, as a people used to proportional representation, does he accept that the holding of a &ldquo;preferendum&rdquo; should be relatively straightforward and could help us arrive at a greater consensus on the issues at stake, rather than an approach based on the winner takes all, divisive referendum process? Does he accept that constitutional change is only one reason for having a referendum or a &ldquo;preferendum&rdquo; and that the option of an advisory referendum or &ldquo;preferendum&rdquo; exists and has not yet been exercised?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The specific recommendations in the Nally report on the public prosecution system relating to the Chief State Solicitor's office were the transfer of the Criminal Division of the CSSO to the DPP and the transfer of the State Solicitor Services from the Attorney General to the DPP. Neither has been fully implemented at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated previously that a group comprising representatives from the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General, including the Chief State Solicitor's office, and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, was set up to oversee implementation of the recommendations. A key part of the arrange<Col N="835" /> ments for the transfer was the staffing levels and structures necessary in the enhanced prosecution services and, in parallel, in the CSSO. Extensive negotiations took place with the IMPACT Trade Union and proposals were put to the members but were rejected. Efforts to find a solution are continuing. In preparation for the transfer, there are regular meetings between the DPP's Office and the CSSO to discuss all the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Management and staff side agreement was reached on filling the new post of solicitor to the DPP. Arrangements to fill this post are in train and an appointment is expected soon. The person appointed will have a key role to play in the implementation process.</P>
    <P>The transfer of responsibility for local State solicitors has received some preliminary examination but the detailed arrangements must await the appointment of the solicitor to the DPP.</P>
    <P>A team comprising CMOD (Department of Finance) and the CSSO compiled the report Recommendations for Change in the CSSO. It dealt with a range of administrative procedures and practices within the office and a number of the recommendations have already been implemented. The report is in the Library of the Houses and I will arrange to have an update on the present position in relation to the recommendations also placed in the Library.</P>
    <P>I can add that the Office of the Attorney General, including the Chief State Solicitor's office, has recently completed the tendering process for a new IT plan. The first phase of this would be the development of information, application and technical strategies for the offices. It will include an examination of each area of the office, their business requirements and their liaison requirements with all stakeholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply. I am not sure whether he stated that the new position of solicitor to the Director of Public Prosecutions had in fact been provided for. In a report in a newspaper of 25 April 2000 it was indicated in an interview with Mr. James Hamilton that legislation would be required to create that post. I am not sure in the context of the Taoiseach's reply whether that specific post and the necessary legislation to underpin it had been introduced. If it has not happened are there plans to introduce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, management and staff side agreement was reached on filling the new post of solicitor to the DPP. Arrangements to fill this post are in train and an appointment is expected soon. Obviously legislation is not required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that of all the technical services available to Government at national and local level the legal services have been deficient in terms of the numbers of personnel who are available to it, for a variety of <Col N="836" /> reasons? Has he considered, therefore, in the light of the failure of the Government to fill the necessary posts at national and local level, the contracting out of some of the services to ensure that the State and its citizens get the necessary and speedy legal service which they require?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an enormous increase in staffing in the past five or six years and again recently there has been a large increase in staffing levels. With the implementation of the Nally report, whatever the final IR resolutions are to this issue, there will be a further substantial filling of posts. There is no ideological reason for not contracting out legal work. In the recent past work has been contracted out in many areas to lighten the work load. The Government would prefer that legal work which is considered to be of a specialist public law and of central importance to the Government and the State would be done by the State legal services but with other work where there is no difficulty many Departments are doing that. The kind of work that should be held within the system are judicial reviews, constitutional challenges, cases where significant issues of principle for the State are to be decided. In other cases, and increasingly so, more and more of the work is being contracted out.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of staff who resigned in each of the past three years from his Department, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Office of the DPP to take up outside positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19842/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of staff who resigned from my Department in 1998 was seven, a further ten resigned in 1999 and this year, 13 staff have resigned to date. As staff are not required to give their reasons for resigning, my Department has no records in relation to the number of those who resigned to take up outside employment.</P>
      <P>In the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, one member of staff resigned in 1998 and two in 1999. There have been no resignations so far this year.</P>
      <P>In the Chief State Solicitor's office there were 13 resignations in 1998 of which two were from the permanent staff and 11 were contract staff. In 1999 a total of 26 staff resigned, of which 15 were permanent staff and 11 were contract staff. So far in 2000, 25 staff have resigned of which 15 were permanent staff and ten contract.</P>
      <P>The majority of staff resigning from my Department are in the clerical grades. This pattern is reflected in the Office of the DPP and Chief State Solicitor's office. The Chief State Solicitor's office is also losing staff in the professional and technical grades both from the permanent and contract staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the statistics he has just read into the record concerning clerical, administrative and technical resignations, highlights the very point I made in my earlier question &ndash; that we effectively have a crisis in maintaining staffing levels in the areas where the State is under considerable pressure because of legal actions being taken against it by citizens, as is their right? I am not trying to be adversarial but, in light of those statistics, is the Taoiseach satisfied he has the necessary flexibility to hire and retain clerical, administrative and technical staff to ensure the State can do the job with which it is charged? If the Taoiseach is not satisfied, what steps will he take, or what proposals does he have, to provide the necessary resources to do the job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work in clerical areas comes under the aegis of the Civil Service Commission. Posts that are being lost in those areas are not creating great difficulties. It is not nice losing any staff who have settled in, but I must commend the commission on filling those posts very quickly. The problems are in the legal area where the norm is always for such offices to have contract staff. Until recent years, contract staff would remain as long as they could hold their contracts. Now, however, because of the strength of the economy they are getting jobs outside the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good news for them but bad news for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. This year there will be approximately a 7% turnover of professional staff. I would not describe it as a crisis although it is certainly making things difficult and creating pressures. To go back to my reply to the last question, it means that essential work that needs to be done by the State should be done, and it would make sense to contract out work in some areas. It will probably be more expensive, but it will have to be done to keep the system moving, and that has been happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes occurring on the technical side are even greater. Opportunities in the private sector, including industry, insurance, finance and the law, are provoking a quicker turnover of staff. The core work I have specified in the Chief State Solicitor's office must be maintained, but it also means some other professional technical work must be contracted out, if possible. I have no ideological difficulty with that. It is better to do that than to create undue backlogs which would leave us back where we were with the difficulties caused by pressures on clerical staff. I hope the discussions that are currently going on will be finalised &ndash; as soon as the new solicitor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is on board &ndash; with the DPP and the Attorney General. That will probably mean another 40 plus staff in the Department. I take Deputy Quinn's <Col N="838" /> point, which is to make sure the system works effectively and there are no backlogs or other difficulties. Where it makes sense we should, as far as possible, not restrict work being contracted out. I have no difficulty with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the serious point raised by Deputy Quinn. If it is not a crisis then it is heading towards one if our law officers are unable to fulfil their obligations. Does the Taoiseach accept that in quite a number of areas a considerable backlog has been created, perhaps inevitably? In some instances, this backlog could leave the State open to court action. Does he accept that a more determined approach is needed to cope with the problem? He mentioned 40 new appointees, but are they there? Even if approval is given for a further 40 appointments, does the Taoiseach think they can be found on the basis of current terms of employment? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean this as a glib or simple answer, but the problem in the Civil Service today is not finding people, it is keeping them, particularly in legal grades. We are losing many clerical people because they are doing very well outside the Civil Service where rates of pay are extremely good. I have been noting the rate of increase in pay scales in recent weeks. Many legal staff work under contract in the public service in order to gain experience which they consider is valuable, but then they move on perhaps because the rates are not as good as those in the private sector. Even though numbers have increased and conditions have improved, the main reason the June discussions failed was due to the length and rate of grades which are linked to the analogues. In the end that was the breaking issue. Now they are back in discussions again. I have said we have to be realistic and have to relate grades to what is happening in the private sector, but there is a knock-on effect. That was the real issue, not staff numbers or the work load, even though that is very demanding. I acknowledge the work that is undertaken by staff. Even though improvements were made to the structure of the grades, people still saw that it took too long to reach the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In earlier years when we had other jobs, people lived with grades where it took 17 and 21 years to reach the top, but that is not acceptable to people now and it is creating difficulties. People coming into the public service have professional and technical qualifications for which they worked hard. While they are glad to be in the public service, after two or three years' experience they can transfer to the private sector which is growing rapidly. I provided figures for that growth in the financial services sector, both last week and yesterday in the House. If one breaks down the jobs being created in the financial services sector, a great number of them are in the legal and technical areas, even though they are branded in the financial category. The rates of <Col N="839" /> pay are substantially more than anything we can pay. That is the honest answer I have to give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that justice delayed is justice denied? Many of the actions being initiated by small people, or which are taken on their behalf, against the State are being inordinately delayed because of the lack of staff and resources. Would the Taoiseach also agree that some years ago when a similar staffing crisis in competition terms occurred in the IT section of the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; I suspect during the time when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, and certainly when I held that post &ndash; the Commissioners, with the authorisation of the Department of Finance, were able to pay an additional IT loyalty bonus to staff with specialist skills for which there was a high market demand? If the Taoiseach accepts that such a precedent exists elsewhere for skills that can be ring fenced as being unique to a particular category of people, in light of all the extraordinary evidence he has put on the record, would he not accept that there is a necessity for some kind of creative intervention to deal with a haemorrhage of technical and administrative staff, which is undoubtedly denying justice to people at present? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be factual about this. While the work load put in for a number of years past has been heavy, there have not been enormous delays. There are pressures on the system, however. Following the detailed negotiations, there have been improvements in recent years, including significant improvements in staff numbers, promotional outlets and starting scales. They were put to the union again in June but were rejected for the reasons I have stated. While there are serious difficulties I do not think they are insurmountable. They are being addressed and steps have been taken to provide better office-wide IT systems, organisational structures, library and information facilities, strategic planning, training and development. All these items are in place but even so, staff are being lost in both the legal and technical sectors. As regards the negotiations, I have said that they will have to find imaginative ways to proceed.</P>
      <P>I will not disagree with the Deputy. The offer in June was a good one but was resoundingly rejected. I cannot remember the figures but they were not in the ballpark of acceptance. It must be re-examined comprehensively to resolve this matter and I have said as much to the people involved.</P>
      <P>The model the Deputy and I created &ndash; although I must give the Deputy more credit for it &ndash; is now causing problems even in the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Some people are being offered up to £10,000 more than the point at which they are on the scale. That is good news for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work conditions may not always be as good as in other periods but the private sector is giving staff members in the Oireachtas and elsewhere £5,000 more than they earn for jobs which, while important, are linked to clerical and administrative grades. That is not to speak of the information technology area where people can earn £10,000 more. That is great for employment.</P>
      <P>The old problem in the Civil Service and analogous grades was always that there was no movement or progress and that a young person had to wait for people to retire to advance. That has been turned on its head. However, I accept we have a job to do and that this work must continue. While we have devoted huge resources to the area of facilities, we must still conclude this set of negotiations with IMPACT to ensure we continue to have an excellent service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The independent inquiries conducted by the former Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, continued through the summer months. I understand that Mr. Hamilton had advanced his examination considerably and had hoped to have his work <Col N="841" /> concluded and his report prepared within a period of months.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, on 29 September last, Mr. Hamilton informed me that he would be unable to continue with his inquiries for health reasons. Mr. Hamilton has undergone operative intervention which is being followed by a period of treatment. I thank Mr. Hamilton for taking on the task and for the tremendous commitment, dedication and hard work he brought to his inquiries. I convey to him my good wishes and those of the House for his full and speedy recovery.</P>
    <P>The Government has now appointed the former Supreme Court judge, Henry Barron, to succeed Mr. Hamilton. On behalf of the Government, I thank Mr. Barron for agreeing to take on this task and I wish him well in his work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of assistance from other jurisdictions, when Mr Hamilton began his inquiries the Government conveyed to the British authorities that this examination had been put in place and our wish and expectation of co-operation from them, together with the likelihood that there would be more specific requests for their co-operation as the examination developed to the point where detailed requests could be formulated. This remains our expectation and Mr. Hamilton has not indicated that any difficulty has arisen in this regard.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the Taoiseach's remarks about the former Chief Justice, Liam Hamilton, and I wish him a full and speedy recovery. I thank him for the work he has undertaken.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the recently published work by Mr. Don Mullan on this outrage is a positive contribution towards the inquiry? Has the Taoiseach had any indication at this early stage from the former Justice, Mr. Barron, as to when he will be in a position to submit his preliminary report which, if I recall correctly, will be the basis on which a decision to have a full-blown inquiry will be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Barron will require some time, possibly a few weeks, to familiarise himself with Mr. Hamilton's work in progress which is well documented. I hope at that stage we will have a firmer view of the task ahead. We will give him every assistance.</P>
      <P>The book by Don Mullan and the work of the Justice for the Forgotten group have contributed effectively to the process. We assist them in every way to do that, including offices, facilities and finance. Unfortunately, we have been delayed by a few weeks, but I hope we will not lose too much time.</P>

      <P>It is not for me to set a timescale for Mr. Barron. He is the sole member of an independent commission, is not obliged to report progress and does not report to me. Mr. Hamilton informed that he hoped to try to advance his work towards the end of the year. As in all cases such as this, one thing leads to another and Mr. Hamilton had progressed extensively on these matters through files and examinations and discussions with other jurisdictions. Rather than state a time limit on the record, I would rather state that I will keep the House informed of Mr. Barron's progress.</P>

I accept this has gone on for a long time, since May 1974, but this inquiry and its work began in February 2000. We want to see the work done correctly. Not wishing to speak for either Mr. Barron or Mr. Hamilton, I am sure both would like to see their work completed and handed over. They have no reason other than to see it completed as soon as possible. However, I do not want to set a time.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Gregory's point about the Justice for the Forgotten group and the relatives, Mr. Hamilton met them and briefed them fully, even after his departure, because he wished to do that.</P>
      <P>They are <i>au fait</i> with the position. Mr. Barron will also do that. They have an officer working with the system and that has been funded.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Keeffe, a group of the relatives and their legal advisers had a meeting with Mr. Adam Ingram to underscore the desire for full co-operation from the authorities in Northern Ireland. I know that during Mr. Hamilton's period there were no difficulties but they had that meeting to emphasise that they wanted that co-operation and I am sure it will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1999, the European Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland before the European Court of Justice on the grounds that Ireland had failed to take all the measures necessary to comply with specified provisions of Direc<Col N="844" /> tives 75/442/EEC on waste, as amended in 1991; 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste; and 94/62/EEC on packaging and packaging waste.</P>
    <P>Under these directives, member states are required to draw up one or more waste management plans, addressing specified requirements; draw up, either separately or in the framework of their general waste management plans, plans for the management of hazardous waste; and include in waste management plans a specific chapter on the management of packaging and packaging waste. These requirements are fully transposed into Irish legislation by means of Part II of the Waste Management Act, 1996, and the Waste Management (Planning) Regulations, 1997. Under this legislation, local authorities are required, jointly or otherwise, to make waste management plans in regard to their functional areas which respect the relevant requirements of the directives outlined while the Environmental Protection Agency is required to make a national hazardous waste management plan.</P>
    <P>If the case brought by the Commission is upheld, Ireland will be required, under the EC Treaty, to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the court. Failure to do so within a specified time limit may result in the imposition on Ireland of a lump sum or penalty payment. The level of any such penalty is at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the Local Government Bill, 2000, whereby the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may reduce or withhold payment of any grant or any other money due or otherwise payable to a local authority if, in the opinion of the Minister, that authority has failed, or substantially failed, to comply with a statutory duty under any enactment.</P>
    <P>To date, regional waste management plans have been adopted in respect of the Dublin and mid-west regions, while Donegal, Kildare and Wicklow County Councils have adopted individual waste management plans. Of the remaining 23 local authorities, 17 have adopted their regional waste plan but these plans have not to date been adopted by all of the local authorities in their respective regions.</P>
    <P>Clearly, it is imperative that these remaining local authorities complete the current strategic planning process as soon as possible. I am considering the possible use of a number of powers that are available to me under the Waste Management Act, 1996, with a view to expediting the completion of this process, and I am taking legal advice in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge there is a waste management crisis looming regarding the completion of the life of many landfill sites and the lack of an alternative? Is he aware there is deep cynicism and anger that he has not put a national waste management plan in place or considered the establishment of a national waste management authority? He could <Col N="845" /> take direct control of these issues. Will he consider taking national measures along those lines?</P>
      <P>As regards the Minister's interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 23 October, is it his intention to cut the domestic rate support grant to certain local authorities and move from reserve to executive function many of the waste management responsibilities currently dealt with by councillors? There was an explicit threat in the article that both would be done. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The crisis in waste management is more than looming; it is upon us although some local authorities do not seem to realise that. There is a serious problem. The number of landfills is reducing on a steady basis and no alternatives are in place in some cases. I have no illusions but that it is a serious matter. I wish some local authorities would acknowledge that fact.</P>
      <P>As regards the rate support grant, it is no longer in place. The reference by the Deputy was to the local government fund and the possibility that I would withhold payment of any grant to make up for fines levied on us as a result of lack of action in some areas. I mentioned in my reply that provision has been made in the Local Government Bill whereby the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may reduce or withhold payments to local authorities. That is an option. Under the Waste Management Act there are a number of options open to me. I can formally require two or more local authorities to jointly make a plan; I can prescribe a date by which waste management plans must be made and I can give a general policy direction to local authorities regarding the making of waste management plans. However, at this stage four local authorities are holding up 17 others seeking approval for waste management plans. I have indicated to them that I would like them to reconsider the position they have adopted. I will give them a short time in which to do that. In the meantime, I am seeking legal advice on the various options and will pursue the most effective one when I reach that stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a date for its publication. However, I am not waiting for publication of that report but am considering the options that will be open to me regarding local authorities that have not adopted regional waste management plans. At the end of that, and having taken legal advice, I will make a final decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that interview the Minister mentioned that he was considering taking away powers granted to members and making them an executive function of councils. What did the Minister mean by that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was &ndash; I am open to correction as I do not have the article in front of me &ndash; that was one of the options. At present, the adoption of a waste management plan, regional or otherwise, is a reserve function of the members of the local authority. The members must make the decision on that. One of the options open to me would be to remove that power from the members and make it an executive function, one that could be decided by the manager without reference to the members. That is an option I will have to look at but one which I would be most reluctant to pursue. I have committed myself as much as possible over the past number of years to restoring and giving powers to local authorities. There is also an onus on local authorities and their members to act in a responsible manner. That balance must be struck. That was the reference I made to executive powers. It is an option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister understand the position local councillors find themselves in? They are listening to prescriptive solutions from the Minister and they have to face all the odium of very strong regional and local objections to incineration and landfill sites. I met the EPA this summer. I asked them if there was a national waste strategy and they said none existed.</P>
      <P>There is a case for a national waste management authority that would create a critical mass and organise all the recycling issues. Has the Minister given any thought to what he can do in relation to the delivery of so many facets of work? The establishment of a national waste management authority would bridge the gap between the Minister's ivory tower and the councillors on the ground and would be a way to get the optimum number of landfill, thermal treatment and other facilities that are required in a national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to great trouble to outline to local authorities a very clearly defined policy on waste management. It was the view of this House, when the Deputy was on this side and I was in Opposition, that the Waste Management Act was the way to deal with this and to leave full responsibility with local authorities. I quickly discovered when I became Minister that that would not work because the critical mass would not be available on a parochial, county by county basis.</P>
      <P>I put in place Changing our Ways, the policy document which suggested regional waste management planning. The local authorities adopted the strategies in that and the ideas in relation to the waste hierarchy and the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle. However, when it came to the plan and there was opposition to landfill or thermal treatment in particular places, councillors balked at making a final decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the strongest supporter in this House of local government. However, we should not automatically go the route proposed by the Deputy <Col N="847" /> just because the alternative is inconvenient for councillors or they have to make a responsible decision in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I accept the fact that setting up a national waste management authority is an option and I will consider it. However, it will not solve our immediate problems and the problems local authorities will have in relation to finding sites for landfill, thermal treatment and so on. It is not a panacea. Perhaps, if it had been decided in 1996, when the Waste Management Act was being enacted, to set up a national waste management authority, we would not be in this situation. However, we are in this situation and it must be faced. We have spent two years on the plans. This has caused grief for individual councillors and local authorities.</P>

      <P>I welcome the very comprehensive report of the commission on the private rented residential sector. The recommendations contained in it are far reaching and, I believe, can form the basis for a radical reform of the private rented sector in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the recommendations have implications for the landlord and tenant legislative code and for the taxation code which are the responsibility of my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance, respectively. Consultations with a number of relevant Departments are taking place in relation to these issues. The report has <Col N="848" /> also been considered by the housing forum, which generally supported the recommendations and considered they would provide a good basis for the long-term development of the sector, if implemented as a package.</P>
    <P>I intend to submit to Government comprehensive proposals arising from the report as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister of State to describe the report, I asked him what he was going to do about it. Has the Government accepted the recommendations of the report? What happened to the Minister of State's promise in July, when the report was published, to submit proposals to Government in September? Is he making proposals to Government to introduce legislation to provide some protection for the 500,000 people in this country living in private rented accommodation who have no legal protection against summary eviction and rents being put up at any time and by any amount a landlord feels like?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals are under discussion with a number of Departments. The draft memorandum has been prepared and discussed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a bit optimistic. There is no deliberate delay in proceeding with the issue. The issues are complex and a number of other Departments are involved. The Government is proceeding as a matter of urgency with its consideration of it. It will involve very extensive legislation, which will have to be drawn up after the Government has made its decisions. All will be revealed when the Government decision is finally made in regard to the matters.</P>
      <P>However, the Government supports the general thrust of the commission's report. I want to express my sincere appreciation to the chairman, Tom Dunne, and all the members of the commission who worked very hard on this important national issue for over 12 months and produced a very comprehensive report.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office I have commissioned three major reports on the housing market with particular focus on the supply of and demand for housing and the affordability of housing. The Government has responded positively to the findings of these reports in Action on House Prices &ndash; April 1998, Action on the Housing Market &ndash; March 1999 and earlier this year in Action on Housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government strategy, which is proving effective, is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers. Since 1997 housing output has increased by 20% and is expected to reach 50,000 units this year. House price data for recent months indicate further moderation in the rate of increase in average house prices. There is also firm evidence that first time buyers are gain<Col N="851" /> ing an increasing share of the new housing market. These trends may be attributed to reduced investor activity in response to measures introduced in Action on Housing and the sustained increases in housing output.</P>
    <P>The provision of £6 billion for social and affordable housing in the national development plan, augmented by further investment of almost £1 billion announced in Action on Housing, will ensure that the social and affordable housing needs of almost 100,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act, which was commenced on 1 November, requires local authorities to prepare housing strategies to address the housing needs of all sectors of the community, including those in need of social and affordable housing. This requires local authorities to make an assessment of current and projected needs for housing in their areas, to prepare housing strategies and vary their development plans to incorporate the strategies. Guidelines for planning authorities on the preparation of their housing strategies together with a model housing strategy are being finalised and will be published later this month.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State's hard neck in refusing to recognise the reality that, of all the Government's failures in the past three years, the most spectacular has been with regard to housing. Will he acknowledge that there are 40,000 people in the greater Dublin area who cannot afford a house, given that the average industrial wage is £16,000 and the average price of a house in Dublin is in excess of £200,000? Will he also acknowledge that there will be a further crisis with the huge increase in rents due to the implementation of the Bacon reports and that the house purchase crisis will move into the rented sector? Will he acknowledge that the SLI and the three Bacon reports have been a failure in bringing about stability in house prices over the past three years? Will he take direct action to ensure there is adequate planning staff and speedy resolution of contracts for sanitary services so serviced land can be made available to build the 60,000 houses per year we require?</P>

      <P>All the infrastructure proposals that were necessary to increase the supply of building land have been approved by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. Two years ago the local authorities were invited to submit proposals for opening land zoned for residential development but which could not be developed because it did not have services. Under the serviced land initiative approximately 129,000 sites will have come on stream by the end of next year. The figure is already nearly 100,000. That is in excess of what we initially expected. There has been outstanding <Col N="852" /> improvement with regard to serviced residential zoned land.</P>
      <P>The local authorities have been asked to increase their house building programmes and to front load them as far as possible. With regard to house prices and the demand for housing, the Deputy must recognise that there has been a huge increase in demand. To get the house building industry to the level of increased capacity to increase its output, it was necessary to examine the entire industry. A range of steps have been taken to remove what were identified as obstacles or constraints.</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to planning has improved enormously, as has the availability of serviced land. Funding from the Department for public and social housing has been expanded enormously.</P>

      <P>Government policy has focused on housing supply. We have been building record numbers of houses in recent years in response to the sustained high level of demand. The demand has been boosted by record levels of economic growth, historically low interest rates, increasing employment, rising levels of personal disposable income and the demographic changes, including high immigration and growth in the key household formation population age groups. These factors have presented us with a huge challenge and we are responding to it. Total output in 1997&mdash;</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 345 of 17 October 2000, in which I outlined that while my Department does not publish definitive information on the average house price paid by first time buyers, analysis of house purchase loan survey data available to my Department indicates that typical first time buyer prices are generally around 25% to 30% below the overall average house price. The survey, which includes information on about 30% of all mortgage based housing transactions, reveals the following annual trends in national average new house prices purchased by first time buyers. The average price paid by first time buyers for a new house in 1997 was £74,000 while in 1998 it was £81,500. Last year, the average first time buyer new house price was £99,600. In the first six months of this year the average new house price paid by first time buyers was £110,700.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister outlined several policies he intends to implement to increase supply and reduce the increase in house prices.</P>
      <P>With regard to compiling figures, he employed consultants to devise a calculation method for his Department. At what stage is their report? When can we expect the list of strategic development zones? We have heard much about them, but that list has not yet been published.</P>

I would like to hear his views on the claim by members of Century Homes that they consider the wooden struc<Col N="854" /> ture home has been hindered by a policy of his Department.

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's reply reflects the position in which he finds himself. He cannot answer the hard questions. He can give replies to questions he was not asked. He can tell us about the rental commission, but when he is asked about a few hard facts, what the figures are, he is not capable of giving an answer.</P>
      <P>He talked about local authorities implementing a model housing strategy. When will that famous model be presented? At what stage is it? It is similar to the Town Renewal Bill, which was passed in June, but cannot be implemented as local authorities do not have guidelines on how to implement it. It is fantastic to pass legislation and set out details of it in a document, but nothing can be done in this case because the Government has not put in place the necessary human and fiscal resources to facilitate its implementation.</P>

      <Quest>the practical measures in place to support the higher recycling of waste here; and the way in which it is proposed to implement the projected recycling targets contained in many waste management plans being adopted by local authorities.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24714/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As outlined in the 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, overall Government policy on waste management is committed to a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management approach, which will deliver ambitious recovery and recycling targets over a 15 year period. These include: a diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill; a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill; the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum; and recycling of 35% of municipal waste.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these targets, current and proposed regional waste management plans incorporate proposals for household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas;an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas, typically with a target density of one facility per 500 population; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities; and support for home composting of food and garden waste, especially in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is imperative local authorities complete the current strategic planning process and proceed with the implementation of waste management plans to build upon the good progress that has <Col N="858" /> been made since 1998. The national network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities has increased to more than 1,000 sites. A segregated household collection service for recyclables is being progressively extended throughout the Dublin region. Repak Ltd., which was established by industry to organise and finance the recovery of packaging waste, recently initiated a new scheme to give waste contractors an incentive to recover additional amounts of packaging waste, while further industry-led initiatives are being pursued in relation to construction and demolition waste, end of life vehicles and electrical and electronic waste.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>To support the delivery of improved waste services and infrastructure under these regional plans, some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>I will shortly publish a policy statement on waste prevention and recovery. This will address in detail the factors and practical considerations that are relevant to the achievement of policy objectives and targets in this area, and will outline the scope of measures that will be undertaken in support of a better national recycling performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister admit that while everyone, including the Minister and ourselves, is in favour of recycling, the necessary infrastructure is not in place? There is no recycling of plastics here and, with the exception of paper-cardboard, we export many other such products. Does the Minister have proposals to introduce a public private partnership project to put in place the necessary infrastructure?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that most European cities have a twin bin system? Refuse lorries collect waste from twin bins in which dry recycables can be stored on one side. Will the Minister take the simple step of introducing a fleet, particularly in the local authority sector, of refuse collections that will facilitate a twin bin system? These are practical measures that could be introduced in terms of infrastructure and in relation to procurement. Will he adopt a positive bias to buy the products of the recycling industry to ensure there will be viable markets for them? There are practical steps he can take and will he take them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I do not disagree with much of what Deputy Yates said, but waste management is a matter for local authorities. It is for local authorities to introduce these systems and I favour some of the systems the Deputy mentions, but that is what is contained in the regional waste management plans. I mentioned some of them, in particular the household segregation and separate col<Col N="859" /> lection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas, extending the network of bring-back facilities in rural areas; all these measures are in the waste management plans.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the whole focus of the regional waste management plans is on the end solution. Most of the plans refer to integrated solutions and to trying to achieve recycling rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe the targets he mentioned will be met by wishing they will be met? He must be aware that recycling is not a profit-making business and is more expensive than using landfills. What direct subsidies will the Minister offer people or local authorities setting up recycling facilities? What has his Department done in the last three years except ask local authorities to adopt waste management plans? Has his Department done anything else to advance recycling, which is the answer to the problem and is laid out in all the regional plans?</P>

In the period 1994 to 1999 70 local authorities invested in various recycling infrastructure projects under the operational programme and they will have the opportunity to do so again. Those which have not adopted regional waste management plans and which are not operating the polluter pays principle will not be eligible for EU funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 111 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries, each by at least 20%, by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report, published in July 1999, and second progress report, published in August 2000, detail progress with key actions. Copies of both reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are available in the Oireachtas Library. Good progress has been made in the first two years of the strategy period in relation to its primary targets. <Col N="861" /> By end 1999, road deaths had been reduced by nearly 13% relative to 1997 and serious injuries from road accidents had been reduced by over 15%.</P>
    <P>Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with nearly 300 schemes now likely to be completed by end 2000. On the other hand, recent NRA surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reduction of speeding and an increase in seat belt wearing. Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. Over 175,000 on the spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 1999 and more than 160,000 up to mid September this year. Fixed speed cameras are in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. Nearly 70,000 on the spot fines have been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. Evidential breath testing is being progressively introduced in relation to drink driving enforcement.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy envisages a penalty points system as a key measure in support of road safety enforcement. The Government approved the drafting of legislation necessary for this measure on 26 July 2000. The design of the system has, as stated in the strategy, required careful consideration because of the exclusive constitutional role of the Irish courts in the administration of justice. The Bill will also provide for some elements of random breath testing and the further refinement of the legal framework for the detection and processing of offences. The drafting of the Bill is now proceeding as a matter of urgency with a view to its publication by the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his answer, which is almost identical to the answer he gave on 29 June 2000 except for the sentence in that answer which indicated that a second progress report was to be published the following month. Was that report published and what has happened to it?</P>
      <P>Also, in relation to the introduction of the penalty points system, the Minister of State said in June that the practical implementation of that system, apart from the legislative aspect, would require the introduction of a computerised national driving licence file. What progress has been made in establishing that file and when does he expect it to be completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The second progress report was published in August. I will send the Deputy a copy if he does not have one. I have stated on a number of occasions that even with the legislation in place it would not be possible to operate the <Col N="862" /> penalty points system until all the holders of driving licences are on file in a computerised system. It will only work when that is in place and it is expected that that will be in place by the end of next year, as I have said on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will support the speedy enactment of legislation on road safety. In relation to the programme for dipped lights last weekend, will the Minister of State consider introducing a regulation whereby dipped lights would be compulsory in the winter months, as is the case in many Scandinavian countries? Also, does the Minister of State have any plans to reform the driving test? There has been concern in Europe about our driving test and both these issues are key matters of road safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of headlights is something on which I hold strong views. It is to be looked at by the National Safety Council and the high level group regarding the road safety strategy and was included as an objective in the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Safety Council, on a voluntary basis, asked people to do so last weekend and to create a greater awareness of and support for road safety. It tried to get across to people that everyone has ownership of the road safety campaign. Everyone is involved. It comes down to how an individual acts when in charge of a vehicle or using the roads and highways. This matter involves a great deal of personal responsibility and campaigns. Changes in road structures and the introduction of new legislation, penalties and enforcement procedures on their own will not achieve the objective to completely eliminate road deaths and serious accidents.</P>
      <P>The results of the experiment which took place will be considered. I thought that experiment was successful because of the tremendous reaction from the public. It will be considered in the context of its being introduced on a permanent basis, but not until further examinations are carried out. Studies have been done in other countries, a number of which have already introduced the system. We will make a decision on the matter when we receive the result of further studies.</P>

However, there was a dramatic reduction in the number of road fatalities in November last year. I am not stating that this was a direct result of the campaign but such campaigns have an effect.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Quest>if he will change the current policy of his Department to ensure there is a special grant made available to local authorities for the provision of open spaces and the development of such spaces into playing pitches, children's playgrounds, parks and so on, in order that the local authority are not dependent on the housing allocation for the provision of these amenities, as is currently the case.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1994, local authorities are empowered to provide, operate and maintain parks and open spaces for amenity and recreational purposes. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the extent to which resources ought to be applied to the provision of such parks and open spaces.</P>
      <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational facilities and amenity areas in local authority housing schemes is also a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. Appropriate limited facilities of this kind can be funded from my Department's capital allocations where the work is undertaken in conjunction with the provision of new local authority housing or the refurbishment of existing housing under the remedial works scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 10 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, a planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of that plan. It must also include objectives for the zoning of land for particular purposes, including for recreation or as open space, where the planning authority considers this to be appropriate. In addition, Section 48 of the Act provides for a new system for the levying of development contributions which, as a condition of the planning permission, are paid by the developer in respect of public infrastructure and facili<Col N="865" /> ties which benefit the development and which are provided by the local authority. The type of public infrastructure and the facilities involved include the provision of community facilities. Furthermore, the Local Government Bill, 2000, allows for the establishment of a community fund to support local initiatives, including amenity and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>In light of these new provisions and the financial possibilities they provide for local authorities, the issue raised by the Deputy has been fully addressed by the Department. The onus now lies with local authorities to utilise fully the provisions of the legislation to which I referred to facilitate such developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>That is an infantile answer. Is it not a fact that the money provided by the Minister's Department relates to housing and, perhaps, open spaces? However, the provision of open spaces does not even arise because of the shortage of houses. The Minister is in blatant dereliction of his duty by not providing a separate fund in respect of the provision of open spaces, playgrounds and parks. As a result we are faced with problems of drunkenness, drug taking, urban blight, vandalism, joy-riding and the creation of ghettos. From the tone of his reply and previous replies on the matter, it appears that the Minister does not give a damn. Why does he not do something constructive by making a separate allocation in respect of the facilities to which I refer?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 21:</P>
    <P Just="Center">In page 32, line 4, after &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which in the opinion of the Minister is fit for commercial exploitation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy O'Shea)</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal as briefly as possible with the point at issue here. I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister concluded by stating that she had had discussions with the Department of the Marine and Natural <Col N="867" /> Resources and various angling groups which appeared to be satisfied with the approach her Department is taking. She also said that, apart from purely commercial species <i>per se</i>, the intention was that species relevant to other types of fishing such as sport or recreational fishing, for example for coarse fishing, would also be listed in regulations to be made under section 32.</P>
      <P>The problem to which I drew attention on Committee Stage and to which I return is that the concluding sentence of the reference in the explanatory memorandum to section 32, which I am seeking to amend, reads, &ldquo;It is expected that such exclusions will apply only to commercially exploitable species&rdquo;. Following Committee Stage, the Bill goes a good deal further. When did the discussions with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and angling groups take place? Did they only take place immediately prior to Committee Stage?</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to agree to the proposed format without amendment. It would be a good restriction to place on a Minister that only commercially exploitable species could be included in regulations. If other species are included, what guarantees are there that they will not be overfished? What protection will be afforded? While one can appreciate the rationale behind the inclusion of commercially exploitable species, why should the regulations be extended to species currently not covered by exclusions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal touches on one of the fundamental changes the Bill will bring about in how we look after the conservation of wildlife in Ireland. The original Act excluded from its general scope all fish and aquatic invertebrate species. While this may been understandable in 1976, it would be completely at variance with the approach appropriate today when an eco-system or holistic approach to biodiversity conservation is being pursued. In practical terms, such an approach meant that tens of thousands of species from both marine and fish water eco-systems were, strictly speaking, off limits from any conservation consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill brings all wildlife, as well as wild plant species, within its scope, apart from certain species relevant to fisheries, whether commercial or recreational, which will be excluded. Section 32 contains a provision which provides for the exclusion of a species relevant to fisheries to be specified in regulations to be made under the section. The intention is that the species relevant to any type of fishery can be excluded by being listed in the regulations. Species listed are likely to be relevant to existing commercial fisheries and other types of fishing such as sport or recreational fishing, for example for coarse fish. Species not yet subject to commercial exploitation, but which are under consideration or the subject of trials to investigate the potential for exploitation or which may become so in the <Col N="868" /> future may be listed in the regulations. Limiting excludable species along the lines suggested by the Deputy to ones fit for commercial exploitation would be unduly restrictive and not in line with the intention behind the provision.</P>
    <P>The overall changes in the scope of the Bill to comprehend the vast majority of wild species represent a new departure for wildlife conservation. This broadening of the basis of wildlife legislation is of fundamental significance as it establishes a new and holistic framework within which the conservation of biodiversity can be addressed and advanced. The consultations with the Department took place long before Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 43, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) (i) in subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), by the insertion of the following after &lsquo;ditch':</P>
      <P>&lsquo;provided cutting is confined to strictly what is necessary for reasons of public health and safety', and</P>
      <P>(ii) in subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), by the insertion of the following after &lsquo;agriculture':</P>
      <P>&lsquo;provided cutting is confined to strictly what is necessary for reasons of public health and safety',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which was discussed on Committee Stage, relates to the protection of hedgerows. I acknowledge the move made by the Minister on Committee Stage in moving the date back from 1 April to 1 March, something which about everybody was very happy. It is, however, a matter of concern that agricultural and forestry works will be completely exempt within the period specified in the Bill. They should be subject to some restrictions and controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the recent flooding demonstrates, the removal of hedgerows can have devastating effects. Hedgerows and ditches are vital and are there for a very good reason. I am unhappy that for agricultural reasons somebody can interfere with, remove, cut or grub a hedgerow within the period specified. The amendment seeks to ensure that works on hedgerows and ditches would be <Col N="869" /> subject to the restriction, &ldquo;provided cutting is confined to strictly what is necessary for reasons of public health and safety&rdquo;. No one could object to this. There is a need for control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the tone of the amendment. What was the nature of the consultations which took place with the various interests involved? I am very conscious of the interests of those who are expert in the laying of hedges, a manual activity not mentioned explicitly in the Bill, which refers to the cutting, grubbing or destroying of vegetation. The laying of hedges is a manual activity which does not involve the same level of intrusion in a habitat, in terms of noise, as a tractor and flare. There is, however, a need for restrictions and perhaps a separate, more lenient period which would avoid the nesting season but would not last as long as the ban on cutting. Has the Minister taken account of this representation about which I have just heard or did she hear about it before now? Perhaps she would consider this issue in more detail when the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I participated in the Committee Stage debate on this issue. Genuine reasons exist for cutting hedges within the restricted period. The issue of the line of sight at road intersections would be a factor as would the encroachment of vegetation on narrow roads along which children travel to and from school. Public safety and the safety of children, in particular, are serious concerns. Some vegetation, such as giant hogweed, irritates the skin very badly and that must also be taken into account. We must strike a balance between what is cut and when it is cut and what constitutes public safety and public health concerns. Who will make these decisions?</P>
      <P>Deputy Clune's amendment seeks to restrict cutting according to its necessity for reasons of public health and safety. Will the Minister indicate whether the Bill contains any provision in regard to who will decide what is cut and who will monitor cutting activities? Can local authorities cut with impunity on health and safety grounds? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline the overall situation in regard to the cutting of vegetation, including hedgerows, during the breeding season. Section 40 of the principal Act restricted the destruction of vegetation or uncultivated land during the main breeding and nesting season for birds. I have introduced a number of changes in section 46 of the current Bill which will strengthen the Act's provisions, with a view to enhancing the role of this legislation in providing protection to hedgerows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enhanced protection will be provided to hedgerows during the nesting seasons by the unambiguous statement that the section prohibiting the cutting of vegetation during the specified period applies to hedgerows. Second, the period during which hedgerows and other vegetation may not be cut will be significantly <Col N="870" /> extended. Cutting will now commence on 1 March as opposed to 1 April, as was previously the case. Third, from now on, public bodies, including local authorities, will be limited to cutting hedges during the allowable period to situations where reasons of public health and safety apply. This will ensure that routine maintenance hedge cutting cannot occur during the nesting period. Fourth, where indiscriminate or excessive hedge cutting appears to have taken place during the breeding season, the Minister will now have the power to request details of such works from local authorities or other public bodies. The bodies concerned will be obliged to supply such information to the Minister, together with an explanation of the public health and safety factors involved. These amendments will considerably strengthen the role of the Wildlife Act in conserving hedgerows and I anticipate they will have an even broader effect through the adoption of a more positive approach to hedgerows and a need to conserve them.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the issue as to whether local authorities would be committing an offence if they cut a hedge during the prohibited period for reasons other than public health and safety was raised. I assure Deputies that local authorities would be committing an offence in such circumstances and, if found to be in breach of the Act, would be liable to penalties in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clune's amendment proposes that existing exemptions allowing hedge cutting for agriculture or forestry purposes should be limited to reasons of public health or safety. Such a course of action would be unduly restrictive and, moreover, could prove difficult to enforce in practice. The possibility also exists that it would lead to spurious complaints being made against individuals. It is preferable to highlight and promote the importance of hedgerows and to encourage their retention and conservation. In this way, we can build on the goodwill which exists among the farming and broader community in regard to hedgerows.</P>
    <P>A number of relevant initiatives are already in place and I intend to build on these. Relevant initiatives include ongoing consultations with the forest service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Coillte and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in addition to a significant measure for the conservation of hedgerows under REPS.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> The date of the breeding season has been brought forward from 1 April to 1 March and that is to be welcomed. We have witnessed massive rainfall in recent weeks as a result of climate change and the <i>El Nino</i> effect. These changes have resulted in changes in breeding habits. I had noticed that the breeding season was commencing in March or even February in some cases due to our mild winters. Our previous calculations were arrived at on the basis of a severe winter but, nowadays, we have mild weather in January and February as well as in May and June. Nature is topsy-turvy and we must constantly review our calculations.</P>
    <P>Environmentalists disagree on the number of times various wildlife species breed per annum. Will the Minister outline the definitive periods within which breeding occurs? Rabbits breed from the month of January onwards and probably breed up to six times a year. Certain species of bird breed up to four times a year. I used to think birds stopped breeding at the end of June but I am informed that they can continue breeding into July and August although that does not appear to be widespread. Climate change has resulted in extraordinary changes in nesting and breeding habits and I wonder whether we are capable of keeping pace with these changes.</P>
    <P>The issue of road safety and the need to curtail overgrowth was referred to. In the past, when local authorities had a sizeable workforce, people would go out with slash-hooks to scart hedges. Nowadays, mechanical cutters cut hedges back to the bone.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to hedge cutting during the summer months of June, July or August. When the growth becomes excessive there is a need to cut it back, but that must be done within reason. One of the explanations we received from Kilkenny and Laois County Councils was that they felt they had done what was needed, but it was done with mechanical cutters. I found it was excessive, and most students of nature would agree. That kind of work should be done by hand. Too much is being left to mechanical cutters which are cutting too deep and definitely infringing upon the nesting of birds. More care must be taken. In terms of road safety we know hedges will meet in the middle of roads unless they are cut, but that must be done in a proper manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that nobody here wants to compromise public safety in terms of hedge cutting. The difficulty is that public safety is used as an excuse for cutting which clearly has nothing to do with public safety &ndash; it is simply convenience in terms of the weather being fine and the machine being in the area. This is what we are up against and I hope we can address it through enforcement, which is at the bottom of many of these solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not had a reply from the Minister to the questions I asked about hedge laying. Although she did say it was important to emphasise edu<Col N="872" /> cation and awareness of the importance of hedges, which is laudable, to do so requires a far more proactive interest and involvement by her Department, local authorities and landowners in the welfare of hedges. They must be encouraged to serve their own self-interest in terms of stock proofing hedges, something which hedge laying, a very old tradition, can provide. I suggest this should also be raised with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development because under REPS hedge laying does not feature very largely while hedge cutting and fencing off hedges does feature. I ask the Minister that in taking account of this amendment, which I agree should be based on public health and safety in terms of cutting, to deal with the issue of hedge laying which is not mentioned and which should be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section we are trying to protect hedgerows. What the Minister is proposing does not apply to agriculture or forestry which seem to be completely exempt from the section. My amendment proposes that if works are not necessary for reasons relating to agriculture or forestry they should be done on the basis of being confined to what is strictly necessary for reasons of public health and safety. I do not think anybody is against work being done on the grounds of public health and safety. I accept the Minister has explained that local authorities are not exempt under the legislation. The fact that this does not apply to agriculture is slightly worrying. If we are serious about protecting hedgerows and ensuring wildlife is given the necessary space, there should be some way to address it in relation to agricultural works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be sensitivity in relation to how site cleaning is done. In the old days a billhook and a forked stick were used, and it was much more wildlife friendly. From what the Minister said I am still not clear who will act as referee and decide whether work is done appropriately in the interests of public health and safety. Has this provision been included because it sounds good? <Col N="873" /> Will Dúchas or the Minister's Department have the capacity to police it? They may receive complaints from the public who may write to the Department, but how effective will this be as a comprehensive measure for protecting hedgerows and breeding species?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, from now on public bodies, including local authorities, will be limited to cutting hedgerows during the allowable period to situations where reasons of public health and safety apply. Bodies which continue to cut hedges within that period will have to supply information to the Minister together with an explanation of the public health and safety factors involved. Therefore, it is not just a question of window dressing. We want to know and will seek the explanations.</P>
      <P>Regarding the difference between hedge cutting and hedge laying, we are specifically talking about hedge cutting. The question of hedge laying is very specific and the issues of maintaining hedges through laying or otherwise is covered by REPS and would come directly under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That is something the Deputy could take up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. My Department will consider covering the question of hedgerows in terms of advice and guidelines to the agencies with which we are in contact.</P>
      <P>We have been in consultation with a number of Departments, including the Department of the Environment and Local Government, about hedges and we are currently having discussions about the possibility of further provision and protection for hedgerows under planning law.</P>
      <P>Regarding consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, we can further examine how to approach the guidelines issued to farmers concerning hedgerows. We will also have the national heritage plan and the biodiversity plan which will be important in examining further measures to protect and conserve hedgerows.</P>
      <P>In regard to the issues raised by Deputies O'Shea and Deasy, obviously various bird species have different breeding seasons. Some breed relatively early. Some have only one brood while others can have two or three. The time provided for in the Bill covers the majority of species. When I spoke about this issue to NGOs in particular, Birdwatch Ireland was happy with the restricted period proposed in the Bill and particularly with the amendment I proposed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware that in Britain in recent years a specific hedgerow Bill was introduced. Alluding to what Deputy Sargent has said, I think we should do <Col N="874" /> likewise here. The reason for it in England was that cereal growers were eliminating fences and hedgerows. Where there were many ten and 15 acre fields suddenly there were 100 and 200 acres of land to facilitate people growing cereals. There is the same tendency here although it is not as widespread because the country is so windswept and better protection is needed. In the eastern part of the country there is a tendency to eliminate many hedgerows and fences. We need a hedgerows Bill to stop the elimination of these fences and hedgerows. About seven or eight months ago, a farmer in Britain who eliminated hedgerows which were, perhaps, 200 or 300 years old was made to replace them. He was prosecuted and got a substantial fine and was made to replace the hedgerows precisely as they had been prior to removal. We should face up to the fact that we are getting rid of hedgerows. I do not think we have the manpower to prevent it. Despite the vigilance by the Department and local authorities it is happening wholesale under our noses.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the planning laws and she is in discussion with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I am pleased she is doing something to ensure our hedgerows are protected. She has an ideal opportunity in this Bill to address the issue particularly as it relates to agriculture. As Deputy Deasy has outlined that is the area where we need to have some protection in place. I am concerned that agriculture is exempt from this legislation. It is essential to include words similar to those proposed in my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 43, line 45, to delete &ldquo;statute;',&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;statute;</P>
      <P>(cc) the clearance of vegetation in the course of fisheries development works carried out by the Central Fisheries Board or a regional fisheries board in the exercise of its functions under the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1999;',&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 40 of the Principal Act, as amended by section 46 of the Bill, prohibits the destruction of vegetation during the period from 1 March to 31 August. The Bill limited the exemption allowed to public bodies to cases where cutting of vegetation is necessary for reasons of public health and safety. In the course of discussions which my officials have undertaken with the various parties on the overall hedgerows and vegetation issues since Committee Stage, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has raised concerns that the new limitation being placed on this <Col N="875" /> exemption would significantly restrict the necessary activity of fishery boards in relation to the management and conservation of fisheries. In practice certain works involving the clearance of vegetation for fisheries conservation or angling requirements can only be carried out by the fishery boards during the period March to August. It is simply not possible to undertake such works outside of this period as the main growth of vegetation only occurs after 1 March. Situations where it is necessary to clear vegetation during this period include the carrying out of works aimed at conserving fish populations or works to enable certain types of angling to take place. Therefore, I am proposing amendment No. 23 which will ensure that such necessary works can be carried out by the Central Fisheries Board or the regional fisheries board. In general such works by fishery boards do not adversely affect wildlife. On the contrary, their purpose is frequently to improve fish populations or their habitats thereby contributing to the conservation of biodiversity.</P>
    <P>I refer Deputies to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999. Sections 5 and 8 of that Act outline the functions of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fishery boards respectively. The Act provides that the fishery boards in the performance of their functions must have regard to the conservation of fish, other flora, habitats and biodiversity and must ensure that their activities protect the natural heritage as far as possible. These are powers which are invested in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, subsequent to a request from me to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources that the functions of the fishery boards should include providing for biodiversity conservation. Therefore, under fisheries legislation the functions of the fisheries board require them not only to act in a manner which safeguards wildlife but to also address wildlife and biodiversity conservation needs in carrying out their activities. Furthermore, in order to enhance the role played by fishery board and wildlife conservation on the ground I have agreed with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources that guidelines concerning fishery boards' activities and wildlife conservation will be drawn up between the boards and Dúchas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 44, lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;The Minister may request from the person concerned&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The person concerned shall provide to the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The substance of the Bill allows the Minister to carry out a spot-check effectively where the law may have been broken in relation to hedge cutting or any other type of work which we have discussed today. That is inadequate. We discussed this matter on Committee Stage. At that time the Minister made the point that it would be too much for the Department if everybody who has been involved in carrying out works was to provide the Minister with information. I accept that to a point. I presume it is a question of resources when we refer to that matter. Following on from Committee Stage I understood there was an acceptance of the need for local authorities to maintain a database or some readily available information on when work was carried out during the restricted period.</P>
      <P>Rather than it appearing that some hedge was cut down on a certain road or in a certain place and looking for a spot-check on that particular incident, the Minister could seek the body of knowledge the local authority has about its cutting operations, which would be required to be kept by the local authority. It could still be a spot-check but it would be a far more comprehensive spot-check. It would show a trend or pattern if there was a need to follow up, and if illegal cutting was taking place it would be far more apparent from such a database than from a single operation. As the next part of the section states, it could be used as a good defence that it was necessary for the purpose of saving life, preventing fire or any other outstanding reason. If each local authority was required to hold a database containing the times at which cutting took place, it might quickly become clear that cutting during restricted periods, which is not in compliance with the Act, tends to take place when the weather is fine. If one had a Meteorological Office record and a record of indiscriminate cutting, one would find that cutting took place when the man on the tractor got a bit carried away because the weather was fine and he had his mind on something else, or else he just did not care in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should look more closely at what she can do to protect hedges, rather than simply requesting the person concerned for any details about the incident. We should be able to find more information that that. If the Minister will not accept my amendment, given that she did not accept it on Committee Stage, she might examine the possibility of improving her own approach to the subject by making it clear that local authorities have to maintain a log of cutting within the <Col N="877" /> restricted period, for whatever reason they may have.</P>

      <P>That is fair enough, thank you. With regard to amendments Nos. 24 and 25, the proposal put forward by Deputy Sargent that all public bodies should provide me with continuous reports on ongoing hedge-cutting and clearance of vegetation, is not altogether practical. It is neither necessary nor advisable. It is not just a question of resources within the Department; the principle is not one we should follow. In cases where there is cause for concern, I can request the relevant bodies to supply me with the relevant information. It is my intention to monitor the effectiveness of this provision over time and, if necessary, it will be open to me to take such measures.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies with regard to the concerns they have expressed about the way local authorities deal with hedgerows. I have already outlined that the Bill would limit hedge cutting by local authorities, during the relevant period, to situations where this is necessary for public health and safety. This is more than a cosmetic change and I intend to ensure it will bring about real change in practices. More generally, it should bring about a new recognition of the importance of protecting hedgerows and a realisation that they cannot be damaged without good reason. In requesting explanations to justify any such cutting actions within the season, I will be in a position to take legal action if necessary. Penalties for local authorities will apply, as for any other party outside the health and safety area. I am pursuing with the Department of the Environment and Local Government the possibility of taking other measures to provide for the conservation of hedgerows under the new planning regulations to be made under the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I am also considering measures in the course of preparation under the National Biodiversity Plan and the National Heritage Plan.</P>
      <P>I will certainly discuss the database issue further with the Department of the Environment and Local Government to see how we can progress the matter. However, I cannot give a commitment at this stage other than to say that we are having discussions and will examine all the relevant issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a basic weakness in the legislation and I can see Deputy Sargent's viewpoint <Col N="878" /> arising from the amendments he has moved. The matters in question include the clearance of vegetation in the course of road or other construction work, or in the development or preparation of sites on which any building or any other structure is intended to be provided. This is not like the NHAs which would have become part of the county development plan. How does the Minister find out about somebody who, let us say, is clearing a site for construction? The person may very well have planning permission to clear a site. The Minister presented this as being a matter for public bodies, but further down in the legislation there is a reference to &ldquo;a person&rdquo; or &ldquo;the person concerned&rdquo;. If an individual or a local authority is clearing a site, for which all the necessary permission has been obtained, to build a water pumping station or local authority housing, how will the Minister's Department and Dúchas know that something has happened or is about to happen? I am afraid that one will only become aware of these events when it is too late.</P>
      <P>In my area there is a referral process with the county council whereby any application that comes in must be referred for a sites and monuments statement. It is referred to Dúchas and the applicant for planning permission may have to engage the services of an archaeologist to deal with such things. My difficulty concerns the communication aspect. How will the Minister know about many of the areas that would come within the ambit of the definition concerning the removal of vegetation? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister is taking up the issue of database compilation or retention with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I hope also that she has impressed upon the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and their respective Departments, the responsibilities they have as custodians of hedgerows, and also as legislators.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of damage is being done in the hope it will not be discovered. Sometimes, the removal of hedgerows is done in a very underhand manner, under cover of darkness or at weekends. I can provide instances of where hedges have been removed by a developer who did not have permission but was anxious to display his new houses to best advantage for passing traffic. He regarded the hedgerow as an interference with his business plan. There are many incidents like that one where the local authority needs the Minister's support in stating that a database is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such actions must be put in writing so that the person who committed the offence and the reason he or she committed it will be on record the day the offence is committed. It is an important contribution to the awareness of which the Minister spoke earlier as well as the practical protection of hedges if people believe a penalty, traceability and accountability are involved and <Col N="879" /> not simply a spot check here and there. It will get as bad a reputation as litter legislation if people believe the legislation will not be enforced. I hope the Minister will pursue through the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the matter of the database with the local authorities from which I hope we will see an improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly my intention to monitor the effectiveness of the provision over time and it is open to me to take measures to improve the effectiveness, if necessary. I reiterate that I will discuss the question of the database with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>As regards who will report and be our eyes and ears in this respect, we hope that the information will come to us through our local personnel in Dúchas and the public. Where there have been problems with local authorities, it would not be surprising that we would be more vigilant in watching those cases. If it came to notice that an authority had been in breach, it would be watched very carefully from there on.</P>
      <P>The creation of a situation where there is a general spirit of interest and knowledge through education of the importance of our hedgerows will also help in that the further education of the importance of this issue will mean that there will be further interest from the general public. No doubt it, in turn, will show greater interest and report any such cases it believes we should be aware of. From the outset, local personnel will be of great importance and be an important link helping us monitor the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the direction in which the Minister is going. I hope it will result in much more support for those personnel in local authorities who are extremely frustrated at the lack of interest and enforcement when it comes to breaches of conditions attached to planning permissions which have resulted in hedges being removed wholesale. Their efforts are being frustrated because each incident is a single one and, there are so many of them, they generally go unrecorded.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to know, if the Minister rang a local authority, whether she would be able to obtain a calendar of incidents where hedge removal was discovered, be it by the local authority, land owners, developers or others trying to circumvent or test the law. I support the Minister in making strong representations to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I hope there will be a stronger protection of hedgerows with that co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 47, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) by the insertion of the following after paragraph (<i>b</i>):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(<i>c</i>) any maintenance on any existing land drainage scheme within the meaning of the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1995,',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment I hope to address the issue of existing drainage systems and wetlands. I know that, since the 1976 Wildlife Act, it has been necessary for the Office of Public Works to carry out environmental impact assessments for new arterial drainage schemes. However, it is work to existing schemes I hope to address in this amendment so that any maintenance on any existing land drainage scheme or any drainage scheme within the meaning of the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1995, will be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works should be required to consult the Minister prior to undertaking any maintenance or work on these schemes, especially if they are adjacent to an NHA or a special area of conservation, SAC. It is a delicate process and some works could interfere with and be detrimental to these drainage schemes. The thrust of my argument is to ensure that existing drainage schemes are mentioned in the Bill and that there is an obligation on the Office of Public Works to report to the Minister when any works in or near such schemes take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is similar to Deputy Clune's. It is an attempt to include existing drainage schemes so that the anomaly between existing and new schemes is removed. An existing scheme is often worked on and radically changed. It is very important not just for wildlife but also for the general monitoring of hydrology and general water flows in any area to be conscious of work being carried out, regardless of whether the drainage scheme is existing or new. Sometimes the difference is academic.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister accepts the spirit of these amendments. We do not have to be reminded and it is to the forefront of everyone's minds at the moment that one person's drainage scheme is another person's flood. It is important that the monitoring of drainage schemes is not simply restricted to new schemes. I hope this amendment, which attempts to provide a level playing pitch, if that is the right phrase, for drainage, can be part of the Bill. I hope the Minister accepts the spirit of the amendment, whatever about its wording. We look forward to her reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments proposed by Deputies Clune and Sargent would oblige the <Col N="881" /> Office of Public Works to consult the Minister prior to carrying out any maintenance work on existing arterial drainage schemes. Most such drainage schemes are in place for many years and any ongoing works are necessary to avoid flooding. The imposition at this stage of legal requirements on works or schemes already sanctioned would be both inappropriate and unnecessary. It is also probable that the passage of these amendments would necessitate the revision of arterial drainage legislation.</P>
      <P>More generally, schemes being examined or undertaken under the 1995 Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act deal in the main with localised urban flooding. All wildlife and environmental considerations are assessed in the development of these schemes and they are also subject to a consultation process. Furthermore, every new arterial drainage scheme must go through a public exhibition process prior to confirmation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It should be appreciated that, while isolated wildlife problems have arisen with regard to drainage maintenance, the overall position is not widely problematic. In general, drainage maintenance does not have a significant adverse effect on wildlife. On the other hand, a recent independent review of drainage found that the economic benefits of drainage maintenance to be considerable. Our current weather conditions bear out the importance of drainage works. The matter is best addressed through consultation and agreement to address any potential problems.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee comprising representatives of my Department and the Office of Public Works has been set up to deal with wildlife issues involved in drainage work. This committee has been very successful in preventing problems and resolving difficulties when they arise. I intend to continue with the successful co-operation which is a practical approach and is the most appropriate mechanism for dealing with any wildlife issues arising from drainage maintenance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>How can existing drainage schemes adjacent to or near an existing or proposed NHA be protected? As it stands, any works can be done on the drainage scheme, although it might be adjacent to the protected area and have some impact on it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said works on existing drainage schemes will not affect wildlife, but they could at times of flooding. Deputy Sargent referred to the flooding last weekend. It will be very difficult in many cases to get to the root cause of flooding. However, interfering with drainage schemes can have a detrimental effect on other areas. What protection does the Minister have in place for existing drainage schemes to ensure they will not have an effect on wildlife, NHAs or protected areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's reply, particularly when she said the effect of drainage on wildlife was not significant. <Col N="882" /> That is a very interesting comment. I look forward in years to come to reading it in the record because it might be a little like reading the debates on Ardnacrusha in the early 1920s, when it was felt that scheme was too grandiose and excessive. That scheme now supplies only 1% of our electricity needs. Times change and the flooding patterns are getting worse. I am a member of the Shannon flooding subcommittee of the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport and we see a pattern there.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister said the drainage schemes are not significant, I believe they are going to become more and more significant. It probably will not be possible to solve the flooding problem by digging a deeper drain. However, the sensitivities in coping with wildlife interests and water flow, in general, need to be taken much more seriously.</P>
      <P>The point of these amendments is to ensure we are not omitting the monitoring of existing arterial drainage. The machinery used in drainage works nowadays is far bigger than that used before because contractors want to get a certain amount of work done. It is no longer the case that such work requires a lot of physical effort because these machines can move an enormous amount of earth in a very short time. The widening or deepening of an existing drain often amounts to the creation of a new drain, in terms of the amount of work.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister can take that into account and take advice on this before the Bill is debated in the Seanad. Drainage goes far beyond the Minister's responsibilities. Wildlife is our main concern here, but we are talking about far more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also concerned about wildlife but there are two sides to the story. I have very practical experience of dealing with this problem in the south Galway area, which floods on a regular basis. Controlled drainage is a help to wildlife rather than a hindrance. Drainage can be controlled now.</P>
      <P>Many flooding problems in south Galway and other areas are caused by the fact that water levels have changed because of the building of roads. Local authorities are responsible for keeping roads free for traffic, so their only responsibility is to raise the road where flooding occurs. Raising the road where flooding occurs every year simply creates flooding in another area because it stops the water taking its natural course across the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no effect on wildlife if winter turloughs are maintained at their winter levels. It is only when winter turloughs are not controlled at their winter level that there is an effect on wildlife. In spring, wildlife hatch on the high water mark of winter turloughs. When flooding occurs in the spring and those high water marks are driven far into agricultural land, swans, ducks and others hatch at the high water mark, which is then in fields. The wildlife are then destroyed by foxes <Col N="883" /> and other vermin. My contention is that allowing drainage to control the water at winter turlough level will enhance the chances of wildlife rather than affecting it, while relieving the excessive flooding which is causing great trouble throughout the country now and every second or third year in my area.</P>
    <P>It must be asked whether the rights of wildlife are overruling those of human life. Is it better to put people out of their homes as a result of flooding or to risk affecting some wildlife by providing drainage that will allow people stay in their homes?</P>
    <P>All those drainage schemes can be controlled by road level crossings. No matter what drainage scheme is in place in a rural area, it must go past a road. If the road crossing level is engineered to keep the water at the winter turlough level, there will be no effect on wildlife in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has just said, we are talking here about maintenance of existing schemes. His logic seems to be at variance with the amendment tabled by Deputy Clune. The reason I gave for not being able to accept that amendment was that the drainage schemes that have been in place for many years require ongoing works to avoid flooding. In general, drainage maintenance does not have significant adverse effects on wildlife.</P>
      <P>Through the interdepartmental group, we have successfully addressed many potential problems, prevented many problems arising and resolved difficulties when they arise. This is the best possible approach to deal with issues which are obviously of great concern, particularly to those living in areas where flooding can occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has nailed her colours to the mast on this amendment, which is a matter of regret to me. To my mind, the Bill is incomplete if &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; is to be understood as meaning maintaining exactly what is there. In reality, &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; can be a euphemism for very large jobs. I do not think that is being taken into account. Maintenance can change drainage much more than the changes to which Deputy McCormack alluded. That must be monitored. One land owner may be clearing land and that could result in flooding elsewhere.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Maintenance&rdquo; is a wide-ranging term. It can be widely interpreted and what we mean by it should be clarified. In terms of foreign affairs, maintaining peace can mean anything from walking down a street in a police uniform to bombing a place into submission.</P>

    <P>This matter was raised on Committee Stage. The amendment seeks to improve the Bill which states:</P>

    <P>While I am not disputing the Minister's expertise in understanding the ecology and behaviour of wildlife, it would be more objective and in keeping with the nature of the Bill if instead of &ldquo;as the Minister thinks fit&rdquo; the section read &ldquo;according to the best established ecological and humane practices and principles&rdquo;. If people were arguing with the Minister I would prefer if she were in a position to say the decision was based on best advice as opposed to the opinion of the Minister at the time.

      <P>The form of words proposed by the Deputy is neither required or appropriate. The aim of the Bill is to protect and conserve our wildlife and natural heritage. It would go completely against this aim for the Minister to instruct that a protected wild bird or mammal, having been captured unintentionally, be released or disposed of in a way that is inhumane or ecologically unfriendly. I do not envisage that any Minister would give such a direction. All the functions exercised by the Minister under wildlife legislation must take into account wildlife conservation considerations.

    <P>This amendment is technical in nature and is completed on the advice of the Attorney General's office. On completion of Committee Stage it was noticed that the title of the subsection should more properly read &ldquo;subsection (4)&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;subsection (3)(<i>a</i>)&rdquo;. This amendment will also clarify that the provisions of section 64 will not restrict prosecution under the Customs Acts of any offence committed under section <Col N="886" /> 53(<i>a</i>) and not just offences committed under section 53(<i>a</i>)(4)(<i>b</i>).</P>
    <P>Legal advice has been obtained to the effect that the original wording would have been too restrictive.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32: </P>
      <P>In page 71, to delete lines 13 to 21 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and </P>

      <P>(<i>b</i>)in the case of a second such offence, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, and</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)in the case of a third or subsequent such offence, to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds'f5&gt;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is to remove any soft options regarding offences committed under the Wildlife Acts. A major concern is that, under the Bill as worded, a person could get off lightly on a first offence. The Minister amended this section on Committee Stage. Under subsection (1) the Bill, before being amended, stated the maximum fine was £50 and it did not provide for a prison sentence. For a second offence the fine was £100 and no prison sentence. For a third offence it was £200 and, again, no prison sentence. The Minister introduced a new maximum fine in relation to a first offence of £500 or three months' imprisonment or both; £1,000 or six months' imprisonment or both for a second offence and £5,000 or 12 months' imprisonment or both on conviction for a third offence. I am seeking a maximum fine of £1,500 for all offences or a term not exceeding 12 months in prison, or both. I do not see any reason those fines and terms of imprisonment could not apply to all offences as a judge will still have discretion as to what fines to impose. Leaving it open strengthens the legislation. What I propose will act as a greater deterrent and offences will not occur. These penalties apply afterwards. I hope the Minister accepts the amendment. It provides that for first, second or third offences the maximum fine will be £1,500 and the maximum prison sentence will be 12 months.</P>

      <P>Section 68 will amend and add further to section 74 of the principal Act which sets out the penalties in the case of a conviction under either the principal Act or the amendment Act. I will explain the reasons this revision is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, the financial penalties which were laid down in 1976 need to be <Col N="887" /> increased. A person convicted of what might be termed an ordinary offence under the Act, for example, would have been liable to a fine of up to £50. The amending legislation increases this potential fine for a first time offence to £500. There are similar level increases in respect of second or third offences and the maximum penalty in respect of a conviction for an ordinary offence under the Wildlife Acts will now be £1,500 and or imprisonment for 12 months.</P>
    <P>For what might be termed more serious offences including, for example, damage to NHAs, the penalties proposed are obviously stiffer. The penalty for a summary conviction in respect of an offence of this type is a fine of £1,500 and or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months. The penalty for a conviction on indictment is a possible fine of up to £50,000 and-or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. The maximum penalty for a similar offence under the 1976 Act was a possible fine of £500. For the first time there is provision in this legislation for a term of imprisonment on conviction of an offence. This combined with the heavy financial penalties now being put in place will, with the other measures introduced in the Bill, serve to enhance greatly the protection and conservation of our important habitats and our wildlife generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea's amendment would do away with the current graduated system of penalties for ordinary offences under the legislation. My proposal to maintain the graduated system of penalties for ordinary offences, as has been the case under the principal Act, is based on the advice of the Attorney General's office. This advice was that it would generally be inappropriate to have the same level of penalties for first offences as for repeat offences. This is a view with which I concur.</P>
    <P>There are potentially many circumstances arising under the wildlife legislation where an individual, through an oversight or a lack of knowledge of the legislation, might commit a relatively minor offence. If this happens on one occasion, it would be unreasonable to impose on that individual a significant fine, possibly £1,500, and-or 12 months imprisonment as would be the case under the Deputy's proposal. A £500 fine and-or a three month term of imprisonment, as proposed in my amendment, represents an appropriate punishment. If the same individual were to commit a further offence under this subsection, under the graduated system the offender would be potentially liable to increased fines when a defence based upon ignorance of the legislation would not carry as much weight. On the third conviction the fine would be equivalent to that imposed on summary conviction of a more serious offence under the Acts.</P>
    <P>Under the Deputy's proposed amendment such an offender on conviction following a first offence would be immediately liable to a fine of up to £1,500. While I believe a penalty of this level is <Col N="888" /> appropriate for more serious offences, such as a breach of a NHA order or an offence involving protected species, I do not see how this can be treated the same as a comparatively insignificant offence. Hence my acceptance of the advice of the Attorney General to retain the graduated system that is already in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's arguments are not convincing. At the end of the day, the penalties imposed are at the discretion of the court. We are dealing with ceilings, as it were. I am seeking a ceiling of a £1,500 fine and-or 12 months imprisonment in respect of first, second or third ordinary offences. If a person is guilty of a relatively minor offence or a substantial defence could be mounted on the basis of a lack of knowledge, we should be able to trust the Judiciary to deal with it appropriately in terms of penalties.</P>
      <P>The issue is to have the ceilings high enough to act as a deterrent. What we want to achieve with these penalties is that the first offence does not happen. The Minister has made up her mind on this and her legal advice does not coincide with my view on how the matter should be handled. I will withdraw the amendment but I ask the Minister to look at it again before bringing the legislation to the Seanad. What is being implied is that the graduated system, the penalties for which have been strengthened in this legislation, is needed to ensure that judges impose appropriate penalties. I believe the Judiciary is more prudent. It does not follow that inappropriate penalties will be imposed under the amendment or that the existence of a graduated system will result in only appropriate penalties being imposed.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and I am aware of the Deputy's strong views on it. However, the Deputy is correct that I am adamant on this point. I have given it a great deal of thought. It is most important to update the fines and provide for imprisonment but the graduation system is important for a number of reasons. For example, although a person could be sentenced to prison for what could be termed an ordinary offence, I do not envisage it being utilised in the majority of cases. We must ensure there is legislation that will act as the deterrent which the Deputy is seeking. However, I believe the best approach is through the graduated system I am proposing.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in thanking the Minister for the opportunity to debate this Bill at long last. She is aware that since I was elected to this House in 1992 I have sought the introduction of this legislation. It is a great pleasure to know it is on its way, but I urge the Minister to take up the points regarding its enforcement. Legislation is only as good as its enforcement. I appreciate her points about the necessity to ensure wider coverage of biodiversity and wildlife issues as well as the enforcement of the legislation. I hope she will add to that trend and I urge her to favourably consider the Irish Seal Sanctuary, which is doing great work and providing considerable education and awareness of wildlife issues. It seems to have come up against closed doors in its requests for assistance from the Government. This Bill presents an opportunity to show bona fides in that area.</P>
      <P>As well as our having a role in protecting wildlife, there is much we can learn from wildlife. Many species of wildlife have much to teach us in terms of organisation. While ants are small creatures, their social structures could teach us more about co-operation than our own species who seem to be obsessed with competition.</P>
      <P>The ability of the swallow to fly around the earth five times in its 11 year lifespan or to take three months to fly 6,000 miles to South Africa shows enormous endeavour, persistence and determination, traits which humans value. We are humbled by the awesome majesty of species such as the right whale, which when born weighs a tonne and as an adult weighs 60 tonnes. These facts keep us humble as a species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is out of character to talk of protection and awareness of the natural world against the background of carted stag hunting, an issue with which the Minister must deal. To refer to certain species, such as foxes, as vermin, as some colleagues did, is not in the spirit of this Bill. The Bill is <Col N="890" /> about valuing the place of every creature in the eco-system, which is ours to protect and of which we are a part. The Minister said she is concerned about the extinction and protection of species of our wildlife. It is a short step between a species being supposedly plentiful and widespread to it being extinct. We have only to reflect on our past when the golden eagle and wolf became extinct. We still talk about keeping the wolf from the door. Those species are part of our psyche and our culture, but they are now extinct. I hope this Bill will enable us to look to the future to ensure we protect that downward trend and our diminishing biodiversity, which poses a danger for us. I wish the Minister well in countering that trend.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>: </b>When I spoke on the Bill previously I referred to the service the VHI has provided, the scarcity of nurses, the demand for speech therapists who are being lured away from this country because of the low wages they are paid, the delay in obtaining treatment, especially MRI scans and brain scans, experienced by public health patients. In the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's absence, I said that on one occasion I was lucky to receive excellent advice from him. I acknowledge, in his presence, his help in allowing me to continue with more ráiméis here today.</P>
      <P>In addressing health insurance, the necessary facilities must be in place. I mentioned the havoc in hospitals due to the scarcity of nurses. Since I last spoke on the Bill, a State enrolled nurse &ndash; a nurse who has completed two years' training &ndash; approached me regarding the issue of training. One year training courses are run in England to bring trainee nurses up to the standard of a State registered nurse or its equivalent, at which stage they can take up nursing posts. Some trainee nurses pursuing that training course must pay between £6,000 and £10,000 depending on the time they have to spend abroad and whether they can get accommodation with a relative, etc. A group of 30 trainee nurses are participating in such a training course. Those trainee nurses will be qualified to take up nursing posts in a year. There are approximately 3,000 State enrolled nurses here, although not all of them are free to return to nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to a parliamentary question I tabled regarding the course in England and the provision of financial aid for those participating in it, the Minister said that while he was not in a position to provide funds to assist enrolled nurses working in the Irish public health service in non-nursing capacities to undertake that course, he <Col N="891" /> intends to explore with An Bord Altranais and other relevant bodies whether it would be possible to deliver such a course here.  While I am not referring to the Minister, there seems to be no forward planning or thinking in this area in the Department of Health and Children. If courses have been run under the English system for such a period that Irish trainee nurses are enrolling in them, why have we not copped on to that, sent our experts to England to investigate it and set up a course here when there is such a demand for nurses? What is there to investigate with An Bord Altranais when this course exists in England? Why are we not grasping the opportunity to set up a similar course here?  </P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, was present when I raised another matter on the Adjournment. I tabled three parliamentary questions regarding help for those suffering from attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder. Because of the gobbledegook answers I got, I raised it on the Adjournment and expressed my delight that a medical doctor was present to reply to it and that I expected he would not read out gobbledegook, but he did. He said the Department will do A, B, C, and D. The person from Carlow on whose behalf I raised this matter went to Canada and to London at her own expense and found systems of treatment there that work. From my experience in the classroom when I was not aware of ADD, I thought young lads who could not control their impulses and were not quiet in class tended to get into trouble and end up in jail. Why can we not ensure such children have access to the necessary treatment? When I raised this matter on the Adjournment, I got three pages of a reply about health boards. The health boards should be abolished because they are used as an excuse for pretending we deliver a service that does not exist. The mother, to whom I referred, went to Canada and to England. She knows the cause of her children's difficulties, yet we have no facility for helping such children. It is disappointing there is not a think tank in the Department to plan ahead and deal with matters, such as training for nurses and the treatment of ADD and ADDHD that other countries have mastered. That should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question on the delay in the provision of hearing aids, to which I got a reply today. These seems to be no problem with providing them in two months, three months or four months. I tabled this question on behalf of a 90 year old constituent who told me that when he applied for medical aid he was told it would take 12 months for him to be seen by the ENT consultant. That was enough to knock him over, although there was a sensible senior official in the South Eastern Health Board who said that nonsense must be stopped. The concept was that this man would wait a year to be told by a consultant that he was deaf. One would not need a consult<Col N="892" /> ant to know this man was deaf; one would know it from talking to him. That was left out.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the answers we get are as clear as they might be, as this man's case was not an exception. There is a long waiting list for consultants' appointments and I am not satisfied that some of these services are as up to date as they appear to be.</P>
    <P>Regarding treatment for ADD, the last reply I received stated:</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering whether there may be a case for the further development of the adult psychiatric services in this regard. However, the development of appropriate services for children is a priority and, as I have outlined, that is being addressed by my Department at present.</P>
    <P>The statement that &ldquo;there may be a case for the further development of the adult psychiatric services in this regard&rdquo; is dreadful. Two different consultants dealt with this person. He told one of them when in jail that he suffered from ADD and needed help and he was told by the consultant, &ldquo;We all suffer from ADD&rdquo;. The other consultant said he should go to England because people like that all finished up in jail. Those were consultant psychiatrists.</P>
    <P>The Minister says his Department is considering whether there may be a case for the further development of the adult psychiatric services in this regard, but there is no doubt that it is time a group of specialists in the Department should be nominated to visit Canada or England to catch up with the medical practices there. It is appalling that we are just now thinking of doing something in this area when we should have services in place. It is bad enough to have an ailment that does not respond to treatment but it is awful when one has an ailment and people do not know what one is talking about, particularly when that ailment may mean one ends up in jail. Then, when one is in jail somebody masquerading as a consultant psychiatrist says everyone suffers from ADD. If one of my family members were involved I would take drastic action.</P>
    <P>The Department will have to come to life and get a research unit going to stay up to date on this issue; it should be ahead of other countries instead of being left behind on such serious matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It copperfastens certain aspects of private health insurance, which is very welcome given that so many people depend on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first issue is community rating, where insurers set and charge their customers the same price irrespective of their age, sex, health status, prospective health status or medical history. This is a large part of the reason young people have taken up private health insurance in such numbers and without quibbling about the costs. They know that in the future, as they get older, that they will get the benefit of it at the same price as <Col N="893" /> when they entered the system at the beginning, except of course for inflation costs. There is also the issue of open enrolment, which means that insurers must accept people of any age or health status without any penalty. That gives great confidence to people when they get to the stage where they can afford private health insurance. When they reach 25 or 35 and feel they can afford private health insurance they can afford to do so without penalty.</P>
    <P>Lifetime cover gives great security to people, particularly those getting on in years, as they know that if they join a health insurance company at a young age, whether that is under 30 or under 60, that they can continue with that cover for the rest of their lives. The feeling of security is very important to people as they get older, particularly our senior citizens. Minimum benefits, which must be given by insurance companies, cover stays in hospital and most of the medical costs.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the effort the VHI has put into developing private health insurance. It has made a phenomenal contribution and has given great peace of mind to its 1.5 million subscribers. I have been a member of the VHI for many years and I have always felt the charge to me and my family was reasonable. The VHI set the scene with regard to community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. Its package was comprehensive, with plan A, plan B and so on. Plan B was the most widely used plan in the system and one felt very comfortable with it.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the work done by BUPA since entering the market. It has brought competition to the market and the synergy between BUPA and the VHI has brought the number of people using private health insurance up to 46% or 47% of the population. It was good for consumers to have an alternative which could match the products already on offer from VHI; the product was similar because the Government was determined that there would be a package of comprehensive minimum benefits. BUPA helped to increase the market dramatically by creating that awareness and also improved the product range, as there are subtle differences between the schemes that are available. BUPA's essential and essential plus schemes are broadly similar to the plan B schemes of the VHI, but there are small differences which give people a choice.</P>
    <P>The fairness of risk equalisation is a big problem in the Bill. Some companies say that without risk equalisation effective risk rating will come about. Risk rating means that those between 20 and 30 will get a lower premium because the risk of them getting sick is lower than for those between 60 and 70, who would pay a far greater premium. We do not want that here; everyone is agreed that we want community rating. We want the same premium paid by the 20 year old and the 50 year old. It has worked well for us in the past and I see no reason why it will not work well for us into the future. If there was no risk equalisation young people would be attracted to companies coming into the market to charge a lower <Col N="894" /> rate. The concept of risk equalisation, where companies which have a huge preponderance of people who are liable to have large claims, should be levelled out by companies that are not likely to have a preponderance of large claims because of the age distribution among their clients.</P>
    <P>It was implied to me that the full cost of the C, D and E schemes would be included in the costs to be equalised. Another source informed me, however, that only plan B content of the VHI's C, D and E schemes would be included in cost equalisation. This is important and I see some merit in this process if only that the plan B content will be equalised in respect of the entire population.</P>
    <P>In addition to equalising the costs and giving a greater amount of money to the company with the larger number of high cost clients, one must consider the administration expenses incurred by these companies. If we consider a company with 1.5 million customers and another with 180,000 customers, there is no doubt the administration expenses per customer will be significant in respect of the company with the smaller customer base. Unless we help the company with the higher administration costs <i>per capita </i>in some way, it will not be able to develop its presence in the marketplace and provide the type of service offered by the larger company. Effectively, there would be a subsidy from the smaller company to its larger counterpart which would not be fully warranted in terms of cost equalisation because the smaller company's administrative costs would be far greater. This matter must be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>I do not know the administration expenses of the VHI or BUPA. However, if the VHI's expenses are £10 million I have no doubt BUPA's expenses are at least £3 million to £4 million. In light of their customer bases, BUPA's costs are considerably larger in proportion to those of the VHI. I agree with the concept of risk equalisation but it must be tempered by taking account of the other items of expense of the companies involved.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the incidence of diabetes type 2. I recently visited the diabetes day centre at St. James's Hospital which is an inspiring place. The care and attention being given by the doctors and nurses working in the centre is phenomenal. I was extremely impressed by what I saw. Following my visit I received a visit from one of the consultants who stated:</P>
    <P>I know you are aware of the &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; of Type 2 diabetes . . . our new patient referrals (mainly with Type 2 diabetes) have increased year-on-year by about 40% in both of the past two years. This is a huge problem. Many of these newer patients are middle-aged or young people, working &ndash; with young families . . . all speciality areas continue to clamour for Government support &ndash; diabetes is a genuine area of need with potential to prevent cardiovascular disease in young people in particular . . . we need to increase the profile of this disease, and bring it into the mainstream of the <Col N="895" /> hospital, and Irish medicine . . . It has been shown very clearly that the costs of good diabetes care and preventive medicine is much less than the cost of treating patients with complications, particularly cardiovascular disease.</P>
    <P>My purpose in quoting from this letter is to bring this matter to the fore in the hope that the Minister might take action in respect of it.</P>
    <P>I am vice-chairman of St. James's Hospital and I can state that the Minister recently gave approval for a significant development of its accident and emergency facilities. The hospital serves a significant area of Dublin which is home to many senior citizens and elderly people. The accident and emergency unit at St. James's, like other hospitals, is over-stretched. I am delighted the new multi-million pound facility is expected to be in operation before next winter because it will help to improve matters dramatically.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill deals with a number of issues. The first of these involves the section which retains the provision requiring insurers to operate significant premium costs in respect of children. It is good for people with either the VHI or BUPA to know that they can include their children on their health insurance at a reasonable cost. I welcome the fact that the age at which the lower price premium will cease to apply to students will increase from 21 to 23 years. Increased numbers of children are entering third level education because of the motivation given to them by their parents and the current economic boom and the increase in the age limit is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Community rating provides an incentive for individuals to take out health insurance at a young age. That is also a welcome development. The power to apply late entry premium loadings to persons of over 35 years of age should encourage people to start early. I suggest that people in this age category should get in on the act now.</P>
    <P>Section 10 inserts an exemption from risk equalisation in the case of new insurers entering the market. The period of such exemption will be three years from the date the insurer concerned commences the carrying on of health insurance business. We need competition because it is good for the marketplace. At present, almost 1.7 million members, or 47% of the population, have private health insurance. Everyone would like to see that increase to a figure as close as possible to 90%. To achieve that we must encourage competition in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely difficult for a new competitor to enter the market, because of the costs of setting up and maintaining operations, if the scheme was not tempered in some way to cater for them. If the new insurance companies entering the market do not have a customer base, they will find it very difficult to spread their administration costs over all their customers. Their costs will be very high. Rather than specify a period of three years, the Minister should consider indicating that once a company reaches a <Col N="896" /> certain number of customers, say, 400,000, it will be included in the risk equalisation package. Even at that stage companies should still consider taking into account the extra administrative costs involved over those of a major player in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Bill is before the House. I agree with the previous speaker that there is a need for competition in the marketplace as it leads to cheaper prices. We all know what happened when we had monopolies.</P>
      <P>I heard a representative of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service complain yesterday on radio that there was a shortage of blood. As a consequence, operations in a number of hospitals in this city and in Castlebar have had to be postponed. Will the Department consider requesting the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to come to Leinster House for a day either next Wednesday or the following Wednesday to give the substantial number of people who move around the complex daily an opportunity to donate blood? We do not always have the opportunity to do so as we are busy in our clinics, doing constituency work and moving around the building. I have no doubt Members would show the right example in dealing with the current crisis.</P>
      <P>The Bill, which deals with private health insurance, is timely. The health service is a sick joke. There is no doubt it is in disarray. If one does not have the pounds, shillings and pence, one is in trouble. Money talks in seeking to have a hip replacement, heart or cataract operation performed. As someone who comes from a working class background, this is wrong. We should not have a two tier health system, rather we should have a system which is open to everybody. Perhaps the time has come for some radical thinking and action in the Department. Rather than have public and private consultants and doctors working side by side in the one hospital, given the performance of the economy, perhaps the time has come to consider the establishment of private hospitals, of which there are a number in the State. Perhaps the time has come to refuse to allow consultants employed and paid by a health board to engage in private practice. The public and private mixture has not worked. Public waiting lists are getting longer. We have reached the stage where patients have to wait before being placed on the waiting list. This is wrong. If one has the pounds, shillings and pence one can have whatever operation one needs performed in whatever hospital and at whatever time one likes. This is wrong.</P>

    <P>I know of a gentleman in my county who in recent weeks arrived at Galway Regional Hospital at 9 a.m. As there was no family member at home, the hospital rang a neighbour's wife at 9.30 p.m. to say he would not be kept in overnight. He had to be rushed from home at 7 a.m. the following morning to Mayo General Hospital from where he was transferred to Swinford. He was still there last week. I tabled a parliamentary <Col N="897" /> question in this regard and this morning received a reply from the health board in my office in Westport. The last two lines &ndash; I will not read the entire letter as I do not want to identify the official in the health board from whom I received it &ndash; read as follows:</P>
    <P>According to the nursing staff on duty, Mr. X was indeed very distressed and upset that he was not remaining in hospital. If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.</P>
    <P>The gentleman concerned who had a very serious infection was sent home to an empty house in which there was no fire lit. He had to ring his neighbour at 7 a.m. the following morning to be rushed to Mayo General Hospital. This proves the point that we have a two tier health system. If on the evening concerned he had said he was prepared to pay for a private bed and a private consultant, he would not have been sent home, rather he would have been given the best bed in the hospital and received the best of attention. There is something wrong in the health service.</P>
    <P>I know of another gentleman who was waiting two weeks to be transferred to St. James's Hospital to which he was transported by his two daughters to insist that he be given a bed. He is no longer with us, he is dead. There is something wrong in the health service.</P>
    <P>I know of a 57 year old woman awaiting admission to the National Rehabilitation Hospital. I was informed by the manager of the hospital by letter last week &ndash; I have since tabled a parliamentary question &ndash; that there are three patients in the hospital from the Western Health Board area as there are no day care services available in the province. What has gone wrong in the health service?</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i>, <i>Sunday Independent</i>, <i>The Irish Times </i>and <i>Irish Examiner </i>daily carry advertisements for programme managers, assistant programme managers, press officers and assistant press officers, despite the fact that there is a shortage of nurses and beds and waiting lists are getting longer. The best the people concerned can do is give up to 50 patients hospital appointments at 11 a.m., some of whom will have to wait until 10 p.m. before being seen. Those employed by the health boards are trying to create chaos to justify their jobs, upsetting the general public in the process. They are saying to the Minister and the health boards that they are running the service. If these people were working for an international company, they would lose their jobs very quickly. There is something seriously wrong with the manner in which hospital services are being run. I would like to see a service in which everyone would be treated equally and where those in need of attention would receive it promptly. That is not happening; people are becoming increasingly angry and upset and are beginning to wonder why they are paying taxes.</P>
    <P>I intend to table a parliamentary question next week to find out how many programme managers <Col N="898" /> and assistant programme managers have been employed in the hospital services over the past ten years and what increases there have been on a year by year basis. I also intend to table questions to find out how many nurses were employed over that period and what increases there have been in the numbers of doctors, consultants etc. It appears the hospital services are becoming increasingly top-heavy in regard to the ratio of officials to medical staff. The health service is not operating as it should and the Minister for Health and Children has responsibility to rectify this imbalance.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has written to the chief executive officers of the health boards seeking new guidelines for medical cards. The decreasing level of medical card provision constitutes a further attack on the weak and poor in our society. I tabled a parliamentary question recently seeking information on the number of medical cards held throughout Ireland. Up to June 2000, 87,256 cards had been issued. In June 1996, some 91,500 people held medical cards. An increasing number of people are losing medical cards because the chief executive officers of the health boards, who have responsibility for this issue, do not seem to have any understanding of people's needs. Last year, a single person who lived alone was entitled to a medical card if he or she had an income of £92 per week but he or she was not eligible with an income of £93. The cut-off limit was increased later in the year by £1.50 to £93.50 and by £2 per week for a family unit. The Minister should come into the real world. A person in receipt of the minimum hourly wage rate who works for a few hours per week would not qualify for a medical card. I call on the Minister and the health boards to introduce realistic medical card guidelines this year. The limit should be substantially increased because the current limits are insulting to people. People are essentially being told that they will not receive hospital services unless they can pay for them. They are even being denied access to their GPs on whom an increasing number of them rely in the absence of hospital services. Hospital waiting lists are increasing and we now have waiting lists for waiting lists. I hope the next budget will result in substantial increases in medical card guidelines.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has launched an attack on tobacco companies. As a non-smoker, I feel this is a cowardly attack because the Department is afraid to attack drink companies on the same basis. We witness the abuse of alcohol daily on the streets of our towns and villages. We see people under the influence of drink becoming involved in increasingly vicious assaults. The Government has reneged on its responsibility to address this problem. It is not prepared to take on either the drink companies or big business. I agree that the tobacco industry should be dealt with but it should not be isolated. That is cowardly and hypocritical. If we are not prepared to allow tobacco companies to sponsor <Col N="899" /> Formula 1, we should not allow Guinness to advertise in Croke Park or Lansdowne Road. We must be consistent.</P>
    <P>Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are scourges which affect every family in Ireland. Moderate alcohol consumption can be a very sociable activity. However, when alcohol is abused, families suffer. I often think that instead of imposing huge fines on men for disorderly behaviour or drink driving, judges would do better to send them to jail. These people will go out drinking again the following week. Their wives will have to find the money to pay the fines and their children will suffer.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise an issue which is close to my heart and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. A debate has raged in recent weeks in County Mayo and Connacht in general in regard to the provision of breast cancer services. The health board is due to make a decision on this matter in the coming weeks. Why must all specialist services be located in cities such as Dublin or Galway? Why will the Department not consider locating these services in the regions? There is a proposal to move the existing cancer services in Castlebar to Galway with the result that people in need of treatment must travel to Galway, Letterkenny or Dublin.</P>
    <P>Why will the Department not consider making Mayo General Hospital a specialist centre? Different centres could offer different specialties but services should not all be concentrated in the same areas. People in Galway could travel to Castlebar for treatment. After all, it is the same distance from Galway to Castlebar as it is from Castlebar to Galway. Why should the people of Mayo be treated as second class citizens? Why does the Department not consider locating specialist services in Roscommon or Sligo?</P>
    <P>Consultants, not hospital consultants, are only good for making money. All Government Departments are filled with consultants' reports. As long as the Government keeps paying them, consultants will tell it what it wants to hear. I do not know where these people get their titles but they can pull the wool over the eyes of departmental and health board officials. I do not understand why consultants always recommend the location of services in bigger population centres. The services should be spread out. The people of Castlebar and County Mayo do not want the breast cancer services to be withdrawn from Mayo General Hospital. We would like to see the specialist service being transferred to Castlebar rather than locating it in a larger population centre.</P>
    <P>Regarding the elderly, ourselves and Italy were always respected for looking after family members &ndash; mothers, fathers and grandparents &ndash; but we seem to have lost that touch. We have become more like America, we are too busy and are working harder and longer hours. The Minister has responsibility for the elderly. I am concerned at the abuse of the elderly which has been <Col N="900" /> evident from recent court cases and reports. The Minister has established a committee and I hope he will introduce the necessary recommendations and that a helpline will be put in place so that those being abused at home, in State care or in nursing homes can report it. The elderly are vulnerable and when they are in a supervised place they can be afraid. They must be protected and it will be a sad state of affairs if that is not done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this Bill. It affords providers of health insurance an opportunity to respond to the growing and urgent demands for additional products and services. This is a most significant Bill.</P>
      <P>Despite the most stringent and close questioning at a recent meeting of the Committee on Health and Children, which was attended by representatives of BUPA and VHI, the concepts of community rating and risk equalisation have continued to evade clarification. I trust that by the time the Bill is taken through Committee Stage, my knowledge will be broadened. In this respect I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to talk to the Minister given that risk equalisation was taken out in 1998 by the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the huge increase in the number of people being insured. Prior to competition market cover was 33% but it now covers 46% of the population.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for his reaction to various comments made by BUPA on risk equalisation. It claims it is happy the proposed health insurance authority would have the freedom to recommend a risk equalisation scheme if such a scheme was independently considered necessary by the authority to maintain market stability and if in the view of the authority it would be desirable taking account of the impact of any such scheme on damage to competition in the market and implications for inflation in the health sector. It claims any threat to market stability should be assessed on objective criteria in terms of down-sizing the market, the exit of older age policy holders and-or the pending financial collapse of one or more insurers. While it feels no insurer could compete in a market if the authority did not consider these issues, but focused solely on an unknown academic mathematical review of risk profiles, perhaps the review as proposed in the Bill could be undertaken as an input to the authority's evaluation and only in relation to the relevant market segments. I trust these points may be addressed in the Minister's closing speech on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Private health insurance has had a big impact in Ireland. VHI covers 40% of the population, with 1.5 million members, while BUPA in a very short time has reached 180,000 customers. This increasing sector is providing an important service for many people every year. Competition in the sector is healthy, as it is in most sectors, and I trust this legislation will not only widen the level of service being given <i>via </i>the incorporation of primary medical care, but will maintain the scope <Col N="901" /> for true competition to flourish and not impede any aspect of the community rating system which is vital for fair play throughout the sector.</P>
    <P>In respect of the primary health care market, the Minister in his speech on Second Stage confirmed that the new proposal does not affect the existing eligibility arrangements for health services under which persons are given access to primary care services on the basis of need. It is aimed at giving people who fund their primary care needs on a pay as you go basis the choice of financing their care by means of insurance. This was initiated in the Government White Paper, which stated the evolution of private insurance was to include steps to promote the position of the primary care sector within the system.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's comment that health insurance is geared to expensive hospital based treatments to the disregard of more minor but very pertinent areas of dental or other primary health care, which tends to leave the consumer open to sizeable expense. It is welcome that within the new remit there will be scope for the development of preventative and early detection services. These have not had a significance in insurance to date. The focus has been on times when things have reached a serious stage and people are in hospital.</P>
    <P>Everybody should be in a position to access health care. It is regrettable that any person, even one with private health insurance, should feel he or she could not afford visits to a doctor. There are many such people who leave their health care on the long finger until such time as they can no longer ignore the aches and pains. At that point their health insurance may kick in, but their medical difficulty could be quite serious. In this respect, the development of the primary care sector is extremely important and may be a measure which will save lives alongside its delivery of a range of greater services and providers through which they can access the services.</P>
    <P>There is also a change in the provision of services to people aged 65 and over who have not previously taken out community rated insurance in that insurers will be obliged to cover this age group, a most welcome addition. The elderly in our communities have helped through their lifetimes to build the country and have contributed over many years to the State. It is therefore essential that when they age and become more vulnerable all levels of health care are available to them. This should include the option of private insurance. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will be geared particularly towards the concerns of the elderly given that he has responsibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>Given that many people speaking on the Bill may not address the details but will bemoan the fact that our public health system should cater for all and that there should be no need for private health insurance, I wish to say there are aspects of the health system which have developed under the current Administration which must be acknowledged. I congratulate the Minister and <Col N="902" /> the Ministers of State on the very important progress which has been made, particularly in relation to breast cancer. Through the co-operation of Europe Madona and the Reach to Recovery group I have gained a small level of knowledge in this field and know that early detection can lead to great success. People are not getting the positive message of early detection. I commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, on the Breast Check initiative and request that everyone involved continues with the development of the project to ensure people in the north-west can avail of this most valuable service. This has real life saving potential and nobody should ever be forced into private health care to deal with such things as breast cancer.</P>
    <P>I commend the existing cross-Border services which the North Western Health Board operates with hospitals throughout Ulster. This co-operation makes geographical sense at a time when the road network from Donegal to Dublin continues to grind to a halt. What was a car journey of three and a half hours now takes five hours, and in this context I ask the Minister to continue the great work which has begun in terms of cross-Border services. Most of us can understand the frustration of being in a car for five hours, but not all of us have had the experience of being ill and in a vehicle, be it a car or an ambulance, for this time. It is heartening to know there are specialist hospitals within two hours of us for most if not all ailments. This journey makes an appointment at 9.00 a.m. much more manageable. I cannot over-emphasise this point. The work of the Minister with his colleagues on the Northern Executive, particularly Bairbre de Brún, must continue and advance for the sake of the people of Donegal.</P>
    <P>In this context I also wish to refer to the breast care programme. I visited London and met experts from St. Bartholomew's, Guys and other hospitals and the message was clear &ndash; the women of Ireland need a number of well resourced locations where multi-disciplinary work can be carried out. Only with this serious approach to breast cancer will we reduce the high incidence being presented in the country. Therefore, that puts immediate stress on the ability to successfully treat the cancer. I congratulate the Donegal hospice on the recent turning of the sod for the new facility in Donegal. It works alongside the Foyle hospice in Derry with which my family had direct contact. It is outstanding for both patient and family. I cannot speak highly enough of their role in looking after cancer sufferers in the county.</P>
    <P>Therefore, given the journeys involved for people in such large rural counties for major centres, in this case because of the proximity of very good facilities at a near destination we must maximise the resources within a minimum distance. Having spoken to medical experts it is clear that the decision in relation to the location of breast care services should not be politicised or be a geopolitical decision. Making a geopolitical <Col N="903" /> point, when I first came into this House the national cancer strategy had been drawn up by the previous Administration and there was a great hullabaloo about the fact that the whole country would be covered. When I asked about the centres I was informed they were in Dublin, Galway, Cork and Athlone. There may have been another which I cannot recall. When I asked about coverage for my area I was informed that I was close to Galway. To put matters in perspective, my home town is 20 miles further from Galway than from Dublin. I am pleased things have changed and that people are beginning to realise there are hospitals throughout Ulster that could provide work. It has to be done on a cross-Border basis. When it comes to breast cancer the best facility must be put in place and within a minimum distance if possible. The patient must come first.</P>
    <P>I trust that any alteration we make to our health insurance cover will take into consideration the new arrangements that exist at a political level throughout the island of Ireland and that people who, for whatever treatment, might wish to attend a facility in Derry or Belfast will not be hindered by the rules of the health care cover. Ultimately if there is something that can be done to assist people to remain healthy that would be the best course of action. In this respect I congratulate the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the number of grants he allocated in July for sporting facilities. This is an important resource for young and old. I trust the Minister, Deputy McDaid, will continue to acquire adequate funds from the Department of Finance to complete the many projects that remain outstanding. It would be good if the health insurance companies expanded the services they are beginning to offer. The vhihealthe.com and the &ldquo;Go for it&rdquo; and &ldquo;Get Unstressed&rdquo; healthy lifestyle initiatives are important. The latter provides a 24 hour nurse-medical information line.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on its support for voluntary housing and associated support units. In Donegal there are many examples of these which help to keep people out of hospital. Similarly the supports provided to the mental health and carers categories under this Administration have greatly assisted those in most need. I encourage the development of more support units, more help for carers, more respite and more support for home helps. I thank the Minister for sanctioning the Alzheimer's facility in Carndonagh. It is important that patients with these types of illnesses are covered by their health care insurance. Section 8 of the Bill will probably assist this age group.</P>
    <P>Not everyone can afford private health care insurance and it would be wrong to assume they can. In the context of the forthcoming budget I ask the Minister to look at medical card eligibility and either increase the income limit substantially, to take the net rather than the gross income level, and-or develop a tiered system whereby a certain <Col N="904" /> basic income would allow one to have a full medical card. If one had a certain amount above the limit one should be allowed a certain number of doctor visits and prescriptions free of charge. As one's income increases the number of doctor visits and prescriptions free of charge would decrease. I acknowledge the significant increases in the limit for the elderly. This has happened over the last couple of budgets and it is an important achievement.</P>
    <P>We have had a serious difficulty with the number of younger and older people smoking. Deputy Ring referred to this and made a half-hearted attempt to slap the Government over the wrists for trying to deal with the position. This matter is being addressed by the Minister and the Joint Committee on Health and Children. I am of the view that the nicotine replacement packs and-or the new treatment aimed at supporting people to quit smoking should be brought under the medical card system. Where does this topic stand in respect of the private health insurance and the concept of preventative action? I agree with Deputy Ring that drink related illnesses should be brought under the system also. Ultimately prevention would lower health costs in the longer term.</P>
    <P>A friend of mind who should have been admitted for a serious operation tomorrow is being sent home because the blood bank does not have a supply of blood. I agree with Deputy Ring's suggestion that we should have a facility here for people to give blood. There should always be a contingency plan for emergencies on which the blood bank can call for blood. This is a serious situation. When representatives of the blood bank came before the committee they asked us to encourage blood donors. I am asking people to give blood because others cannot get the services they need over the next few days. That should not happen. I encourage the blood bank to look at its long-term strategy in times of flooding or other catastrophes when people cannot get blood transfusions.</P>
    <P>I could go on about the waiting list for public versus private patients. Initiatives are being introduced in my area. Whether these are in the orthodontic service or hip replacements the cross-Border element could assist in reducing those waiting lists. While the shortage of nurses needs to be sorted out I believe the Minister is working towards that end.</P>
    <P>Speech therapists, orthodontists, physiotherapists and all those specialities that do not seem to be coming to Donegal do not know what they are missing. I encourage those with a speciality in the field to give it a chance because we have much to offer. I ask the Dublin hospitals to think about those travelling long distances, from Donegal or west Cork, and to give reasonable appointments. If they cannot deal with the person on the day I ask them not to call them to Dublin and send them home again.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my own health board, the hospitals and the medical staff who do a tremen<Col N="905" /> dous amount of work. We always hear the negative aspects and seldom the positive aspects of what they do. It should be acknowledged that they work hard. In respect of people who work hard in the Department of Health and Children I wish to acknowledge one person within the system. I pay tribute to the significant work done by Gobnait O'Connell not only as a health care professional but in her role as an adviser to the Minister. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a aimn dílis.</P>
    <P>While not every issue will be solved by this Bill, it is a positive step. If competition can be kept in the market place and if the insurance market place is driven there will be advantages for those availing of it. Almost half the people have private health insurance. I look forward to dealing with this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P Just="Center">noting the report of the Chief Justice into the circumstances leading to the early release of Mr. Philip Sheedy and the Chief Justice's acknowledgement that it was not possible for him, on the basis of written statements and individual interviews, to resolve disputed questions of fact and that to do so would necessitate an inquiry of a nature different from that instituted by him;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What has become known as the Sheedy case has ricocheted through the judicial and political systems like a plague, leaving devastation everywhere in its wake. Everyone and everything touched by the Sheedy case has suffered, including the Sheedy family themselves. Nobody, however, has suffered from the tragedy comparably to the pain and loss inflicted on the Ryan family, who are constituents of mine. Unfortunately, nothing we can do in this House can restore the late Ann Ryan to her family. I am sure everyone involved, including Philip Sheedy and all Members of this House, would wish that it were otherwise.</P>
      <P>What this House can do, however, is put in place a mechanism to facilitate answers to the profoundly serious questions that remain unanswered and that have already been adduced in this debate. The Sheedy affair will never be banished from the national psyche until an honest, open attempt is made to have those questions answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was appalling, last night, to watch the bizarre conduct and inappropriate buffoonery of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his reply to the Fine Gael motion. I am not predisposed towards believing that the inquiry <Col N="907" /> demanded in this motion will reveal premeditated, malign motivation on the part of any of the actors involved. In fact, I believe it will demonstrate nothing of the kind, but that is not an argument for the Opposition parties to collude with the manifest desire of the Government parties to sweep the Sheedy affair under the carpet.</P>
    <P>Public confidence in the administration of justice and in judicial credibility is the most significant casualty of the Sheedy affair. Is the coalition Government asking the House simply to ignore this issue and to move on? The detailed questions that arise from this proposition were spelled out by Deputies Shatter and Jim Higgins last night and I do not have time to repeat them here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin has forensically demonstrated that from day one the attitude of Fianna Fáil has been to shut down the questioning. On June 27 this year, when Deputy Howlin sponsored a motion that would have caused an invitation to issue to former judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, to voluntarily appear before the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to answer some of the relevant questions, Fianna Fáil contrived to use its majority on the committee to vote down the Labour Party motion. This stifling of the committee took place against the background of the then Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's offer &ldquo;to make a statement to the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Affairs, and to answer any and all questions its members may raise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why would Fianna Fáil want to obstruct the committee from providing such a straightforward open forum to answer some of the questions that were, and still are, uppermost in the minds of the public? The Fianna Fáil desire to kill off this issue is a pattern that runs through the entire affair. At the outset, they tried to shake off the tenacious reporting of <i>The Star</i> newspaper. They tried to use the Hamilton report to terminate further scrutiny of the issue. When I wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, at the request of Mr. John Ryan, on 15 February 1999 &ndash; long before the matter came into the public domain &ndash; I said,<i> inter alia</i>, &ldquo;I would be greatly obliged if you would direct whomsoever is appropriate in your Department, to let me know on behalf of the Ryan family what is the official position in respect of this matter&rdquo;. I received only the customary acknowledgement. I was forced to write again, on 12 March, to complain that: &ldquo;I was greatly disappointed that, having regard to the serious questions raised, I have had no reply other than an acknowledgement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Eventually, after the matter came into the public domain, the Minister replied to me on 22 April, attributing his failure to reply to the assertion that, &ldquo;In truth, a number of draft replies had been prepared but each time the contents were overtaken by events&rdquo;. I have no idea to what this refers, but I wonder if I would ever have received a reply if the public controversy had not erupted. Quite frankly, on such a grave matter, <Col N="908" /> that is neither acceptable from the Minister nor from his Department. It is, however, in keeping with my own personal experience in dealing with that Minister and that Department.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister and, through him, his officials to make available to me an explanation as to what is meant by this sentence, &ldquo;In truth, a number of draft replies had been prepared but each time the contents were overtaken by events&rdquo;. I am entitled to apply for it under the Freedom of Information Act, but I would ask the Minister to furnish it to me without my having to do that. I am ashamed to say that I do not believe any drafts were prepared. I do not believe either the Department or the Minister had any intention of replying to me. I would remind the House that I had sought the Minister's assistance on 15 February 1999, at the request of Mr John Ryan. I was replied to &ndash; on such a serious matter &ndash; on 22 April, but only after it had become public.</P>
    <P>The same Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, came into the House last night to respond to the Fine Gael motion seeking an inquiry, against the background of his own statement to the Dáil, on 20 April 1999, that, &ldquo;It must be clear to everyone that a tribunal of inquiry is necessary if the disputed facts are to be resolved&rdquo;. Why has the Minister changed his mind? His reasoning seems bizarre and distasteful. First, he argues that such an inquiry would only cause further trauma to the families involved, the implication being that to do so would be, somehow, the fault of the sponsors of this motion.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;What likelihood is there&rdquo;, the Minister asked, &ldquo;that matters which remained undisclosed throughout the entire period since the Sheedy case first came to public attention would now suddenly be made known&rdquo;? This statement must surely be indicative of a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the oddest mindset ever to have held that office. He then devotes five pages of his script to an entirely inappropriate and distasteful attack on the credentials of the author, Mr. Richard Douthwaite, whose candidacy for the EIB apparently attracted the endorsement of Fine Gael. This descent into vulgar ignorant abuse of an intellectual &ndash; whose ideas are not mainstream, but who has pricked the curiosity and conscience of many thinking people &ndash; was bizarre and inappropriate. I wonder if his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, approves of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue's, lamentably ignorant efforts to poke fun at Richard Douthwaite? It ill behoves the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to attempt to ridicule a man who has repeatedly put his ideas between book covers to some critical acclaim, when the Minister's total literary output is his tragicomedy on zero tolerance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also note from the record, that the Minister was cheered on from the sidelines by that other <Col N="909" /> well known expert on sustainable growth and global warming, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. In any event, a motion on the Sheedy affair and its tragic consequences and unanswered questions, was not the appropriate place for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's reversion to his vaudeville personality.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is pleased to support the thrust of Deputy Shatter's motion. On an aspect of detail, though, our view would be that in order to inquire into the Sheedy affair, the Tribunals of Inquiries Acts are adequate.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil votes on this issue in about an hour's time, Opposition Deputies will duly troop into the lobby to vote against the Government amendment. They will do so in a comfortable frame of mind, secure in the knowledge that the Dáil will endorse the sensible response of the Government and of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the blatantly opportunistic motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>In an effort to lend an appearance of gravitas to the proceedings, the Fine Gael Whips had each member of their parliamentary party append his or her name to the notice of motion. Reading that notice, one might well imagine that this is regarded as a live and burning issue by all Fine Gael Deputies who dutifully added their names to the list. The truth is that no such fervour was evident during the debate in Private Members' time yesterday. For most of this supposedly important debate just three Opposition Deputies have been in the House. Deputy Rabbitte is the fourth. That makes three Deputies from Fine Gael and one Labour Party spokesman. Perhaps a few more will troop in as a result of what I have said.</P>
      <P>One does not normally expect a full house on occasions like this, but if Fine Gael was seriously exercised about the issues involved, surely it might have mustered a few more Deputies &ndash; half a dozen, perhaps &ndash; to proclaim their support for Deputy Shatter's arguments and to vent the indignation they profess to feel. Where are they and why are they not in the House? The answer is that, in the first place, they have more sense than to go out of their way to dignify an obviously insincere and cynical exercise in parliamentary tactics.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, was disposed to be charitable when trying to assess the motives of the Opposition in putting forward this motion. It is hard to believe that a responsible political party would, in such a crass and brutal fashion, seek to capitalise on the awful tragedy that befell so many people, especially the Ryan family. Why would it go to such lengths to reopen questions that have already been the subject of no less than four separate reports including a report by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights? Why does it want to discuss again an issue that has received more media coverage than any other subject since I was elected to this House? On one weekend alone, 43 articles by 17 different journalists referred to the O'Flaherty affair. I felt that was at the time &ldquo;a bit over the top&rdquo;. I said so to Charlie Bird and Eamon Dunphy. In the following weekend's Sunday newspapers I found out just how sensitive some of them were. One even referred to me as Mugabe. The answer is clearly political opportunism in the hope that it can once again create a similar media frenzy. Perhaps it might be a godsend to the Labour Party to detract from its £3 billion spending policy statement.</P>

      <P>The matter has been investigated diligently and exhaustively and an investigation carried out by the most senior judge in the State must stand for something. The fact is that we have had all the reports we could possibly have on this issue. Those reports have established certain facts and I do not see how a further inquiry would throw any additional light on the actions of the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real answer lurks in concealment behind the unctuous legalistic arguments advanced by Deputies Shatter and Howlin yesterday. The truth is that Fine Gael and Labour believe their parties benefited politically from the extensive publicity generated by this issue throughout the <Col N="911" /> year. They want to keep it going and they do not care who gets hurt in the process. That, and not any genuine concern for the legal system, is what this is all about. The Opposition leadership is under the impression that it will again gain political rewards by treating the public to yet another spin of this long playing record. However, the record is beginning to sound scratchy and overplayed.</P>
    <P>The truly sickening extent of Fine Gael's vindictiveness and rank hypocrisy in its approach to Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty was exposed last night by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. Such was the Fine Gael leadership's spite in Mr. O'Flaherty's case that it supported the nomination by the Green Party for the board of the European Investment Bank of a gentleman whose views on economic matters and on Europe generally are totally alien to those of Fine Gael Deputies, as they would be to those of most Deputies in the House. That gentleman's views would, if they were aired at a Fine Gael party meeting, be the subject of raucous ridicule. Yet, such is the party leadership's thirst for vengeance on Hugh O'Flaherty that it was prepared to send this man to represent us on the European Investment Bank. That is just about the ultimate in sheer irresponsibility. How many Fine Gael Deputies who signed tonight's motion were aware of this man's views? Were they consulted about his nomination? That decision by Fine Gael was certainly not indicative of a party that entertains any serious aspirations of being in Government.</P>
    <P>The political agenda that prompts this debate is transparent and the people will see through it. The people can distinguish the enormous difference between a crime and a mistake. At the heart of this issue lies a mistake &ndash; the mistaken gesture of a compassionate and decent man. As a consequence, he resigned his prestigious position and returned to private life. The Deputies opposite should drop the hypocrisy and pretence that they want an inquiry under a foreign judge to enlighten them further about this unhappy episode. They want to create an expensive forum which will command more airtime and more newsprint as old coals are raked over repeatedly. What is a good deal worse is that they want a vindictive witch hunt so that they can continue to punish and pillory individuals who have already paid dearly for any errors of judgment they may have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising the question of whether there should be an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding what has become known as the Sheedy affair. I accept there is continuing public interest in the matter and it is reasonable the Dáil should consider if a further inquiry is warranted. It is important to set out where stands the issue of inquiring into the matter and what has been done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated yesterday, three separate inquiries have been <Col N="912" /> conducted which have resulted in three reports. The main report was that of the most senior member of the Judiciary, the former Chief Justice. There was also a report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a report of the Chief State Solicitor's office. These reports were considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, under the chairmanship, at that time, of Deputy Eoin Ryan and, in his absence, Deputy Barnes.</P>
    <P>One of the issues adverted to by the joint committee was the effect that all the publicity and ongoing discussion has on the family of the late Anne Ryan. I am sure there is a wish in this House not to prolong the grief of the family who lost a wife, mother and daughter.</P>
    <P>A report of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution in respect of the courts and the Judiciary has been prepared. A report is awaited from the judicial committee which is examining the question of judicial conduct. The amendment tabled by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, last night requests the Government to examine the constitutional, legislative and other initiatives which may be required in relation to matters dealt with in those reports.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to what an inquiry would achieve beyond the facts already brought out in the initial inquiries. The Minister stated last night that he believes it would be extremely unlikely to uncover facts or motives so far undisclosed in the course of all the other inquiries that have taken place. One of these reports was conducted by the State's most senior judge, as was mentioned. I agree with the Minister it would not be right to set up what would undoubtedly be a very expensive process with no realistic prospect of producing worthwhile results.</P>
    <P>The idea of bringing a judge in from another jurisdiction to carry out an inquiry does not sit comfortably with me. I would have thought that such a suggestion could be deemed as a slight on the Irish Judiciary, particularly given that Deputy Higgins said last night that the Judiciary has the capacity to be incisively and piercingly self-critical.</P>
    <P>The foreign judge aspect of the motion might have been included because of the shortage of available judges in Ireland due to the number of tribunals of inquiry and judicial inquiries in progress at present. The Government has never shirked its responsibility for setting up a judicial inquiry when it was necessary in the public interest and likely to achieve results. The number of such inquiries in progress at present is testament to the Government's good faith in those matters. We are fast approaching a situation where there will be judicial and parliamentary gridlock, a situation where we are so involved in looking back that we do so at the expense of ensuring our future actions are done in a right and proper manner.</P>
    <P>When one balances pragmatically the inquiries that have taken place, the work being done by the judicial committee on judicial conduct, the <Col N="913" /> ongoing examination by the Government of the constitutional, legislative and other matters raised, the scarce time and resources which would be taken up by an inquiry and the extreme unlikelihood of uncovering further important facts on the affairs, one finds that an inquiry, as suggested by Deputy Shatter, would not serve this State. I support the amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment tabled by the Minister. There has been a number of reports on this matter, which are listed in the amendment to the motion &ndash; the report of the Chief Justice, the report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the report of the Chief State Solicitor's office and the reports of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. Those are very extensive documents.</P>
      <P>The Opposition tabled this motion. Deputy Shatter, in moving the motion yesterday, referred to certain unanswered questions. That has been a persistent feature of press, Opposition and general comment on this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter did not point to the existence of a single document which would justify us in carrying this inquiry further from the inquiries that have already been undertaken on the matter. He did not point to the existence of a single statement inconsistent with anything that has been said by the various witnesses who have given their account of the matters in question to the various investigations which have taken place.</P>
      <P>I must, therefore, question whether we can justify the expense of a further inquiry which, in all probability and on the basis of what Deputy Shatter laid before the House yesterday, would not carry the matter further. I am not convinced, on the basis of what was outlined to the House yesterday, that the inquiry proposed in the motion would establish further facts in this matter. It is most unlikely it would, on the basis of my reading of the reports on this matter that have been laid before the House. We are dealing with a realm of speculation rather than fact and an attempt to establish an inquiry to investigate speculations rather than facts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins brought my name into this debate yesterday and asked me to state my level of involvement on the public record. I have done so in the past and I do not think it just of him to raise the matter in this context, when I have already dealt with it in a public context and on the public record. I do not want to impugn Deputy Shatter in this regard &ndash; he made a fair case and I am trying to reply to it. However, it was deplorable of Deputy Higgins to engage in that kind of broad-brush approach by bringing names into the debate solely for the purpose of suggesting a level of involvement which has been publicly dealt with, as far as I am concerned, and which simply does not exist. That is an example of the kind of false foundation that is being advanced for this inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> However, there is a constructive matter to which we should all attend. I was glad all the parties involved in the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution's fourth progress report were able to agree a number of very practical matters in relation to the establishment of a proper foundation for judicial ethics in the Constitution and a proper system for its enforcement.</P>
    <P>The courts are established by the people under the Constitution and no suggestion should be tolerated that the courts can, in some sense, formulate, enforce and police their own code of ethics, apart from the general one that is given by the people to the courts in the Constitution. There should be an express recognition in our Constitution of the need to formulate such a code of ethics, the need for a judicial council, whose function it should be to investigate this, and the need for lay participation in any such judicial council. If we were to establish such a council, it would go a long way to allay public fears in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the case of the former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and former Judge Kelly &ndash; I do not seek to differentiate them in this regard &ndash; the Government and the Chief Justice, who conducted an inquiry into the matter, were in the very difficult position of having no intermediate sanction or censure available to them in relation to the matter. They were left in the position where either the option of impeachment had to be pursued or no censure whatsoever would be attached to the personages in question. No intermediate sanction exists in relation to a judge of the High Court or Supreme Court under the Constitution. That unsatisfactory state of affairs is addressed in the progress report.</P>
    <P>That report also addresses the whole question of the impeachment procedure itself. It is clear from the view the Ceann Comhairle took at that time that there are frailties in our existing impeachment procedures, which date back to the so-called glorious revolution &ndash; which, of course, was not very glorious as far as this country was concerned &ndash; in the late 18th century and are clearly in need of reform. I commend that report as a constructive way forward for the political establishment in this matter. I agree with all the speakers that we must do all in our power to foster respect on our part for the institutions to which we belong and confidence on the part of the public in them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred last night to the qualifications of the nominee put forward by Fine Gael for the European Investment Bank. The nominee has interesting views on economics and the environment. However, what I find most amusing or strange about the nominee suggested by Fine Gael is that he was on record as being opposed to the establishment of a European currency. That seems a rather extraordinary conviction to be entertained by someone deemed worthy by the principal Opposition party to be a suitable nominee for the position of the Director of the European Investment Bank. It is extraordinary that, at <Col N="915" /> the time, the matter did not receive more investigation.</P>
    <P>That chapter is closed. No words of ours can take from the tragedy suffered by the Ryan family in this matter. Lesser tragedies and hurts were suffered by those who should have been, and were, called to account for their involvement in what subsequently ensued. We would do best, as a House, by proceeding to see how we can put the Judiciary on that kind of firm, ethical foundation. We would serve better the cause of respect for ourselves and the Judiciary among the general community were we to take that course. That is why I am happy to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. There was a time in the recent history of this House when Private Members' time was a forum for advancing and debating legislation from the Opposition benches. The present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform pioneered the art of legislative reform in Opposition and demonstrated that an active and enthusiastic parliamentarian could, from the Opposition benches, lead the process of legislative reform. Those days seem to be gone. Tonight the Opposition calls for the enactment of legislation which it cannot, or will not, prepare. It calls on the Government to enact legislation. No explanation is offered as to why Deputy Shatter is either disinclined or unable to draft the necessary legislation. He should share his difficulty with the House. Was it that the Deputy tried to draft the legislation he seeks to have the Government enact and failed? If so, he should declare his failed efforts to the House. Or was it that he simply could not be bothered? Is that the extent of his commitment? That, too, should be shared with the House.</P>
      <P>Whatever the answer, it is clear that the crafting of the legislation which it sought is either beyond Deputy Shatter's ability, which I doubt, or beyond his inclination. In the circumstances, he has resorted to the ultimate call of the part-time parliamentarian. He wants somebody else to do his work for him. Such a glib and tabloid approach to legislation is not the hallmark of the serious spokesperson which I thought Deputy Shatter to be. It is the refuge of the lazy. Deputy Shatter's call for &ldquo;somebody to do something because I cannot or will not&rdquo; is a calculated insult to the work that has already been undertaken on this issue by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. Twice in the past 18 months, on 20 May 1999 and 24 June 1999, the committee reported to this House. The reports were not rejected by the House but were noted for what they were &ndash; fair and honourable efforts to resolve a difficult matter. The reports, unlike Deputy Shatter's motion, were well-considered documents into which a great deal of work had been put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee considered in detail, and at length, the advice of an eminent senior counsel. His experience and advice is reflected in the <Col N="916" /> deliberations of the committee and in its conclusions. Its reports deserve better than the glib one line dismissal they receive in the motion. It is as if the joint committee had not ever sat or considered this issue. Had Deputy Shatter chosen to address in a meaningful manner the legislation which he calls for he would have been forced to accept, as the joint committee accepted, that this is an issue that goes to the heart of the doctrine of the separation of powers. This doctrine is central to our constitutional democracy. It is neither new nor without pedigree. Both the 1937 Constitution and its 1922 predecessor enumerate the powers of Government in three distinct categories, legislative, executive and judicial. In the Sinn Féin funds case Mr. Justice O'Byrne, speaking in the Supreme Court stated: &ldquo;In this State all powers of Government shall be exercised in accordance with the well recognised principle of the distribution of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial organs of the State and require that these powers should not be exercised by others&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The doctrine of the separation of powers was again expressly recognised by Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh in the case re Haughey in 1971 where he stated: &ldquo;The Constitution of Ireland is founded on the doctrine of the tripartite division of the powers of the Government&rdquo;. In Crotty .<i>v</i>. The Taoiseach in 1987 Chief Justice Finlay addressed the issue and stated: &ldquo;The separation of powers involves for each of the three constitutional organs not only rights but duties also, not only areas of activity and function but boundaries to them as well&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This motion is an ill-considered attack on the doctrine of the separation of powers. It seems to ignore and breach boundaries that have served this State well and does so in an ill-considered manner. Does anyone seriously believe this half-page call for unspecified legislation is a suitable reaction to an issue that has already been examined by the highest judge in the land and twice by an all-party Oireachtas committee? If the proposers of the motion were serious in their quest for legislation they could have sought to craft that legislation. They could have addressed in some meaningful manner the doctrine of separation of powers and indicated where they wanted the acknowledged boundaries breached and how the proposed breach would be constitutional.</P>

      <P>The motion is a mass of contradictions and hypocrisies. It quotes Article 35.2 regarding the independence of the Judiciary but then seeks to directly contravene the Constitution by calling for a foreign judge to inquire into what are clearly judicial matters. What in justice would the inquiry suggested by this squalid little motion set right? Judge Matthews sentenced Philip Sheedy to four years imprisonment with a promise of a review after two years plus 12 years suspension of his driving licence. When this was reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, it handed down a two year sentence which he has served.</P>
      <P>We passed the legislation. The courts have enforced it. We cannot proceed to second guess them in every case. If the Oireachtas wants more severe penalties for such drink driving cases, we have it in our power to introduce such measures by legislative amendments. If the proposers of this motion are truly serious in their concerns, they should be using tonight's Private Members' time to debate a Bill to give effect to this change, not rehashing old political skirmishes. This motion inherently rejects the concept of the separation of powers as enshrined in the Constitution. The Constitution as approved by the people contains a balanced separation of powers in the same way as the earlier Free State Constitution. The courts in their rulings on matters relating to the Oireachtas and the Cabinet have upheld this respect for the separation of powers. The courts exercise self-restraint in this regard and we should do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion seeks to interfere with this balance for base party political motives. It speaks volumes about Fine Gael's commitment to the supremacy of the Constitution and the judicial process. For it, the Constitution is supreme until there are new political points to be scored. Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty has, by his important and significant decisions, had a more positive and real impact on the day to day lives of more people than anyone on the Opposition benches. Through such important decisions as the Nolan Transport case we can see how Hugh O'Flaherty held the rights of people and absolute respect for fair legal processes in the highest esteem: &ldquo;The State representing the rest of us ordinary citizens and taxpayers has a very keen interest in seeing the <Col N="918" /> harmonisation of industrial relations. We all stand to lose too much where there is strife and conflict. We should now have advanced sufficiently in our respect for democracy and the rule of law in all its refinements to work out a better way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate in the Seanad on the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, Opposition Senators were compelled to admit that this judgment was enlightened while their colleagues in this House were beating a path to RTE and TV3 to denounce and pour calumny on Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty's integrity and reputation. They should be ashamed. Everyone sympathises with the Ryan family but the suffering caused to the O'Flaherty family is something about which they should be ashamed. The record will show years from now, when somebody is doing a PhD on the subject, the injustice and lack of care for justice which Members of the Opposition showed. They should be ashamed of themselves.</P>

It is not just vindictive but ignorant of him to suggest that Deputy Shatter is a part-time Member of the House. It would be nice if Deputy Carey and other Members could introduce 18 Private Members' Bills and motions as Deputy Shatter has. We should all appreciate the commitment and legal expertise Deputy Shatter has brought to the House. I also acknowledge the work being done by Deputy Brian Lenihan in the committee on constitutional reform. I agree that reforms are needed to deal with the unprecedented situation that occurred and with which the Oireachtas was powerless to deal despite the alarm and concern of the people we represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wished for the urgent introduction of legislation to provide for the ethics, standards and independence which was required then. Members of the committee were keenly aware of the separation of the Executive from the Judiciary. The <Col N="919" /> committee's report was not dealt with so Members on this side of the House are now attempting to bring some form of closure to the matter, not just for ourselves but for the people who still have unanswered questions. Even the sequence of events after the release of Philip Sheedy gives rise to huge concern and a lack of confidence in the integrity of the judicial system and its ability to guarantee justice for everybody. As legislators we have a huge responsibility to uphold that integrity and sense of confidence in the Legislature, legislators and those who implement legislation.</P>
    <P>When the committee lodged its report with the Dáil we wished it to be processed further. I will again read the relevant extracts from the statement I made, as chairman of the committee and with the full agreement of the members of the committee, and from the conclusions the committee reached. I said: </P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this report from our committee presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas confirms that without the co-operation and participation of the principal players, our committee is unable to proceed any further. However, this should not hinder the Houses of the Oireachtas from continuing to make progress on this matter. The outstanding issue at the very least needs to be considered by the all party committee on the Constitution, even to the prospect of having a referendum on a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>The volume of correspondence and comment to members of the committee from the public demonstrates an anger and frustration and a demand for answers surrounding this case.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that I was reporting for an all-party committee and no member of the committee disagreed with that statement. We are not playing politics here.</P>
    <P>The committee considered two options. The first would have been extraordinarily difficult because of the constitutional difficulties and the lack of resources for committees. The second option was a tribunal of inquiry. I will quote from the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights on matters arising from the early release from prison of Mr. Philip Sheedy:</P>
    <P>The second option which suggests itself is the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts. The committee appreciates that there may well be considerable public resistance to the establishment of a further tribunal of inquiry but considers that appropriately narrow terms of reference which included a fixed time for reporting back may go at least some way to allaying concerns in this regard.</P>
    <P>I come now to an issue which has been raised repeatedly and in a destructive way by the other side of the House, as if there were an inter<Col N="920" /> national conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the judges in this State.</P>
    <P>The nature of the matters to be inquired into would appear to require the appointment of a serving or former member of the Judiciary. However, this gives rise to potential difficulty on two counts:</P>
    <P>(a) the impact an appointment would have on the hearing of cases before the courts; and</P>
    <P>(b) the extent to which members of the Judiciary would be personally acquainted with one or more of those involved in the release of Mr. Sheedy.</P>
    <P>The committee is of the opinion that these difficulties could be avoided if a former member of the judiciary of another jurisdiction were appointed as presiding member.</P>
    <P>The report concluded:</P>
    <P>The committee requests that this report be the subject of debate in both Houses and seeks the views of the Oireachtas as to how the outstanding issues can be resolved.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee clearly indicated that there were unanswered questions and that it was powerless in certain respects. It offered an option which is the kernel of the motion. It would go some way towards dealing with the unanswered questions. Some of the participants in the unfortunate affair wished to give evidence before the committee. We should bear in mind that their reputations are left hanging in the balance because they did not get that opportunity. I therefore commend the motion in the most positive terms and I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Shatter, for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, pay tribute to Deputy Shatter for putting down the motion. If he introduced 18 Private Members' Bills as a part-time parliamentarian, I wish he would become a full-time one and introduce even more. The Government has been given a chance to close this question once and for all in the motion. I am struck by the viciousness of the responses of various Ministers, the personal attacks and the defensiveness. Why is the Government so defensive? Of what is it afraid? What is it hiding? Why does it not support the motion or amend it to enable it to proceed in some other fashion while holding its integrity? It strikes me that the Government is hiding something and is afraid of something. That is extremely worrying. We, on this side of the House, want the motion to bring closure to this issue. When a person dies there is a period of mourning and then a period of closure. This is not happening here. The Government is not allowing that to happen. Time and again the opportunity to bring closure to this issue has been presented to Government, but it has not allowed that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> Prior to the summer recess the Government nominated Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank. If there was anything that would have opened up this issue, that was it. I was surprised by the viciousness expressed by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. He questioned why in one week alone 43 articles by 17 journalists referred to the O'Flaherty affair? We did not instigate the O'Flaherty affair? The Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, did that. If the Government had any compassion for the families involved, it would have been far more sensitive. The Taoiseach indicated it was a mistake to do that. Eventually members of the Government were dragged kicking and screaming into saying it was a mistake to do that by the people who represented themselves regarding the European Investment Bank position.</P>
    <P>This is a sad affair. It will not go away. Deputy Briscoe is correct. In 20 or 30 years' time people will be writing PhDs on this subject because it is not closed. Until the Government of the day, irrespective of which Government that will be, instigates some form of inquiry, tribunal or commission on this issue, it will not go away. In 20 years' time television programmes will be made by journalists and others reflecting on unanswered questions from 2000. What a way to start the millennium. When people reflect on this century, this issue will be the highlight of the Government's tenure in office, the O'Flaherty affair and the Sheedy affair. This is for what the Government will be remembered. This is the big issue and the Government is refusing to close it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes said there are many other people whose reputations are in tatters because the Government refuses to allow this affair to be closed. Let this House put forward a mechanism whereby it can be closed, unanswered questions can be answered and people who want to answer questions are allowed to do so, but the Government refuses to do that. Why is that the case? Why do the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Ministers and the Progressive Democrats not allow closure on this issue? This question will continue to be asked for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned narrow political motives. There are none. If there are, the Government &ndash; not us &ndash; has brought them forward. Deputy Barnes mentioned reports of various committees. The former Chief Justice said he went as far as he could but could go no further because he did not have all the facts. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said last night that questions remain to be answered. The fact that questions remain unanswered does not in itself provide jurisdiction. He acknowledged that questions remain unanswered and, while questions remain unanswered, this issue will not be closed and the suffering of all the people involved will continue. That is not fair. I appeal to the Members opposite to join the Opposition in supporting this motion and to <Col N="922" /> ensure the Members work together. Members should not be vicious about such a sensitive issue by attacking other Members who are doing their best in a sensitive way to bring closure to this most important issue. I am appalled at the viciousness of the Members opposite over an issue such as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that his Department set out the facts that it was able to establish. That implies there were facts it was not able to establish. Let us do our utmost to establish the facts. If the judges and all the other people who were involved in this have nothing to hide, let us clear their names, if that can be done. Question marks will hang over them forever unless that is done.</P>

      <P>I, too, support this motion. Events happened so fast here in recent months that one is inclined to forget them. Members of the Government were in a stand-off position over this issue for a week. The Tánaiste would not talk to the Taoiseach and he would not talk to her. We are led to believe the Minister for Finance intervened, the honest broker, and he patched up things. It is worth recalling what the row was about. It was about the Sheedy affair. The Taoiseach told the Tánaiste that he would come into the house and place on record that he had made representations on this case, but he did not do that. That is why the Tánaiste got annoyed and why there was a row in the camp. That is why the Minister for Finance took time off to do the patching up and brought the Government back on the rails once more. When people say that introducing this motion is playing politics with the issue, it is worth noting what was happening on that occasion. Who was playing politics for a whole week? The Tánaiste said on the Six-One News, &ldquo;This is a very serious matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no better Deputy on record inside and outside this House than the Tánaiste when in Opposition. On many nights she stood on the plinth in full glare of camera lights when the rainbow Government was in office &ndash; a decent Government compared with what we have had for the past three years &ndash; and told the people: </P>
      <P>The truth must be told. It is our job to tell the truth. That is what the Progressive Democrats are here to do.</P>
      <P>People forget. Once they sit on the Government benches, everything changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a democracy is being set up, one of the first institutions that must be put in place are courts. If courts are not established, there will not be order. Courts are the basis of a democracy, society or civilisation. The Government has undermined the process of democracy by not proceeding with the inquiry sought in this motion. Any politician who calls himself or herself a democrat would have to support this motion. It is in the interests of the preservation of democracy in our State, which was hard fought for. We send observers throughout the world when elections <Col N="923" /> are being held to establish democracies, yet some Members of this Assembly will not back up this motion to show justice must be administered to all the people at all levels in a fair fashion. The people know that and have said it in many opinion polls. They said it in the ballot box in Tipperary and they will say it at the next general election, and the sooner that is called the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support the motion tabled by Deputy Shatter and other members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, asked where were the Fine Gael members who put their name to this motion. I am present and my name was on it before the list of speakers was drawn up. I did not decide to put my name to this simply because the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation spoke. I am entitled to speak on any issue here that I feel is important to me and on which I wish to make a contribution. I will not be instructed by the Minister or anyone else. I compliment Deputy Shatter on his marvellous contribution as a parliamentarian. It has been a pleasure to work with and support him.</P>
      <P>With regard to this issue, I am taken aback by the viciousness of the Government's response, as are fair-minded people outside this House. Why is it so vicious? Perhaps because it hits a raw nerve. Many Ministers and Government Deputies are no more aware than I why this came about. I want an answer and so do the people. The Government says we are trying to resurrect this matter and to keep it alive. That is not true and shows how far removed from reality the Government is. People are continually talking about the Sheedy affair; how he was released after one year of a four-year sentence handed down after due process. If Mr. Sheedy was a man he would have served his sentence and paid his debt to society and to the Ryan family. The late Mrs. Ryan was a stranger to me, Lord have mercy on her. I never knew her but she was a wife and mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a sad case. It is sad for Mr. Sheedy but he was wrong and had a debt to pay. What is my interest in this? There was a similar case in my constituency without any drink being involved &ndash; a tragic motoring accident with a life lost. After due process a six year sentence was handed down to a young man who manfully served his sentence. He was a model prisoner and used his skills to help out others in prison with less education than him. He was a wonderful young man, terribly remorseful about what happened, and after two and a half years of his sentence his family requested he be allowed out to attend the Confirmation of his youngest brother. They requested three hours of freedom and I was prepared to put my name down that he would have returned to prison, although that would not have been necessary. That young man did not get three minutes, yet Mr. Sheedy ran free after 12 months. Why? <Col N="924" /> Simply because he knew somebody who knew somebody.</P>
    <P>Who was the person he knew and who authorised his release? That is what I and my constituents want to know? Is there a law for one and a different law for another? It stinks and it leaves a bad taste. The Government will not get away with it and it will not leave the agenda until full answers are given. Unlike the tribunals, where people are using every trick in the book to escape giving evidence, people have volunteered to come before an inquiry and to give information to see if we can get to the root of how Mr. Sheedy escaped his sentence and escaped paying his dues to the Ryan family. That would show the law is fair and above board.</P>
    <P>As the law is administered at present it is a matter of who one knows and if one has money. That is what is being said to me. Is that the truth? I cannot say that it is not because I do not know. It is unfair to the Judiciary and casts a shadow on them. It is very serious for democracy that people going to court doubt they will get the same treatment as anyone else and feel that a judge will look at a person's background and in consideration of the status of that person's father or uncle hand down a lenient sentence. Is that the way democracy operates? Is that the slippery slope we are going down? Is that what the Sheedy case points to?</P>
    <P>Decent man that Hugh O'Flaherty was, I do not doubt he believed in his heart he was doing a good turn, but if he made a mistake let him come out and tell us how it was done, who influenced him and why he acted as he did. Those answers have not been given and until they are this issue will not go away.</P>
    <P>The young man I referred to and the many others &ndash; there may be hundreds for all we know &ndash; are entitled to know. They are entitled to a fair answer to a fair question. The Government need not be vicious about this but should come out and give us a straight answer. Then we will let the dead rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Boylan. We do not want to bring this issue up. The reason we are doing so is that the people are outraged about what happened last year. It will not go away. I talk to judges and others in the legal field and they want the good name of their profession restored.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boylan is right. People have always felt the State and the Judiciary were separate and that when someone went to court, nobody could ever talk to a judge. It was something I was told going into politics; one does not get involved in the law. A judge was above the law and made the final decision in matters of law. I was amazed in the context of another debate that after all that has gone on we found Ministers writing to each other to appoint their friends as judges. This is very wrong and cannot go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do we have a position where someone can talk to another person about these matters? We <Col N="925" /> have a two-tier society of the rich and the poor. When the poor go to court they do not have to put a fine in the poorbox; they have to go to Loughan House or Castlerea or Mountjoy prisons. When the rich go to court it is who and what they know that decides how they get on. That is wrong but that is what is happening. That is why the decent people in the Judiciary want this inquiry held. They want to know what happened from the beginning to the end. Until that happens, the people will not be satisfied and will continue to ask what happened with the Sheedy case. That is why this motion was tabled &ndash; to get an inquiry so that the legal profession can investigate this itself, as it is well able to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, criticised Fine Gael for tabling this motion. This is not about the Olympics or places in Sydney. It is about fair play, the truth and justice for everyone, not justice for the rich and justice for the poor. We want justice for everyone. We want to know what happened, from step one to the end. Who interfered with who? Who asked the questions? Who made the decisions? What price was paid? The people have a right to know.</P>
    <P>For 20 years there was talk of certain people having certain things in this country and were it not for an incident in America we would still not know what was going on. Many people in this city knew what was going on but others would not believe it. It is still going on. When The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, was in Opposition she was the conscience of the nation. I am asking the conscience of the nation to ask the Government to hold this inquiry and to let the people know what went on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the Ryan family in relation to this particular case, which was raised as a result of issues that entered the public domain in recent years. Given the tragic nature of this case, it is important that we should seek to address the issues raised by Deputy Shatter in a way which does not inflame the situation further, particularly in light of the personal hurt that has been visited upon many of those involved.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issues raised by Deputy Shatter such as serving the public interest and the principle of accountability being met, one must take cognisance of the fact that, quite apart from the opinions that were expressed by the Chief Justice in his report, the judgment handed down by Judge Matthews in the first instance was reaffirmed and that the serious issues of accountability were addressed in that the careers of two judges came to an end as a result of the Chief Justice's investigation. Those are important considerations in addressing the issue of public confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the public looking at what occurred in this case would have recognised that serious issues were raised which the Chief Justice sought to address in his investigation and that <Col N="926" /> there were a number of serious consequences. On the basis of the public being entitled to witness the principles of accountability being observed, it is indicative that, because a Supreme Court judge and a High Court judge resigned as a result of this series of events, the consequences were such as to meet the requirements of the situation.</P>
    <P>While, as stated in the Chief Justice's report, Judge O'Flaherty's involvement came out of a humanitarian interest, the judge was prepared to resign, not on the basis of that being a wrongdoing in itself &ndash; he was not exercising a judicial function in so doing &ndash; but because his involvement was open to misinterpretation. Members of the Judiciary have set a standard in terms of actions which may be open to misinterpretation and Members in this part of the Oireachtas understand that such standards are difficult to meet. However, it is clear that the standard was met on this occasion because the judge recognised that his involvement could be misinterpreted. As the Chief Justice outlined, it was not a wrongdoing in the exercise of a judicial function but because his involvement was open to misinterpretation which brought about the resignation of a Supreme Court judge.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is a difference of opinion &ndash; a difference which will remain &ndash; between Judge Cyril Kelly and Judge Matthews, both in terms of their recollection of a telephone call and other events and in relation to how the issue was handled from their own perspectives. I am not convinced that could be resolved by an inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the resignation of Judge Cyril Kelly sought to meet the public concerns which were expressed at the time. In terms of upholding the integrity of the Judiciary, its public standing and the esteem in which it is held and emphasising and underlining its independence, it is important also to point out that these significant actions were taken as a result of an investigation by the Chief Justice in relation to the way this case was dealt with and that the understanding by Judge Kelly of a precedent which was not agreed to by the Chief Justice meant that he too would be terminating his career as a judge and facing the consequences of his actions. That in no way is meant to equate or apply equivalence to what happened to the judges to the trauma and loss experienced by the Ryan family.</P>
    <P>The motion seems to justify the inquiry being sought by Deputy Shatter and the Fine Gael Party on the basis that public confidence has been undermined. However, the public must consider the reaction of the Chief Justice, the nature of his report, the steps taken by the personalities involved in this case as a result of its publication and those taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of acknowledging the need for reform of the administration of the justice system to make it more effective, transparent and modern through the establishment of the Courts Service. A number of matters flow from the latter, including the need to ensure <Col N="927" /> better training and introduce a code of conduct. As far as I am aware, Article 35.4 of the Constitution has never been judicially interpreted and there is a need to deal with the constitutional problem that only stated misbehaviour can be punished by the Oireachtas. There is no option available to the Oireachtas in circumstances of this nature other than that severe sanction has led the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to recommend that this issue be addressed in order that justice will be done for all concerned.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view it is a question of achieving a balance in terms of deciding whether the public interest would be served by a further inquiry into this matter. In my opinion the principles of accountability have been adhered to as a result of the resignation of the judges concerned. It is our responsibility to ensure that the circumstances surrounding this case are not repeated by improving the structures and accountability procedures which apply to the Judiciary while recognising the need for the separation of powers, a principle which is central to the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In bringing to a conclusion what is a serious and important debate, I thank all my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party and the members of the Labour Party who contributed to the debate and who are supportive of the motion. It is most regrettable that, in the context of a serious issue which goes to the heart of how we deal with major difficulties in our constitutional democracy affecting the Judiciary, from most speakers opposite we have been subjected to political pantomime and buffoonery of a nature which is insulting to other Members of the House. Their actions substantially undermine their expressed concern for the awful tragedy that befell the Ryan family and, as I accepted yesterday, for the personal tragedy, of a very different nature and at a different level, visited upon the judges involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, obtained a sense of how foolish the contributions of his colleagues had been before he entered the House. It is quite notable that, while I may not agree with his conclusions, he delivered a serious and straightforward contribution which ignored most of what is contained in his prepared script. I thank him for that and I wish his colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for fun and sport, Deputy McDaid, had treated this issue more seriously. It would be nice if Deputy McDaid did not treat this Chamber as if it was the Gaiety Theatre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform arrived at an extraordinary hypothesis last evening. We are saying that there are unanswered questions which must be addressed. That has been acknowledged in every report that <Col N="928" /> deals directly with the Sheedy affair to which the Minister referred. I quoted from the Chief Justice's report where it was stated that there were unanswered questions the Chief Justice could not resolve which would require different procedures.</P>
    <P>Earlier this evening Deputy Barnes referred to the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on this issue. She, with the agreement of all members of that committee, came before the House and referred to the need for an inquiry. The committee acknowledged that it lacked the capacity and ability to obtain answers to the unanswered questions. It did not have the parliamentary support, procedures or legislation required to enable it to do so. The committee recommended that such an inquiry be conducted by a judge from outside the State. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seemed to ignore that point. He thought that my raising that as an issue was an insult to the Judiciary for which I should apologise.</P>
    <P>We have been well served by the Judiciary. It does a difficult job and the shock of the events relating to the Sheedy case derives from the high esteem in which it is held by all Members of the House. However, it was the view of the joint Oireachtas committee, across party lines, a view supported by the Minister's colleagues, that should there be an inquiry there was a very good reason it should be chaired by a judge from outside the State, not only to do with the pressure the Judiciary is under with the existing tribunals and the backlog of cases in the courts, but also because it would place current members of the Judiciary in an invidious position to conduct such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Minister facilitated some of his backbench colleagues such as Deputy Pat Carey who ran the same line. It was also in the script of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, but he obviously heard what Deputy Barnes said, corrected it and left it out of his script.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious issue, not one for slapstick or the usual party political posturing, of which all of us in this House are guilty on occasion. This is an issue to which the general public wants answers. It derives from events which rightly caused public outrage. We had the unprecedented event in this democracy of two senior judges resigning leaving questions unanswered. As I said last night, the Minister acknowledged in this House on 20 April 1999 that the only way in which we would get answers to these questions was by holding an inquiry. In its own report his Department stated that, in the context of the conclusions it had reached, questions were left unanswered &ldquo;that will no doubt be raised in the period ahead&rdquo;. I presume the Minister sanctioned the publication of that report. There is not one single report into this affair which does not recognise that there are unanswered questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> What reason does the Minister give for not holding an inquiry? The reason is that he is not sure that the holding of an inquiry would achieve results which eluded previous inquiries, in other words, he personally does not know anything that is not already in the public domain which would justify the holding of an inquiry. On that basis we should never hold inquiries into anything. If anyone in public life engages in serious misconduct, we should ignore it. If they resign, we should say, &ldquo;Good on you; off you go, we do not want to know why you did what you did&rdquo;. Is that the ethos that we want? Is that the new Fianna Fáil concept of openness, transparency and accountability? Is this the result of lessons learned and another example of the philosophy of climbing up every tree to find out what is going on, except that when we get to the top of the tree, we should wear blinkers and not look down to see what is beneath us? It is an extraordinary approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that there are fundamental questions to be answered about the Sheedy affair. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, said that, on balance, there is no point in holding an inquiry. The overwhelming majority believe that we should get answers as to why Cyril Kelly, when a judge in the Circuit Court, saw fit in a hearing which lasted no longer than one minute to release from prison someone who had been sentenced to prison by another judge as a consequence of causing the death of another person on the road in a case which had been concluded a year earlier in the Circuit Court, where the Circuit Court had no role to play of any nature whatsoever. That is the nub of it, the central issue.</P>
    <P>A sitting judge of the Circuit Court, Judge Joseph Matthews, who is not accused of misconduct of any nature whatsoever &ndash; I do not want to say anything which could in any way damage his reputation, credibility or personal integrity &ndash; presents a series of events concerning the original sentencing of Philip Sheedy and former judge Cyril Kelly's involvement in the Sheedy case that is totally at variance with what former judge Cyril Kelly told the Chief Justice. Is a sitting judge of the Circuit Court not entitled to have an inquiry to determine what did occur and who is telling the truth? Are we, in this republic, not entitled to have a judicial system which is not hanging under a cloud as a result of the events in the Sheedy case? Are we not entitled to ensure, if there are allegations of misconduct or improper conduct in public life which result in people resigning, the full story becomes known? We are.</P>
    <P>To what were we subjected last night? We were subjected to political slapstick from the Minister and, tonight, to the eccentric contribution of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Where are the Progressive Democrats? Not a single member of the Progressive Democrats has contributed to this debate. The Progressive Democrats have had psycho-political difficulties in coming to terms with this issue. At various stages the Tánaiste wanted judges to resign, then <Col N="930" /> she did not want to talk to the Taoiseach, then she wanted one of the judges who did resign but would not explain himself to be sent to the European Investment Bank and then she wanted the person she was proposing for the European Investment Bank to stand down. The Progressive Democrats, who said that they wanted to know the full story, will now presumably vote with the Government to prevent an inquiry being held, but lack the courage to come into the House to explain themselves. They are invisible.</P>
    <P>Does anyone know where is the leader of the radical party, the Attorney General? Is he advising the Fianna Fáil Party to vote against an inquiry? Is he advising the Progressive Democrats to vote against an inquiry? Is he advising the Government to vote against an inquiry? Which role is he playing? One can imagine the enthusiasm for an inquiry from the Tánaiste and the then Deputy McDowell three or four years ago in this House. One can imagine them jumping up and down demanding answers and accountability and insisting that the public is entitled to know, as it is, but where are they tonight? They are completely and utterly invisible. Presumably, they will creep into the Chamber, hide themselves among the crowd when the division bells ring and move slowly up into the lobbies to vote down our proposal in the hope that their presence will not be noticed. No doubt tomorrow or the next day in addressing a meeting outside the House the Attorney General will be critical of some other group. Yesterday he was critical of the Garda; presumably he will be critical of someone else for some other worthy reason that he wants to articulate.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been talking about accountability in public life. It talks about a new type of politics. Fianna Fáil has been grossly embarrassed &ndash; rightly so &ndash; by the behaviour of a whole series of Members of this House, Deputies Foley and Lawlor and former Deputy Ray Burke, but where has it learned the lessons? Where does the rhetoric match the reality? We know that they do not match. The reality is that if the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats truly want to restore credibility to politics and public faith in the institutions of the State, they will support the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <P>The motion is not before the House for any party political reason. It is before the House to bring closure to an issue which requires closure, to ensure the full story can become known and the people involved can get on with their lives, but for party political reasons the Government parties will vote it down. I predict that this will be one of the issues on which the electorate will visit retribution on Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the next general election. It will be one of the issues to which people will point as highlighting the cynical behaviour of the Government, the fact that neither party in Government can be believed when it promises better politics and suggests that it will clean up its act. The reality is that they are endemically incapable of <Col N="931" /> doing so. At this stage the Progressive Democrats Party is no more than an arm of the Fianna Fáil Party. We have not yet worked out whether they are an official or a provisional arm.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are at this stage intellectually consumed by Fianna Fáil and we must wait to see whether they will also be physically consumed by that party. Perhaps when Deputy Bertie Ahern ceases to be Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil, the Attorney General will <Col N="932" /> have given up on the Progressive Democrats and will apply for his job. Either way, the credibility of the Government parties which speak about restoring faith in our democratic institutions will disappear into the sand this evening if they vote down this motion. I invite them not to vote it down. I extend to them the opportunity to save themselves politically but I do not have faith that they are capable of doing so.</P>

      <P>The racing industry is an important asset and the Government's proposal to establish the board of horseracing Ireland is a major step in the development of that industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to emphasise to the Minister or the House how important that industry is. Some people estimate that between 20,000 and 25,000 people are engaged across the racing sector. In drawing up the legislation, however, the Government has not given an opportunity to Members of the House to voice their interests and concerns. It is disappointing that when this issue comes before the House in the form of legislation, Members do not have an opportunity to express their views about the future of the industry. Will the greyhound industry also be included in the new legislative plans that are being put in place? Greyhound racing has become a major sport which forms part of the general leisure industry.</P>
      <P>Longford is in the process of retaining its dog track which I hope will benefit when funding is allocated so that the local greyhound stadium can be developed. Small courses in the midlands, such as Roscommon and Kilbeggan, have made major strides over the years. Sligo, to a certain extent, has fallen behind and is one of the tracks that needs a major boost. It is important to retain that track in the north-west.</P>
      <P>I was shocked to read a racing correspondent who wrote that, when Fine Gael returns to power, it will be bad news for the racing industry. I said, &ldquo;Fair play to the spin doctors; they're doing their job&rdquo;. The Minister of State knows that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, opened stands and facilities in his first two years in office, all of which were put in place during the rainbow Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Belton, for raising this important issue as it gives me an opportunity to say a few words on it. I reiterate what he said about the strong commitment of the Fine Gael Party to the racing industry. Everyone can be assured that Fine Gael in Government will put the maximum amount of resources into racing which is good not only for social life in rural Ireland but for the rural economy and the economy in general. Deputy Belton highlighted the number of jobs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> I also support what Deputy Belton said about the need for statements to be made in the House before the legislation comes forward. I would appreciate if the Minister of State raised with the Government Whip the possibility of setting aside two or three hours some Thursday to allow Members make statements about the proposed changes. I certainly welcome them and congratulate the Minister of State and his ministerial colleagues on the effort they have made. It would be helpful if, in advance of the legislation being presented and debated, Ministers had an opportunity to listen to a wide range of views from Members. Perhaps the Minister of State might take that on board.</P>
    <P>The changes are welcome, they are good for the racing industry and will receive support from all sides of the House. I hope that everyone will now be able to co-operate. As the Minister of State knows, there was difficulty in getting everyone to work together, but that has been resolved. Co-operation is the key word for the future in Irish racing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Belton for his recognition of the good choice of Senator Cosgrave and myself on the horse selected. Unfortunately, Deputy McGahon cannot share the same selection choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a long way to go and we never pulled a horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We never pulled ours either. If someone has ten successes out of 11 runs, one is doing very well.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the horse breeding, training and racing industry is a very important one. It contributes substantially to the generation of income from valuable farm enterprise, to employment, tourism, rural development, social, community and cultural life and to the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>The sector has undergone major structural, organisational and legislative changes in recent years. The Irish Horseracing Authority was established in 1994 and in 1996 it produced the industry's first strategic plan covering almost every aspect of the sector. The State has provided a substantial and increasing financial contribution to the implementation of this plan each year since. The result of all this has been to turn around the fortunes of the industry from virtual stagnation in the mid-1990s to considerable growth in recent years in all the key performance statistics for the sector, where the targets in the IHA's plan have not only been met but are being surpassed on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, continued and sustained development is essential. Together with the Minister for Finance, we have over the past year examined closely the long-term future of the racing industry. We have paid particular attention, particularly in the organisational structures servicing the sector and income sources funding the indus<Col N="938" /> try, to what further improvements can be made to ensure the industry reaches its full potential and retains and continually improves upon its market share in a very competitive leisure and entertainment sector. The Minister for Finance indicated last year that he would be prepared to examine the existing financial provisions to support racing in the event of the horseracing industry agreeing to establish a new single governing structure.</P>
    <P>Following a period of extensive consultations and negotiations with the organisations involved in the industry in the first half of this year, the Minister for Finance and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, announced detailed proposals for the future organisation and funding of Irish racing in July 2000. The aim of these proposals was to provide a sound basis for the ongoing development of all parts of Irish racing and to position the industry at all levels to meet the challenges which lie ahead. Central to this was a unified administrative and financial structure.</P>
    <P>The aim was to achieve desirable rationalisation, efficiencies and other potential improvements in the overall operation of Irish racing as a whole and the provision of a secure financial base. This financial security would be achieved into the future by securing for the industry the revenue coming from the tax on off-course betting which goes to the Exchequer. This will equate to the proceeds of the 5% tax on off-course betting allocated on a 4:1 ratio between the horse and greyhound industries. The greyhound sector has made spectacular progress in recent years and this additional funding will enable it to achieve further development.</P>
    <P>While the proposals were generally welcomed through the horse and greyhound industries, the Turf Club and the Association of Irish Racecourses, AIR, expressed some reservations. At a meeting with the AIR on 13 September, agreement was reached with that body on the main issues of concern to it. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, with the Minister for Finance, met representatives of the Turf Club on 19 October and a basis for the resolution of the outstanding issues of concern to the Turf Club was agreed.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the road since the announcement of our proposals has been long, to say the least. Consultations have been extensive and negotiations went through a very difficult period. This is as would be expected when the level of change being proposed is so great. However, the importance of the proposals for the future of the horse and greyhound industries and all those depending on them for their livelihood was accepted by all. I am glad to be able to record the success of the agreement reached with all parties. We are in discussion with the Minister for Finance on the new funding arrangements and are making the arrangements to facilitate the introduction of the required legislation for the establishment of the new horseracing body as <Col N="939" /> soon as possible. I look forward to that Bill and believe it is a success for the industry, the people involved, the racing public and punters, including Deputy McGahon.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Occupational Therapy Assessments.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My concerns relate mainly to senior citizens served by the Old County Road Eastern Regional Health Authority clinic which serves a large area covering parts of Dublin 12 and 6. Delays refer to stair rails, showers, shower fittings, house extensions and wheelchairs for the disabled, elderly and frail people who cannot even get an assessment.</P>
      <P>I was told recently that there is a priority one list in Old County Road which deals with people as soon as possible, whatever that is, a priority two list which says they will be dealt with within a year &ndash; some priority &ndash; and a third priority list of people who will be assessed within two years. I know of cases of people who are confined to their homes, unable to use the stairs or bath, unable to move around or unable to get to the shops because they have not been assessed for a wheelchair or a fitting or some other basic item which would allow them use their homes. At the last count, there were 1,400 such people in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area alone.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the health board on 9 March 2000 to make representations on behalf of a named person in Kimmage, who was seeking a visit from the occupational therapy unit to assess her application for an invalid bathroom, which had already been approved by Dublin Corporation in December 1998. She rang Old County Road clinic, to be told she would have to wait another year or two before they could come to assess her. My office rang in March to be told she was not even on the list.</P>
      <P>A large number of constituents have told me about delays in receiving visits from the occupational therapy unit in Old County Road in recent years. I have not received similar complaints about other areas in the city. There is a specific and real need in this area, which is by no means the most affluent in the country. I urge the Minister to take steps to deal with this.</P>
      <P>I pursued the case of a man from Drimnagh who cannot have an assessment carried out. I received a letter from the health board about this man on 8 February 2000 which stated the occupational therapy department had confirmed the man named was on a priority three waiting list and that the current waiting period was two years. The letter went on to say that if the situation deteriorated he could telephone the occupational therapy department any Tuesday to discuss his case with a therapist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very serious problem in relation to secondary care. We have a waiting list of 31,000, if we are to accept the Minister's figures, which I think are very optimistic and do not take account of the fact there is a waiting list to get on the <Col N="940" /> waiting list. These people are struggling not to have to go into institutional care or hospital. However, they are being left for long periods awaiting assessment and are becoming prisoners in their own homes for the sake of a stair rail, a shower fitting, a wheelchair or a minor extension. Those people should be able to freely enjoy their homes.</P>
    <P>If any Member of this House or any member of our families were asked to wait two years for an assessment we would go through the roof. However, this is the routine treatment of frail and old people in the Dublin 12 area, particularly in the Old County Road clinic. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, if he is not in a position to respond tonight on the specific issue of the Old County Road clinic, to communicate with me in writing, telling me the specific problem there. This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gay Mitchell for raising this issue. As the Deputy is aware the provision of occupational therapy services to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the relevant health board and, in this case, the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the regional chief executive of the authority that two issues which affect provision of occupational therapy services are increasing demand, coupled with recruitment difficulties. In relation to the former, I am advised that the decision by people to remain in their own homes and avail of occupational therapy, together with the complexity of cases and problems arising out of requests to receive treatment at home, has placed increased demands on the service.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the regional chief executive has informed me that the difficulty in recruiting occupational therapists has also contributed to delays. The authority states that the three area health boards are making every effort to address this problem through active recruitment campaigns.</P>
      <P>On 30 August 2000 my Department commissioned a workforce planning survey to report on the prospective supply and demand for occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists between now and 2015. This report, which will be prepared by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, will be presented by end of 2000 and will address the number of additional training places required for these professions. Through the Higher Education Authority, the possibility of increasing the number of training colleges, as well as training places, will be addressed as a result of the findings of this survey. In the meantime, following contacts between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science, the number of occupational therapist training places has been increased by five places this year and a further additional five places per annum will be provided over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group report on health professionals recommended that talks commence <Col N="941" /> between employers and staff in relation to the creation of a clinical specialist post for the therapy grades, including occupational therapy. The creation of this post would allow for a new grade of clinical specialist and allow for career progression for those who do not wish to move into management. It would also ensure that clinical expertise is not lost to the professions. Good progress has been made to date in talks with the trade union IMPACT in relation to the detail of these posts, that is, qualification for the post, job description etc.</P>
    <P>The expert group also recommended that grading structures be examined and has put forward new criteria for the upgrading of occupational therapy posts from basic grade to senior. A survey of all employers has been undertaken with a view to identifying these posts and my aim is to put this new structure in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to point out that additional revenue funding provided to services for older people has been increased significantly in recent years. In 1998 the additional amount provided by the Government was £7 million. In 1999 the amount of additional funding was £16 million and in 2000 the figure has risen to £23.6 million. When nursing home subventions are included, this investment will total nearly £30 million. A proportion of the development funding available this year has been targeted at the provision of additional community supports, that is, nursing and paramedical posts. It is intended to improve these community supports in the coming years, leading to an enhancement of service provision.</P>
    <P>This Government has also increased significantly the funding for physical and sensory disability services and, since coming into office, has provided additional funding of just over £72 million for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. This additional funding includes a total of approximately £32 million additional ongoing revenue, £5 million provided in 1998, £9 million in 1999 and approximately £18 million this year, for the maintenance and development of services, including paramedical services, for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services in the sector are decided by the health boards, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services.</P>
    <P>I will try to return to the Deputy on the particular issue he raised with me.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cork City Youth Homelessness.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. I also thank the Ministers of State for being here to listen to what I have to say. It makes a big difference when the relevant Minister is in the Chamber, particularly when one of them is from Cork, the city I am speaking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> Modern Ireland has much to be proud of. As a small country, with rapidly growing prosperity, we continue to attract foreign investment and recognition. Consecutive Governments, including this one, deserve recognition and praise for their economically smart policies and broad education programmes.</P>
    <P>However, if one looks hard enough behind the glowing economic indicators that we all enjoy citing at times, one will see dark, murky hideaways in Irish society that have not seen even a glimmer of the light of this so-called prosperity. It is the State's responsibility to ensure that everyone's quality of life improves as the country grows in wealth.</P>
    <P>One of the most damning examples of the State's neglect is in the area of homelessness, particularly youth homelessness. Yesterday, Focus Ireland gave a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs informing us of a study it had completed recently into young people who had been in the care of the State. It showed that the link between homelessness and people who have lived in the care of the State is much stronger than anyone could have expected.</P>
    <P>The research confirmed that one-third of young people living in the care of health boards and over half of those leaving schools for young offenders experienced homelessness or time in detention centres within the first six months of their release. By the time they have been out of care for two years the situation is worse. Two-thirds of them have experienced homelessness and a quarter of them have been in detention. This is a scandal and proof of the failure of successive Governments to adequately support the most vulnerable young people in society.</P>
    <P>As I have limited time in which to speak I will concentrate primarily on the homeless issue in Cork city. There has been a 40% increase in the numbers sleeping rough in Cork city in the past 12 months. Some 80% of the homeless have medical problems yet only 30% have medical cards, despite the fact that many of them have no form of income. The age profile, perhaps the most worrying aspect of all, of the homeless people in Cork has changed dramatically and is constantly getting younger. There is a reducing number of volunteers willing to work to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months, the Simon Community, the largest supplier of emergency shelter in Cork, has had to turn away more than 65 young males under the age of 18. It is not allowed to take them in because they are under the age of 18. Those 65 young people must sleep in doorways or along the docks in Cork.</P>
    <P>I recognise that solving the problem of homelessness is far more complex than merely providing more sheltered accommodation and hostels in city centres. There are nearly always tragic circumstances and reasons for people being without a home that are complex and require medium and long-term solutions. I recognise the work the <Col N="943" /> Minister of State is trying to do in this area. However, when I see a voluntary organisation such as the Simon Community, which is making such a huge impact on reintegrating the homeless into society as well as providing emergency shelter, under threat of closure because of lack of funds to pay its staff, I cannot accept it, particularly when there is so much funding available to the Government. Due to the reduction in the numbers of volunteers staff must be employed by the Simon Community. As a result it had a deficit of £172,000. This year it is estimated the deficit will be £200,000. I want an assurance from the Minister that if and when we look for funding to keep the Simon Community afloat and ensure its work continues, this Government will not be found wanting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney not just for raising the issue but for his reasoned and understanding contribution and the fact that he recognises that homelessness is a serious social issue. It is also a very complex one involving the inter-relationship between social and economic factors. Recognising this, the Government published a strategy in May this year aimed at tackling homelessness. This strategy, called Homelessness &ndash; an Integrated Strategy, aims to tackle all aspects of homelessness in an integrated manner. The strategy represents a cross-departmental approach to the problems of homelessness and clearly recognises that homelessness cannot be addressed solely in a housing context. The strategy emphasises the need for a comprehensive approach involving health and welfare and support to enable homeless persons to reintegrate into local communities and to prevent them becoming homeless in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main elements of the strategy are as follows. A homeless forum will be set up in each county for the delivery of homeless services. It will be made up of representatives from the local authorities, the health board and the voluntary bodies operating in the county. Three year action plans will be drawn up in all local authorities and health boards to assist in the formulation of a coherent, comprehensive and effective response to homelessness. More accommodation of a suitable type and of greater variety is to be provided. Settlement and outreach programmes are to be set up to help homeless persons back into independent living. Capital spending over the next five years is to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million to provide suitable accommodation. Additional current funding of £6 million per annum will be available from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to fund voluntary services, increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation and establish settlement and outreach services. Additional funding of £6 million will be available to the Department of Health and Children to fund the <Col N="944" /> provision of in-house care in hostels providing accommodation to homeless people. Each health board is to carry out an assessment of the needs of adult homeless in its area.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the strategy is the clarification of the responsibilities of local authorities and health boards. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, through the local authorities, will fund the cost of settlement and outreach workers and will also fund the cost of additional accommodation. The Department of Health and Children, through the health boards, will fund the cost of providing care. It is also drafting a preventative strategy aimed at reducing the risk of homelessness among those leaving institutional care, mentioned by Deputy Coveney, who are identified as a high risk group for homelessness. Earlier this summer I sanctioned funding for the mid-western region to carry out a project and develop after care plans for children who are in its care to ensure they do not become homeless. I have asked the chief executive officers in all the health boards to ensure that children in care get the benefit of after care plans.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board received additional funding of £75,000 this year to fund targeted services for adult homelessness. I am aware that the Simon Community has recently requested funding from the Southern Health Board for the provision of in-house care and staffing and the board is considering this request in the context of its three year action plan to tackle homelessness in the region.</P>
    <P>The Simon Community in Cork also received capital funding of £1.164 million from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for a sheltered housing development in 1999 and receives funding of approximately £170,000 each year from the local authority.</P>
    <P>As regards youth homelessness, health boards have a responsibility under the Child Care Act, 1991, in relation to homeless children. In general, when homeless children and young people come to the attention of a health board every effort is made to reunite them with their family or have them placed in foster care or residential care as appropriate. Social work support, advice, information, financial support and counselling and mediation for families and individuals is offered.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came to office in 1997 an additional allocation of approximately £60 million in revenue on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of child care and family support services including youth homelessness services. Work on the national youth homeless strategy is progressing and I hope to publish the strategy by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Southern Health Board specifically, since 1995 it has operated a homeless adolescent unit with a dedicated social work service providing direct social work support from two designated social workers for youth homelessness, access to a range of supported and independent accommodation options, financial supports for living allowances, food and meals, <Col N="945" /> laundry, travel, rent or other accommodation costs and education or recreation fees, support in identifying, securing and maintaining young people in independent living opportunities and referral services to other para-medical, medical or support services.</P>
    <P>Additional grants of £180,000 in 1999 and £125,000 have been made available by the Department of Health and Children to the Southern Health Board to further develop its youth homeless services. These include the appointment of a senior social worker to the homeless adolescent unit, the refurbishment and development of a hostel providing medium term care accommodation for homeless girls which is expected to be completed shortly and the creation of a social work post dealing with teenage pregnancy and sexual health promotion which will be attached to the homeless adolescent service. The board also plans to create two further social work posts, one community child care worker post and to increase the number of supported accommodation places available for homeless young people.</P>
    <P>On the issue of a short-term hostel for adolescent boys, raised by Deputy Coveney, the Southern Health Board has informed the Department of Health and Children that discussions are at an advanced stage with a service provider to use an existing building for this purpose. Funding is in place for this unit and a successful candidate has been identified to manage the service and is expected to take up the post in the near future. I hope volunteers will continue to give generously of their time to match the work being done by the voluntary and statutory organisations.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Waste Management.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for his attendance at this debate and I hope he will convey my comments to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who probably holds the purse strings in this matter.</P>
      <P>This is an urgent issue for Limerick city. The local authorities in the mid-west, Limerick city and county, Clare and Kerry, have supported the waste management plan, including &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle. It is probably the only region where every local authority has voted in favour of the plan. We are anxious to implement it but we are faced with costs which are insurmountable unless we are given committed Government support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that waste management is a matter for local authorities but what can a local authority do if it cannot afford to implement its policies and, in this case, Government policy? We want to achieve the greening of Limerick. Limerick was the first local authority to introduce a pilot composting scheme and it hopes to extend it next year. There is extensive use of composting cones, which the corporation sells for home composting, and bring banks have been extended significantly in accord<Col N="946" /> ance with Government policy. We have also begun a kerbside collection in one area. The corporation also takes newspapers for shredding and other recyclables for which there is a loss in financial terms.</P>
    <P>There was a proposal from a Fianna Fáil councillor at the last meeting of the environmental policy committee that grass cut by the corporation on public open spaces should be collected for composting but the reply from the relevant official was that there was no money to do that. We have agreed to seek specific funding from the Department for it. As there was not enough money to run the collection service last year, the corporation ceased collecting bins in July and the public is now charged by private collectors. People are not only charged for ordinary bins but also for green composting bins, again because of cost. People who are complying with Government policy by separating their rubbish should not be penalised for doing so. However, the corporation says the cost of running the scheme means it cannot subvent it sufficiently to be able to provide it free to householders. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>Why is so little of the £650 million in the national plan for waste infrastructure designated for recycling? I believe it is as little as £50 million. We cannot implement the policies in the policy document, &ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo;, because we cannot afford to. Limerick's debt increased last year from £3.6 million to £5.5 million despite the private collection of rubbish. The Minister will say that extra funds were allocated to local authorities in July but Limerick city only got the princely sum of £138,000 while neighbouring county councils got approximately £1 million each. In the recently announced local government fund, Limerick got an increase of 12.5% while they got nearly twice that. The overall increases to local authorities this year has been put at almost 29% but Limerick got just a little over 12.5%. Why is that? This local government fund comes from motor taxation revenue which was ring fenced for local authorities by Deputy Howlin when he was the Minister. That money must be spent on local authorities.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister examine on its merits the financial case for Limerick Corporation. Since its tip closed the cost to dump a ton of rubbish, which the corporation pays to the county council, has increased to £40. It was only £9 when the corporation had its own facility. Clare County Council is experiencing a similar problem and will have to bring its rubbish outside the county.</P>
    <P>The rate increase is capped at 9% so Limerick does not have the option of raising extra funds in that area. There also appears to be no intention to extend the boundary despite the fact that there is under consideration a request for a boundary extension. Limerick's boundaries are extremely tight. Many of the suburbs and industrial and commercial parts of Limerick are now in the county so the city derives no benefit from them. The city has constantly growing needs and is financially and spatially strangled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> I urge the Minister to look at the efforts being made in Limerick to implement environmental policies and the impossibility of doing that while the city is so under funded. It is not a case that there is no money in the Exchequer or that there are no examples in European countries which are much further ahead of Ireland in terms of recycling. Limerick needs the funding to put the structures in place to implement Government policy. I hope the Minister will respond positively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Limerick Corporation and the other three local authorities which jointly made the waste management plan for the mid-west region. To date, regrettably, this is one of only two regional waste plans which have been adopted by all of the local authorities concerned. I hope the remaining regions will bring the current planning process to a satisfactory conclusion within an acceptable time frame.</P>
      <P>The proposed regional plans aim to achieve the ambitious waste recovery targets specified in the policy statement &ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo; and, over the period ahead, we will provide practical support and assistance to local authorities as they address the delivery of the services and infrastructure provided for in these plans.</P>
      <P>The mid-west regional plan provides for recycling of more than 46% of total waste arising by 2013 to be achieved by improved waste collection services and the development of an integrated package of waste infrastructure including: extended networks of bring banks, civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; materials recovery facilities and biological treatment capacity. Providing new infrastructure on the scale that is needed represents a major undertaking. The national development plan anticipates some £650 million of capital investment in waste management in the period to 2008 and operational costs may also be expected to increase significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> Major infrastructural requirements can best be addressed through the establishment of public private partnerships delivering integrated regional solutions. In addition, local authorities will provide or arrange for the provision of supporting waste recovery infrastructure as well as segregation at source and separate collection of recyclable and organic materials for waste recovery purposes.</P>
    <P>I place strong emphasis on the need to give effect to &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle in financing the provision of waste services by or on behalf of local authorities. Within each region it is essential that local authorities move rapidly towards recouping the full cost of the waste services they provide by means of use related waste charges levied on all waste producers, including households and commercial and business concerns.</P>
    <P>Within this overall context, EU-Exchequer support of some £100 million will be available under the NDP in respect of the provision of waste recovery infrastructure and my Department is currently finalising proposals for the delivery of this assistance. Broadly speaking, we envisage that financial support will be made available towards planning and procurement costs associated with the delivery of major regional infrastructure and the capital cost of recycling infrastructure, for example, civic amenity sites and materials recovery facilities provided for in regional and local plans. This subvention of capital costs will be delivered under the regional operational programmes for the period to 2006.</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming policy statement on waste prevention and recovery the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I will outline a range of measures that will be undertaken to minimise waste generation and ensure a sustained expansion in national recycling performance. Overall, local authorities will receive a significant level of financial assistance and support in their implementation of the waste recovery and recycling objectives of the waste management plans currently being adopted.</P>

      <P>The number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities for each of the years 1995 to 1999 was as follows: 1995, 3,687 units; 1996, 3,504 units; 1997, 3,203 units; 1998, 3,290; and 1999, 3,713 units. By the end of the year I expect local authorities will have some 6,000 units either under construction or being acquired &ndash; by far the highest level of activity under the local authority housing programme for many years.</P>
      <P>In response to the increased level of housing need, I have taken a range of measures to assist local authorities to expand their housing programmes and to expand overall social housing output. This has included the introduction of a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme for the period 2000 to 2003. I have also considerably expanded the voluntary housing programme. In addition, as part of its Action on Housing, the Government increased the local authority housing programme by an extra 1,000 units in each year from 2001 to 2006. I propose to notify local authorities shortly of the allocation of 3,000 of these extra units for the period covering the multi-annual programme up to 2003. The four year multi-annual programme will, therefore, increase from 22,000 to 25,000 housing units. I have also encouraged local authorities to front load their programmes as much as possible to meet the increased level of need. In effect this allows local authorities to commence as many local authority housing projects as they can at the earliest possible time.</P>

Article 9 of the directive requires member states to take account of the principle of the recovery of costs of water services having regard to the social, environmental and economic effects of the recovery. As I indicated in the statement accompanying Ireland's vote in favour of the adoption of the directive I am satisfied, following legal consultations, that the directive accommodates the case advanced by Ireland in relation to the domestic sector, enabling that sector to continue to be exempt from water charges in accordance with established practice.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in June 1998 I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) General Policy Directive (Shopping), 1998, setting a 3,000 square metre net retail floorspace cap on supermarkets. I also made planning regulations to provide that a change of use of any premises to a supermarket exceeding 3,000 square metres net retail floorspace would require planning permission. In addition, given the complexity of the issues involved, I announced the commissioning of a study to examine the relevant issues in an Irish context with a view to preparing comprehensive planning guidelines on retail development.</P>
      <P>The question of such a moratorium on retail development was the subject of widespread debate and speculation at that time including reference to different specific floor area limits. In all these circumstances, the question of any communication of a proposed decision would not constitute a matter requiring further inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to representations, I received two representations from the first-named person and <Col N="951" /> one representation from the second-named person. The persons making these representations copied their letters to the Taoiseach. I spoke to the first person named by the Deputy and suggested that he contact the Department formally, which he subsequently did. These representations were among a large number of representations I received at the time on retail development and planning.</P>
    <P>The study and the draft retail planning guidelines subsequently prepared by the consultants Roger Tym &amp; Partners confirmed the appropriateness of the 3,000 square metre net cap in all of the State except Dublin, where the consultants recommended the cap be increased to 3,500 square metres. At the time of publication of the draft guidelines in April 1999, I announced that a further study on the economic impact of implementation of the draft guidelines would be commissioned. This further study by Goodbody Economic Consultants showed that economies of scale in the food retail sector were exhausted at a store size of 2,000 square metres and that the implementation of the caps will have no direct effect on retailing costs.</P>

      <P>In the recently launched Action on Housing policy statement, the Government announced an additional investment programme, at an overall cost of £200 million, for non-national road schemes supporting residential and other developments. The road from Boden Park to Marley Estate running along the green route, is among the proposals which have been submitted by South Dublin County Council in response to a request from my Department to selected local authorities for suitable projects under this new programme.</P>
      <P>Proposals received from local authorities under this new investment programme are under consideration in my Department and an announcement concerning the projects which will be included in the programme will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department initiated discussions with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, with a view to the development of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to end-of-life vehicles, ELVs. It is intended that such an initiative would, in particular, take account of an EU Parliament and Council Directive on End-of-Life Vehicles. This directive entered into force on 21 October 2000, and member states must implement its requirements by April 2002.</P>
      <P>The directive incorporates a number of significant proposals, including measures aimed at ensuring that relevant economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs; ensuring that all ELVs collected are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution; preventing waste from vehicles; increasing the recovery and recycling rates of ELVs and their components; and minimising the use of hazardous materials/substances in vehicles.</P>
      <P>Initial proposals for an ELV management system for Ireland have been submitted by SIMI, and were circulated for consultation to relevant Departments and State agencies, and a number of representative associations and other bodies. On foot of the various submissions received, my Department will respond formally to the SIMI proposal this week. Further discussions will be sought with the society and other concerned parties, to progress the development of a practicable industry-led scheme. It is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Government remains strongly committed to improving Dublin and other taxi services for the benefit of all concerned. Every effort will be made to provide for an increase in Dublin taxi licence numbers as quickly as possible with due regard to the recent High Court determination.</P>
      <P>Greater increases in Dublin taxi licence numbers have already taken place within the term of this Government than under any other Government for over 20 years. While this increase of some 750 in the Dublin taxi fleet is welcome, the Government acknowledges, as evidenced by our initiative for a doubling of Dublin taxi numbers, that a much greater supply of taxis is needed to meet public demand.</P>
      <P>While the way forward has been complicated by the present judicial review, the direction and resolve of the Government's proposed reforms is not altered.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 370 and 374 of 24 October, planning authorities now have a maximum of nine months from com<Col N="954" /> mencement to prepare their housing strategies and start the procedures to vary their development plans. The strategies must be incorporated into the plans within a maximum of three further months. I have urged local authorities to complete the process well ahead of these time limits so that they can operate the social and affordable housing provisions as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for planning authorities on the preparation of their housing strategies are currently in drafting for publication this month along with a model housing strategy. The model strategy, which will demonstrate the practical operation of Part V using Louth as the model county, is being produced on the basis that there is a sufficient commonality of themes across planning authorities to make such a document both meaningful and useful. My Department will forward the guidelines and model housing strategy to each planning authority when completed and will be asking them to report to my Department by the end of January on the position in relation to the preparation of their housing strategies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Town Renewal Act, 2000, made detailed provision for the operation of the town renewal scheme and in particular provided that county councils would exercise an independent proactive role in the selection of towns and the selection of sites and the preparation of the town renewal plans themselves. It is appropriate that county councils who are in the best position to engage in the type of cross-sectoral consultation with relevant local interests which is required under the scheme, carry out this role.</P>
      <P>In doing so they were assisted by the detailed guidelines issued to them; these set out the purposes and aims of the schemes, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans are to be prepared, and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sites for designation. County councils were advised that the extent of designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Town renewal proposals prepared and submitted by Cork County Council were then subjected to detailed assessment by an expert advisory panel which I established. The member panel <Col N="955" /> comprises individuals with a broad range of relevant expertise in urban planning, architecture, conservation, etc. Two officials from my Department were members of the panel including the chairperson, who is my Department's principal planning adviser.</P>
    <P>The role of the expert advisory panel on town renewal set up by me was to assess the county council's proposals and recommend sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by the county council; the panel was confined to examining the sites recommended by the county council by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines.</P>
    <P>In the course of their examination of the plans, the panel sought clarification from county councils in relation to various issues where this was considered necessary. The expert advisory panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sites to be designated. The recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The sites selected for designation by the county council, examined by the expert panels and subsequently approved for designation, followed a very detailed, structured and well thought out process. Therefore, I do not consider that an appeals system is necessary, feasible or practicable; my priority now is to ensure that the town renewal scheme is implemented effectively to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 147 and 343 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has agreed to the introduction by the Revenue Commissioners of a levy on plastic shopping bags manufactured in Ireland, or imported, for use in the Irish market. This <Col N="958" /> measure requires primary legislation, and the Government further decided that the necessary legislative provision should be incorporated into the earliest available legislative vehicle. At this time, the next Finance Bill is likely to be the earliest suitable vehicle for this purpose, and the legislative provisions will be prepared in that context. It is the intention to implement the levy as early as possible in 2001.</P>
    <P>The supply side measure referred to above will be complemented by a mandatory point of sale charge to be made by retailers, to ensure that the impact of the levy is fully passed on to consumers. The enabling provision in this regard will be incorporated in regulations to be made under the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the proposed measures is to directly influence consumer behaviour and achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of plastic shopping bags dispensed at retail outlets, because of their significance as a highly visible component of litter. It follows, therefore, that revenue from the levy would be proportionate to the impact and success of the proposed measures and, for that reason, cannot reliably be estimated.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for decision by retailers whether and to what extent they are prepared to provide customers with alternatives to plastic shopping bags. It will of course be open to customers to utilise reusable bags or other containers for shopping purposes, and thereby avoid exposure to the proposed levy. I make a distinction between plastic shopping bags, and plastic bags used as primary packaging for products such as fertiliser. I have no proposals at this time to levy such primary packaging.</P>

      <P>In the context of the Government's anti-inflationary package senior officials of my Department met representatives of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute and the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers in July last. The message conveyed at those meetings was the importance for all professional and representative bodies to recognise the need for a sense of social responsibility and restraint in the setting of prices and fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both institutes appreciated the Government message that all interests should take positive steps to curb inflation. Both institutes pointed out that since the introduction of the Competition <Col N="959" /> Act, 1991, associations may not engage in anti-competitive practices including those which directly or indirectly fix prices or fees. The institutes also pointed out that there had been significant growth in the number of auctioneers in recent years and expressed their view that increased competition in the market has eliminated the scope for charging excessive fees. There is competition in the market for the professional services of auctioneers. People can avail of savings by exploring the various options open to them and I encourage them to do so.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 144 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term road rage encompasses a broad range of activity which is of itself aggressive in nature and can give rise to serious consequences in terms of legal infractions, injury and even death. Road rage generally encompasses intentional abusive, often violent, behaviour by the driver of a vehicle in response to a real or an imagined traffic grievance. In general terms, road rage and its consequences are more relevant to be addressed under general criminal legislation as opposed to road traffic legislation. The term &ldquo;road rage&rdquo;<Col N="960" /> originated in the United States and research carried out there suggests that the prevailing motoring environment can influence the incidence and severity of the behaviour which falls within the ambit of the term. Limited research carried out in the United Kingdom shows that the mood of a driver, allied with the driver's propensity to engage in unsafe driving, can be major influences in the creation of aggressive driving behaviour.</P>
    <P>Advancing road safety to positively influence driver behaviour is central to the Government's road safety strategy. The success of the strategy is critically dependent on public support from individual citizens. The strategy prioritises actions targeted at speeding, the use of alcohol, seat belt wearing and the vulnerable road user. The full mobilisation of all the recommendations set out in the strategy will have a positive influence on road behaviour which will in turn promote a greater degree of respect in each road user for their own safety and the safety of others.   </P>

      <P>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has been established jointly by the World Meteorological Organisation and the UN Environment Programme to make periodic assessments of the science, impacts and socio-economic aspects of climate change and of adaptation and mitigation options to address it and to provide advice to the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The IPCC is preparing its third assessment report which will summarise the state of knowledge covered in previous IPCC reports, but will primarily assess information generated since the Second Assessment Report, 1995.</P>
      <P>The IPCC has circulated to Governments the final draft of Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, prepared by working group I of the IPCC after peer review. Pending its final acceptance, and negotiation of a related summary for policymakers, the IPCC has asked that the draft text not be cited or quoted. However, I am satisfied that the IPCC will confirm the continuing need for urgent and sustained action across all policy areas to ensure that Kyoto targets are met and further reductions in green house gas emissions are made subsequently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 125 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. The comparative figure for 1996 was 27,427. Informed contacts with local authorities suggest that needs have increased over the last year by around 15%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the increased level of housing need, I have taken a range of measures to assist local authorities to expand their housing programmes and to expand overall social housing output. This has included the introduction of a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme for the period 2000 to 2003. I have also considerably expanded the voluntary housing programme. In addition, as part of the Government's Action on Housing the Government decided to increase the number of local authority housing units by an extra 1,000 units in each year from 2001 to 2006. I propose to notify local authorities shortly of the allocation of 3,000 of these extra units for the period covering the multi-<Col N="963" /> annual programme up to 2003. The four year multi-annual programme will, therefore, increase from 22,000 to 25,000 housing units. I have also encouraged local authorities to front load their programmes as much as possible to meet the increased level of need. In effect this allows local authorities to commence as many local authority housing projects as they can at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The total number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 1999 was 3,713 compared to 3,290 in 1998. I expect that completions, including acquisitions for the year 2000, will be in excess of last year's level. I estimate that the overall level of work in progress at the end of this year will amount to over 6,000 units either under construction or in the course of being acquired &ndash; by far the highest level of activity under the local authority housing programme for many years.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given to tackling this need. The local authority housing programme is, of course, only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met and I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, with the increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of over 10,000 households to be met this year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households. This level of social housing output will impact positively on the number of householders on waiting lists over the coming years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 132, 330 and 379 together.</P>
      <P>Government policy on child care is to increase the number of child care places available and to improve the quality of child care services for the community. I published draft guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities for public consultation in May of this year. The consultation period has now elapsed and the submissions received during the public consultation process are now being considered with a view to publishing finalised guidelines as soon as possible. The draft guidelines explicitly acknowledged that planning permission for child care facilities had been identified as an area of concern in relation to child care service development. The draft guidelines are intended to address this concern by ensuring a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for child care facilities and to identify to the planning issues appropriate to child care facilities.</P>
      <P>The guidelines will assist planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans and will also be of interest to developers, builders and child care service providers. The guidelines will also assist the planning authorities in fulfilling the requirement under the recently enacted Planning and Development Act, 2000, that the provision of services for the community, including crèches and other child care facilities must be included as an objective in development plans. This provision will apply from 1 January 2001. In view of the importance of the issue and the advanced state of the guidelines, when issuing the draft guidelines I asked planning authorities to take the draft guidelines on board immediately. The final guidelines will be issued as ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which has been commenced from 1 November 2000. Section 28 requires that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála shall have regard to those guidelines in the performance of their functions.</P>

      <P>Arising from the commitment made in the Government's Action on Housing to improve the deployment of existing planning resources, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, were made on 22 June 2000 with a view to freeing up resources in the planning system.</P>
      <P>The main effect of these regulations is to increase the size of domestic extensions exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, subject to compliance with specific conditions and limitations. The regulations specify different limits for different circumstances, for example, whether the dwelling house had been previously extended and whether it is detached, semi-detached or terraced. In addition, the regulations contain a number of conditions designed to ensure the changes in relation to exempted development extensions do not result in any injury to the amenities of adjoining properties.</P>
      <P>My Department has received correspondence in relation to the interpretation of these regulations suggesting that they are open to different interpretation. I am advised that the intent and purpose of the regulations are clear. I will avail of the opportunity offered by the comprehensive review of the exempted development regulations under way in my Department to review these specific provisions.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>No plans have been returned to my Department by Mayo County Council. The council debated the town renewal scheme at a recent meeting and a number of resolutions were passed in this regard. These included writing to my Department regarding the introduction of an appeals procedure, increasing the areas for designation in Ballinrobe and Claremorris and seeking approval for all areas of refurbishment as submitted in the original submission.</P>
      <P>Under the Town Renewal Act, 2000, it is a matter for the relevant county council to propose sites for designation for tax incentives within the area covered by the town renewal plans. This system has operated effectively since being introduced for the 1999 urban renewal scheme and it is appropriate that county councils, which are in the best position to engage in the type of cross-sectoral consultation with relevant local interests required under the scheme, perform this role. In doing so they are assisted by the detailed guidelines issued to them; these set out the purposes and aims of the schemes, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans are to be prepared, and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sites for designation. County councils were advised that the extent of designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
      <P>The role of the expert panels set up by me was to assess the county councils' proposals and recommend sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by the county councils; the panels were confined to examining the sites recommended by the county councils by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines. The panels comprised individuals with a broad range of relevant expertise in urban planning, architecture, conservation etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> In their examination of the plans, the panels sought clarification from county councils in relation to various issues where this was considered necessary. The panels exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sites to be designated. The recommendations made by the panels were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The sites selected for designation by the county councils, examined by the panels and subsequently approved for designation followed a very detailed, structured and well thought out process. Therefore, I do not consider that an appeals system is necessary, feasible or practicable; my priority now is to ensure these schemes are implemented effectively to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved.</P>
    <P>The town renewal schemes will run until 23 July 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The DTO policy document, A Platform for Change, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 2 October 2000, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area, GDA, in the period to 2016. This strategy document updates and builds substantially on progress achieved under the Dublin Transportation Initiative final report already approved by the Government in 1995.</P>
      <P>The revised DTO strategy takes account of fundamental changes in the economy in recent years which have led to increases in population, employment and economic activity which have resulted in traffic growth.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the transportation strategy proposed in response to changed circumstances are: a radical transformation in the quality and quantity of public transport services; strategic, but limited improvements to the road network; improved traffic management and control measures; development of a demand management policy to reduce the growth in travel while maintaining economic progress and to encourage modal shifts in favour of public transport; and better integration of land use and transportation planning.</P>
      <P>The strategy also offers some preliminary advice, based on Dublin Transportation Office &ndash; DTO &ndash; experience since 1995, regarding future institutional arrangements for strategic land use and transportation planning and co-ordination in the GDA.  Regard will be had to this by the Cabinet committee on infrastructure in its consideration of these issues which is due to be undertaken shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public transport elements of the strategy aim to cater for approximately 300,000 trips, 70,000 today, in the morning peak hours through an integrated public transport network comprising a much expanded bus network, comprising an integrated mesh of radial and orbital services and a substantial increase in passenger carrying capacity; an improved DART-suburban rail network, including improved passenger carrying <Col N="970" /> capacity on the existing network and the development of more tracks on existing alignments and new rail lines, including an underground interconnector linking Heuston Station with East Wall Junction <i>via</i> Pearse Street and docklands; an extension of the on-street light rail network, LUAS; the development of a higher capacity segregated light rail network, METRO; and a package of measures designed to improve the integration and attractiveness of the public transport network, including park and ride facilities, integrated fares and ticketing, quality interchange facilities and improved passenger information.</P>
    <P>The roads element of the strategy comprises: completion and upgrading of the orbital motorway, M50, Dublin port tunnel and eastern bypass; upgrading the arterial routes, for example, N1, N2, N3, N4, N7, N11, N81, outside the orbital motorway; upgrading of non-national roads necessary for access to M50, development needs in metropolitan area and development centres and support of public transport.</P>
    <P>The traffic management element of the DTO strategy provides for improved traffic signal control on a regional basis, enhanced cycle network and facilities, improved pedestrian facilities, further traffic calming schemes and improved management of heavy goods vehicle traffic.</P>
    <P>The strategy identifies traffic demand management as an essential complement to the infrastructure and service improvements proposed and provides for the early development of a demand management strategy addressing, <i>inter alia</i>, possible road user charging, workplace parking control, mobility management schemes, etc.</P>
    <P>The total estimated capital cost of the strategy is £14.2 billion and implementation is expected to: result in a high quality public transport service being available to most people within ten minutes walking distance of where they live; increase the share of the market accounted for by public transport from 35% to 65%; reduce congestion; improve accessibility; and result in significant environmental gains, including reductions in energy use and emissions below what they would be otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the comprehensive measures proposed in the strategy will contribute substantially to the alleviation of traffic congestion in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>Compensation is payable by local authorities for land acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed compulsory order. The amount of compensation is a matter for negotiation between the local authority and the property owners concerned and I have no function in the matter. In the event of agreement not being reached either party has recourse to the land reference committee for the appointment of an official property arbitrator to determine the appropriate compensation.</P>
      <P>The arbitration system operates under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental rule of importance which is contained in the 1919 Act and which must be applied by the arbitrators provides that the value of the land is the market value. Market value is assessed at the time of service of the notice to treat. The assessment of compensation also provides for sums for disturbance, severance and injurious affection as outlined in the compulsory <Col N="972" /> compensation code. As the existing compulsory acquisition compensation code provides for the payment of compensation at market value there are no plans to amend legislation in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 155 and 279 together.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been taken to increase the number of professional planners in the planning system. My Department has written to planning authorities on a number of occasions asking that they consider the adequacy of their professional-technical and administrative-clerical staffing to ensure the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. While my Department has approved requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional professional planner posts, I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts. However, an additional 64 planners were employed by the local authorities between March and July this year, but the number of vacancies stands at around 110.</P>
      <P>The current pay and conditions of all local authority staff, including planning staff, are governed by the terms of the public service pay agreement which is incorporated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. That agreement also provides for the pay and conditions of all staff to be reviewed by the benchmarking body set up under the agreement and sets down the basis on which the outcome of the benchmarking process is to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further measures have been taken to increase the capacity of the planning system and the num<Col N="973" /> ber of planners. Following the publication of Action on Housing in June this year I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 square metres to 40 square metres. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas, to allow planners to concentrate on more complex applications and forward planning issues.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the third level education sector with a view to identifying ways of producing more planners through the education system. As a result, from September this year new and expanded courses in University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology Bolton Street will treble the output of graduate planners in two years' time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum. Further additional courses are also under consideration.</P>
    <P>In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the possibility of employing planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being examined. In this regard, my Department is exploring with FÁS the potential to secure planners from abroad through the FÁS Jobs Ireland campaign. As well as jobs fairs in other EU member states and locations such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the campaign also involves the use of the FÁS Jobs Ireland website. My Department will also pursue with the local authorities and the Local Government Computer Services Board the use of information technology to streamline planning procedures.</P>

      <P>My main function in relation to travellers is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial framework within which local authorities, voluntary bodies and travellers may provide for or be assisted in the provision or management of accommodation for travellers. Local authorities are now in the process of implementing their local accommodation programmes as required under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998. The increased provision of accommodation resulting from the implementation of the programmes should diminish the incidence of unauthorised traveller encampments around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 32 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, provides local authorities with new and improved powers to deal with the incidents of unauthorised traveller encampments on public land and on the roadside. Briefly, section 32 empowers local authorities to act where an unauthorised temporary dwelling is within five miles of a serviced site provided by any housing authority or voluntary body with the assistance of a housing authority, an unauthorised temporary dwelling is in poor condition or interferes with amenities or is likely to be a risk to personal or public health or safety, an unauthorised temporary dwelling is within one mile of any traveller accommodation provided by the housing authority or approved voluntary body. The purpose of these provisions is to protect residents in traveller accommodation and those resident in the vicinity of that accommodation. Guidelines <Col N="975" /> have issued to local authorities in relation to these provisions.</P>
    <P>There are other powers available to local authorities such as those available under the planning Acts in relation to unauthorised development and under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, in relation to the prohibition of temporary dwellings in certain areas. Controls under environmental, litter, public health legislation and the legislation relating to the control of dogs and horses are also available to local authorities to deal with unacceptable behaviour which may arise from the use of temporary dwellings.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 276 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 347 and 348 of 17 October 2000. Following an evaluation by my Department, I recently gave approval to a <Col N="976" /> more detailed analysis by local authorities of 11 of the 25 sites put forward as strategic development zones for residential development under Part IX of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. These candidate sites have the potential to provide almost 41,000 housing units. One of the objectives of residential strategic development zones is to expedite the delivery of large-scale residential sites. In general, therefore, it is expected that strategic development zones for housing should be capable of being built within a maximum of five years.</P>
    <P>As part of the further analysis being undertaken by the local authorities concerned they have been asked to assess what structures need to be put in place to deliver necessary infrastructure to these sites in the event of their designation as strategic development zones. In this context, the local authorities were asked to have regard to the preferred approach set out in Action on Housing regarding the establishment of project offices to drive infrastructural development. It is my intention that the Government will be in a position to designate the first tranche of strategic development zones later this month.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote separately to key local authorities in August asking them to examine the operation and resourcing of existing project offices for water and sewerage schemes necessary for new housing development. The measures necessary to facilitate the expansion of existing offices or the creation of new offices will be considered by my Department in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 336 and 372 together.</P>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for the monitoring, management and protection of water quality is assigned primarily to local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency report, Ireland's Environment &ndash; A Millennium Report, identifies eutrophication, or over-enrichment, as the main water quality problem in Ireland. The report indicates that eutrophication of inland surface waters is widespread and that the most recent review indicated a continuing deterioration. Eutrophication is caused mainly by excess inputs of phosphorus from various sources and affects one third of the river system. For these reasons, the EPA considers that eutrophication of inland waters is perhaps Ireland's most serious environmental pollution problem. The EPA report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, integrated strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication. Major catchment-based projects for the establishment of water quality monitoring and management systems are well under way, or nearing completion, in relation to Lough Derg, Lough Ree and Lough Leane and the Boyne, Liffey and Suir rivers. This strategy is already beginning to show evidence of some improvements in water quality. The strategy is underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which I made in July last year. The regulations set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by end 2007.</P>
      <P>The strategy is being supported by my own Department's major investment programme in sewage infrastructure facilities throughout the country. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, provides for capital expenditure of some £3 billion the major portion of which will be devoted to wastewater infrastructure. The investment programme lays particular emphasis on the provision of phosphorus reduction facilities where a need is indicated in this regard. Discharges to waters from industrial sources are subject to licensing controls operated by local authorities and the EPA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While sewage and industry are significant contributors to the overall phosphorus load to freshwaters, agriculture is considered to be by far the largest contributor accounting for 73% of total inputs. Phosphorus losses from agriculture arise from inadequate waste management at farmyard level and from leaching and run-off from land, particularly following the land spreading of slurries or the use of chemical fertilisers containing phosphorus. In 1999 and 2000, by-laws were made by certain local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts to protect waters against pollution by agriculture. Further such by-laws are under consideration by several <Col N="981" /> other authorities. The making of such by-laws was facilitated by regulations made in 1998 by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to extend and strengthen the powers of local authorities in this regard. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has substantial initiatives under way to tackle phosphorus inputs from agriculture, including the rural environment protection scheme and the proposed new farm waste management scheme.</P>
    <P>A voluntary agreement has been concluded with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association, IDAPA, which provides for an incremental move to zero-phosphate domestic laundry detergents by IDAPA members. The agreement sets targets of 55% by end June 2000, 90% by end 2001 and 95% by end 2002.</P>
    <P>My Department is promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters, and all sources of water pollution. These projects will facilitate implementation of the recently adopted EU water framework directive which requires the achievement of good water status, as defined in the directive, generally within a 15 year timeframe, in a co-ordinated programme of measures by all relevant authorities in relation to the management of water quality and quantity. Financial support at a rate of up to 85% will be provided by my Department in relation to expenditure incurred by local authorities in relation to such projects.</P>
    <P>The most recent comprehensive report by the EPA in relation to water quality, 1995-97, indicates that nitrates in rivers are generally well within the limits, 11 mg/l nitrogen, set by EU legislation in relation to raw waters for treatment and supply as drinking water and that there was no widespread pollution of particular aquifers. The report identified localised instances of elevated levels of nitrates in certain groundwaters. The EPA has estimated that the loads of nitrogen entering water from agricultural activities far outweigh those from other sources, including waste water, and comprise some 82% of the total.</P>
    <P>Additional protection against pollution of waters by nitrates will be provided by action programmes to be developed in relation to those areas where the levels of nitrates in groundwaters are approaching or exceeding the limits set by European legislation. As I indicated in a public statement in July 2000, the affected waters are located in counties Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Louth and Waterford. Work is under way on the identification of the catchments related to these waters and, on their identification, I will formally designate the appropriate areas as &ldquo;nitrate vulnerable zones&rdquo;, NVZs. Designation of an area as an NVZ will place higher emphasis on the measures already in place in practice. The voluntary code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates, the blue book issued in 1996, will become mandatory in an NVZ. A primary consideration will be the management of <Col N="982" /> manures and slurries. I am keeping the position under review in relation to other groundwaters and surface waters which may need additional protection.</P>
    <P>Other form of water pollution, such as contamination by metals, synthetic organic chemicals and hydrocarbons, can damage or destroy aquatic life. While these forms of pollution are considered to be of minor significance in Ireland, reflecting the low level of heavy industry, I propose to make regulations in the near future to set water quality standards in relation to a number of substances, including certain pesticides, solvents and metals, in order to provide additional protection for waters and to give further effect to EU Directive 76/464/EEC, the &ldquo;dangerous substances Directive&rdquo;. I will take such additional measures as I consider appropriate from time to time to provide for adequate management and protection of water quality to combat water pollution from all sources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 310 together.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, envisages significant private sector investment in national road development: some £1 billion of the £4.4 billion provided for national road improvements in the NDP is to be contributed by public private partnership financing. In addition to the three pilot national roads projects already identified in the plan, the National Roads Authority has announced a further eight PPP schemes for the national road network. These new schemes, with the pilot projects, will involve total estimated investment of over £1,000 million, with a potential private finance input of some £700 million, based on user tolls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>User tolls are in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are particularly favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required. They are a considerably more widely used instrument of roads financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects. While the use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, road user tolling is, on the basis of the above considerations, more <Col N="983" /> likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</P>
    <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. The exercise of these powers has been subject to the approval of the Minister of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Following commencement of the relevant provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, ministerial approval will no longer be required for toll schemes, by-laws and agreements. In accordance with the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, these matters are being brought fully within the discretion of the National Roads Authority or the relevant local road authority, in the case of national and non-national roads respectively.</P>
    <P>In parallel, under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Roads Act, 1993, has been amended to provide for the issue of policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the exercise of their road tolling functions, with which they will be obliged to comply. Any such policy directives may not relate to particular tolling schemes and would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>My Department obtains regular returns from mortgage lending institutions in respect of the prices of houses for which mortgage loans are approved. My Department also obtains house loan survey data provided by individual house purchasers and collected by the mortgage lending agencies. Data from these returns are published in my Department's quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletins.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I appointed consultants to examine the current methodology for monitoring house prices, to recommend improvements and to establish a methodology for collating, analysing and producing house price information in the future.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's strategy on homelessness, which was published last May, provides for an integrated response to homelessness by all the agencies involved, both statutory and voluntary. As a key element of the strategy, local authorities and health boards are required to draw up local action plans, detailing how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved in these areas. This work is ongoing at present and I have urged local authorities to complete these plans as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I have made substantial additional funding available to local authorities to ensure that the measures in the strategy are implemented. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years and current funding is being increased by £6 million per annum to increase bednight contribution rates to voluntary bodies and other support services.</P>
      <P>Output in the voluntary housing sector will be increased to 4,000 units per year over the lifetime of the national development plan. It is expected that at least half of these units will be provided under the capital assistance scheme which is used extensively to provide special needs housing for certain groups, especially the homeless. In addition, the expanded local authority housing programme of 25,000 units over the four year period 2000-2003 will provide additional accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin area, where there is the greatest incidence of homelessness, the Dublin Homeless Services Agency is currently being established to co-ordinate the delivery of all services to homeless persons and Dublin Corporation have recently advertised for the post of director of the agency.</P>
      <P>I continue to encourage all local authorities either directly on their own or in association with voluntary bodies to develop and bring forward proposals for additional accommodation for homeless persons.</P>

      <P>Land owners and the public must be consulted on the construction of roads and motorways under the relevant statutory provisions of the planning Acts or the roads Act. In addition, earlier non-statutory consultations with these parties now commonly takes place in relation to major national road developments. Within the unavoidable land requirements of such developments, it is the policy of the National Roads Authority and road authorities to seek to minimise all adverse impacts, including severance of farms.</P>
      <P>Local authorities can acquire land for road building by agreement or compulsorily. Where lands are acquired by agreement the level of compensation and timing of the purchase are matters for the local authority and the land owner.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing compulsory land acquisition by local authorities provides for the payment of compensation for lands acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed CPO. The amount of compensation payable by local authorities in such cases is a matter for negotiation between the land owner and the local authority concerned, or, in the event of dispute, for arbitration. The basic rule applied by the property arbitrator under the relevant legislation is market value. There is also provision for compensation for disturbance, severance and injurious affection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that in principle it is desirable for <Col N="986" /> statutory procedures, including land acquisition, to be completed as quickly and efficiently as possible. In this regard, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, tightens the time limits for dealing with CPOs which should lead to earlier completion of procedures in this area. I am also aware that issues regarding acquisition of agricultural land for major road and motorway construction have been raised by the Irish Farmers Association with the NRA and that dialogue between these parties is continuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 304 together.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made on the mandate given by the Government to my Department to prepare a national spatial strategy which will translate the overall approach to regional development contained in the national development plan into a more detailed framework for spatial development in Ireland over the next 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of that mandate, my Department established a spatial planning unit to manage the preparation of the strategy. An interdepartmental steering committee, with representation from all relevant Departments, established to oversee the development of the strategy at policy level, has met on a number of occasions. The interdepartmental committee is supported by a technical working group and sub-groups to facilitate a co-ordinated input to the preparation of the strategy from Departments, State agencies, regional <Col N="990" /> assemblies and all other bodies whose policies, functions or operations are relevant to the achieving the objective of more balanced regional development. In addition, I have established an expert advisory group which provides a vehicle for my Department to avail of the advice of leading national and international figures in the area of spatial development and planning.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy is being prepared in four stages. The first stage of the process was completed in May 2000 with the publication of a report entitled, The National Spatial Strategy &ndash; Scope and Delivery. This report sets out the background to the strategy, identifies its objectives and the challenges it faces to achieves those objectives, gives details of the work to be carried out during each stage of the process of preparing the strategy, sets out the organisational structures which have been put in place and the arrangements which have been made for the participation of relevant interests and the public generally in the process. A copy of this report has been circulated to all members of the House.</P>
    <P>Stage two of the process of preparing the strategy, which will be completed shortly, required extensive research into the spatial structure and functioning of Ireland under a number of different headings. External consultants are assisting with a number of these research projects. This research includes in-depth analysis into such areas as population and labour force projections and future housing demand broken down on a regionalised basis, the future role of Dublin in Ireland and Europe, urban and rural functioning, enterprise development, quality of life issues, transport infrastructure, energy, educational access, environmental protection and availability of services.</P>

      <Col N="991" /> The research and analysis phase of preparing the strategy will be followed by the preparation of policy option papers which will be the subject of a broad-based consultative process to conclude by April of next year. The final stage during the latter half of next year will see the drawing together and reconciliation of the emerging strands of policy and drafting of the strategy itself, including the proposals for the future functioning of urban areas of different sizes, with a view to publication of the strategy by the end of 2001. I am determined that this target date will be met but given the complexity of the issues under consideration and the need for extensive consultation, it is not realistic to aim for earlier completion.</P>

      <P>It is the aim of Government housing policy to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment, and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. A number of measures and schemes are in place to facilitate households in the attainment of this goal.</P>
      <P>The nature of a household's housing circumstances and general living environment contribute to that household's quality of life. The quarterly national household survey conducted in the third quarter of 1998 by the Central Statistics Office contained a specific module on housing and accommodation. This module not only sought factual information from respondents regarding housing type, tenure, costs and physical characteristics but also sought information regarding levels of satisfaction with current accommodation and views of respondents on neighbourhood characteristics. I understand that the results of the housing module will be published by the CSO shortly. I also understand that the CSO intend to carry out similar surveys in the future and, this will facilitate assessment of changes in attitudes in relation to satisfaction with current accommodation and views on neighbourhood characteristics.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the National Economic and Social Council has been requested to consider the development of a framework to bring into operation national progress indicators to measure economic, social and environmental development. I understand that work is ongoing within the NESC on this.</P>

      <P>ISO 9000 is a general quality management system standard, which can be used by all industrial and service sectors. The International Standards Organisation &ndash; ISO &ndash; of which Ireland is a member, through the National Standards Authority of Ireland, and which is based in Geneva, publishes this standard, which is subsequently adopted in its member countries. The ISO 9000 standard is not intended to incorporate environmental quality standards, except where they affect the quality of products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> However, a separate ISO standard, ISO 14001 covers environmental management systems, and was published in 1996 under the title Environmental Management Systems specifications with guidelines for use. The ISO 14000 family of international standards offers a wide-ranging portfolio of standardised testing, sampling and analytic methods to deal with specific environmental challenges. It also offers a strategic approach by developing environmental management system standards, which can be implemented in any type of organisation, public or private. I would refer the Deputy to the website of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, www.nsai.ie for further detailed information on this standard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the current ISO 9000 standard, this standard has been recently revised and is expected to be published before the end of the year. NSAI has been represented in the revision of ISO 9000, and through a consultative committee process determined Ireland's input to the drafting of the revised standard.</P>

      <P>The report of the Donegal Employment Initiative envisaged that the setting of realistic job creation targets for foreign direct investment and the growth of the indigenous sector would be undertaken as part of the follow-up action through mechanisms such as the county development board. The county development board was established in March of this year and has undertaken a co-ordinating role with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, the development agencies which come under my remit, have reorganised their Donegal-based services to deal with actions arising from the report. IDA Ireland is actively seeking to increase the Objective One region's share of jobs in greenfield projects from 25%, at present, to 50%. Enterprise Ireland has recently articulated a clear regional development mission and will be devoting greater resources to boosting the indigenous sector and the potential for high growth firms.</P>
      <P>In February 2000, I announced details of a major investment package leading to the creation of 202 new jobs for Donegal. Most of these jobs are in the international trade services area. A key feature of the announcement is the number of expansions of longer established enterprises which are strengthening their capability through investment in technology, people, product development and market development.</P>

      <P>Consumer protection against misleading advertising exists on a statutory as well as on a non-statutory or self-regulatory basis. The statutory protection derives from the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which makes it an offence to publish any advertisement that is likely to mislead and thereby cause loss, <Col N="996" /> damage or injury to members of the public to a material degree. In addition, it is open to any person to apply to the High Court for an order to prohibit the publication of misleading advertising under the European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations, 1988.</P>
      <P>Non-statutory protection is assured by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, which is an independent self-regulatory body set up by the advertising industry to promote and uphold certain standards of advertising and sales promotion by their members. The association will investigate complaints made by individual members of the public. I am very supportive of all efforts by industry to adopt and adhere to standards of best practice on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>I understand that the report referred to by the Deputy concerns the findings made by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland in relation to an intra-industry complaint submitted to them for investigation by one of their members; and that the association has made certain recommendations to its members on foot of the investigation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent report by the UK Competition Commission on the supply of groceries from multiple stores in the UK. The recommendations cover a wide range of issues and I was particularly interested in their finding that the practice of persistent below cost selling by those with market power operated against the public interest in Britain. I took this finding into account in my recent decision to retain the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, which bans below cost selling. The UK Competition Commission report is a very extensive and detailed document and it will be of assistance in our ongoing monitoring of the Irish retail grocery sector.</P>
      <P>As to the value of conducting an inquiry in Ireland along the lines of that conducted by the UK Competition Commission, I have no plans to do so. The final report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group which I published in May of this year and a discussion document published by the group in December 1999 were significant contributions to the debate in this area. I therefore do not see any need for a further study along the lines of the UK Competition Commission report.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme &ndash; CE &ndash; is a labour market intervention measure targeted at the long-term unemployed. CE is a very popular programme and limited resources do not make it possible to provide places for all unemployed persons. Eligibility is confined to persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows/widowers pension for a minimum period of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain approval from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>On the above basis the person under reference is not eligible for CE. The present eligibility criteria for the programme were drawn up after a full review of CE was undertaken and in consultation with the social partners, and are designed to better target the programme at the most disadvantaged of society.</P>
      <P>FÁS, in the context of the current very favourable employment climate, provides a range of training courses aimed at people who wish to acquire new skills or up-date old skills and thereby return to the work force. Details of such training courses are available from the local employment services offices.

      <P>The Deputy will also be aware from my reply to Parliamentary Questions No. 112 and No. 114 of 17 October 2000 that the heads of the law of the sea (prevention of acts of piracy) Bill, 2000 were approved by the Government on 4 October and have been transmitted to the Attorney General's office for drafting in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. The target date for publication of this Bill in the Government legislation programme is mid-2001 at the latest. The objective of the proposed new legislation is to provide a framework in Irish law to deal with cases of harassment and intimidation at sea. The proposals, which are based on the piracy provisions of the aforementioned United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, involve the giving of powers of arrest to the naval authorities in circumstances where a vessel is suspected of having caused malicious damage to another vessel or gear. Such powers will, it is envisaged, apply both within the 12 mile territorial limit and on the high seas within the 200 mile limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis in endeavouring to deliver a quality aid programme is on achieving a balance, on using all of the channels available to assist the development of the targeted country. This requires that there be a focus, across all sectors, on building the capability of the under-developed country to develop itself. NGOs are one valuable means of doing this and particularly of delivering help to the poorest of the poor. However, what is important, too, especially for sustained and lasting development, are the partnerships between <Col N="999" /> donor and host Governments, which build the social, physical and governance infrastructure by which processes for ongoing development can be constructed and sustained. Also vital is the role of multilateral organisations on a range of issues, such as the enormous debt burden borne by developing countries.</P>
      <P>Our relationship with NGOs is deep and abiding and based on our respect for the outstanding reputation they have established in helping poor people. We provide a range of assistance to NGOs through the following channels: emergency humanitarian assistance; emergency preparedness and post-emergency rehabilitation assistance; the NGO co-financing scheme for development projects; the block grants scheme; the in-country micro projects scheme; and the democratisation and human rights programme.</P>
      <P>In 1999 NGOs received nearly £25 million from Ireland Aid, equivalent to 13% of total ODA of £181 million for the year. The percentage of Vote 39, the budget under my control, was higher, 15.36%. In 1999 GOAL received £1.4 million from the Irish programme in direct support and in aid channelled through it for specific humanitarian purposes. The OECD, in its examination in 1999 of the Irish programme commented that &ldquo;by DAC (the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD) standards, direct support to NGO activities and support through NGOs already absorbs a relatively large share of the Irish Government's aid spending . . . Many observers, including NGOs themselves, are sceptical about large increases in funding, as it is doubtful whether Irish NGOs could expand their programmes more than marginally, at least in the short-term, and maintain quality in their activities&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Algeria signed the Barcelona Declaration on 28 November 1995 and has been a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership since that time. The partnership covers three broad areas, namely political and security co-operation; economic and financial co-operation; and social, cultural and humanitarian co-operation. The overall objectives are the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights, sustainable and bal<Col N="1000" /> anced economic and social development, effective measures to combat poverty and the promotion of greater understanding between cultures.</P>
      <P>We have held continuing discussions with our EU partners concerning the human rights situation in Algeria, which is a major focus of our relationship with that country, and remains a serious cause of concern. As part of its dialogue, the EU has encouraged necessary reforms, modernisation and improvements in human rights, and has offered constructive assistance through the partnership. In this partnership dialogue, Ireland has sought to maintain a strong focus on human rights and the promotion of the role of civil society.</P>
      <P>We believe that Algeria's membership can make a valuable contribution towards the ending of civil conflict in that country. Each country in the partnership has made specific commitments under the declaration to act in accordance with the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The partnership also commits states to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. This is one of its fundamental pillars, and we are maintaining our call on Algeria to implement fully its human rights commitments.</P>

      <P>This Department operates a sick pay scheme which is designed to protect employees to a certain extent against loss of earnings which may occur if they are unavoidably absent from work due to illness. It is a requirement of the scheme that all claims for payment of social welfare disability benefit must be forwarded, in the first instance, to this Department for onward transmission to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>In the case under reference, the employee concerned has been absent on sick leave since 14 August 2000 and he was removed from the benefits of the sick pay scheme with effect from 13 September 2000 because of his repeated failure to comply with the above instructions, during the course of his present absence from duty.</P>
      <P>The employee concerned met with two officials of my Department on Friday, 25 October 2000, at which the question of restoring the benefits of the departmental sick pay scheme to him was discussed. At the meeting, the employee gave a verbal undertaking to comply in future with the terms of the departmental sick pay scheme. The officials from my Department agreed to review the matter, when the employee has clearly demonstrated that he is prepared to comply in future with the terms of the sick pay scheme and with the procedures for claiming sick pay entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that this is not the first occasion on which the employee concerned failed to comply with the instructions governing the submission of medical certificates. Following a pre<Col N="1004" /> vious period of absence on certified sick leave in the latter part of 1994, it was necessary for my Department to obtain a written undertaking from the employee that he would comply in future with the terms of the departmental sick pay scheme and with the procedures for claiming sick pay entitlement. The employee concerned furnished such an undertaking on 10 May 1995.</P>
    <P>Lastly, it is incorrect to state that the employee concerned was given holiday pay in error. The position is that the employee was due to take two weeks' annual leave from 28 August 2000 to 8 September 2000 and he received pay in advance for this period at his own request. He was allowed to retain this payment as he was entitled to full pay from my Department up to 12 September 2000 under the terms of the departmental sick pay scheme.</P>

For example, SIAL 2000 held recently in France, attracted buyers from 173 countries worldwide. Attendance by me or the Ministers of State at such key events lend support to the marketing efforts of Irish companies and further market access generally. Irish food exports now exceed £5 billion annually.</P>
      <P>The following is the information sought by the Deputy:</P>

      <P>Leader type activity in the period to 2006 will be delivered through the European Union Leader+ programme, together with a mainstream national rural development programme. A total of £117 million in public funding has been allocated to these two programmes, £58 million for Leader+ and £59 million in respect of the mainstream programme. The Government is providing some £20 million towards Leader+ and £35 million towards the mainstream programme. The balance of the funding is being provided by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Following a number of information seminars around the country in July this year, my Department invited notices of interest from rural development groups interested in participating in the new programmes. Subsequently, advertisements inviting interested groups to submit business plans for either or both programmes were placed in the national and provincial papers and farming press. By the closing date, 27 October 2000, a total of 85 applications was received. Forty of these applications were in respect of Leader+ with the balance relating to the mainstream programme.</P>
      <P>The process for selection of groups to operate the new programmes will commence shortly and will proceed contemporaneously with the Commission's consideration of the Leader+ Operational Programme. An independent consultant will be commissioned to examine and make recommendations on group selection. The Department will consider this assessment and report to Government who will make the final decisions on groups.</P>
      <P>Work on the preparation of the operational programme for Leader+ is at an advanced stage and it is expected that it will be lodged with the European Commission shortly. The programme will also be presented to the special North/South EU programmes body for its endorsement in tandem with the Northern Ireland Leader programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A period of five months is provided for to facilitate the Commission's consideration of the <Col N="1006" /> programme prior to deciding on approval. While I will be pushing for early approval of the programme, it is unlikely that approval will be forthcoming before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The national rural development programme forms part of the regional operational programmes and will be funded under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. Given their complementarity, the European Commission has indicated that the approval process for the national rural development programme and Leader+ will take place simultaneously.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-06 provides total indicative funding of £282 million for the food industry. The initiatives contained in the plan are market oriented and provide a cohesive and comprehensive response to the needs of the industry. The funding is allocated as follows: £120 million for capital investment; £83 million for research, technology and innovation; £48 million for marketing and promotion; and £31 million to address the human resources needs of the food industry.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements which have been drawn up for the implementation of the foregoing initiatives assistance towards the cost of setting up new or expanding existing agri-food manufacturing businesses, including those manufacturing products for supply to the hotel and catering industry, will be provided by the State industrial development agencies &ndash; Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. Responsibility for the promotion and market development initiative has been assigned to Bord Bia who will implement it through a wide variety of programmes including some which are targeted specifically at companies supplying or wishing to supply the food service sector.</P>

      <Quest>if the policy, actions and procedures taken by his Department to control BSE are in accordance with best practices as recommended by the International OIE body; when the report of the Irish BSE Scientific Advisory Committee was published; the actions taken following its publication; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has always complied with, and in some respects exceeds OIE requirements in relation to BSE. The OIE lays down criteria for the categorisation of countries for BSE purposes and the trading rules applicable to cattle, beef and bovine products. These criteria include minimum control measures to be adopted in order to be included in particular categories. On the basis of its incidence of BSE and the control measures it has adopted, Ireland is categorised by the OIE as a country or zone with a low incidence of BSE.</P>
      <P>The report of the Irish BSE scientific advisory committee was finalised during 1999 and published in February last. Since then a considerable amount of work has been undertaken to implement its recommendations, including those in relation to the further development of a control and recording system of all cattle movements, the presentation of an education programme on the clinical presentation of BSE and related conditions, the training of an epidemiologist, the reinforcement of the requirement for rigorous ante mortem examination of animals at meat plants and abattoirs, and the development of a system for monitoring and controlling the disposal of fallen animals, which will be finalised in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the committee's recommendation to cease burying BSE suspect animals, implementation of this recommendation involved having a ready alternative means for the disposal and ultimate destruction of the animals in question. The Deputy will be aware that the committee also recommended the development of incineration <Col N="1008" /> facilities for the disposal of such animals. There have been well publicised difficulties in advancing incineration facilities in this country.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, pending a resolution to the issue of disposal and ultimate destruction of BSE suspect animals, and for reasons which I have publicly explained, I have recently announced a decision to discontinue the practice of burying BSE animals in favour of holding them in cold storage. In the meantime, my Department continues to actively pursue a number of options which hold the prospect of resolving the substantive disposal-destruction issue. Such options will require the agreement of others, including the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

    <P>The purpose behind the first time buyer relief for the purchase of a house is to help individuals make the first entry into an already difficult housing market. Consequently, where a person has previously been able to purchase a house, either jointly or individually, one is not entitled to this relief. It follows that where such a person purchases a house jointly with a first time buyer, the relief cannot be claimed as the house is not being bought entirely by first time buyers. The point should also be made that where a previous house owner combines with a first time buyer to purchase a house, this would often confer a financial advantage over first time buyers, if the previous house owner was using the proceeds of a house sale.</P>
    <P>However, as table II above shows, owner-occupiers who are not first-time buyers also benefit generally from the revised stamp duty rates at the lower end of the market. In addition, there is no stamp duty on the sale of new residential property where the purchaser is an owner-occupier and the house is not greater than 125 square metres. If a new house in such cases is more than 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged on the site value only, subject to a minimum site value of one quarter of the full house value. I have no plans to introduce new provisions to the stamp duty legislation as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Mount Street crèche will be re-opened very shortly.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department has been working very closely with the co-operative which runs the crèche to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inspection by the Eastern Regional Health Authority revealed that the premises were below mandatory standards. The Office of Public Works has now almost finished the necessary refurbishment work. I understand from the co-operat<Col N="1012" /> ive that the private crèche management company which has been identified by the co-operative may need some time to install new equipment. Following that, the crèche will reopen.</P>
    <P>While I am very aware of the serious problems that closure of the crèche has caused parents, the most important task is to ensure that it reopens, with the proper facilities, as quickly as possible. Compensation would give rise to considerable administrative difficulties for the co-operative, which would probably divert attention from the work of refurbishing and reorganising the crèche.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which led to the closure of the crèche have been fully examined by the co-operative and my Department. A further investigation would not be useful.</P>
    <P>My Department is discussing with the co-operative a new longer-term management structure for Mount Street and for any other crèches which may be established. The aim is to put in place arrangements which will help to avoid the sort of difficulties which have arisen with the Mount Street crèche.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, applies to all employers, including the Civil Service. I assure the Deputy that the terms of the Act apply to all persons seeking employment and promotion in the civil service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure that all Departments and offices are aware of their responsibilities under the Act, the officials in my Department, in partnership with the Civil Service unions, are in the process of drafting a new equal opportunity policy for the Civil Service which will reflect the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The new Act extends the prohibition on discrimination in employment to nine grounds: gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious <Col N="1013" /> belief, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. Work on drafting the new policy is at an advanced stage and discussions with the staff unions should commence shortly.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions with the staff unions on a new gender equality policy are currently under way. The new gender equality policy sets out a new strategic approach to equality of opportunity and is supported by two documents which have been developed in order to assist Departments in implementing the new policy. These documents set out (i) guidelines on best practice in setting goals and an effective programme of affirmative action in the main human resources management policy areas of recruitment, placement and mobility, training and staff development, promotion, work and family issues and language and (ii) an outline of the structure of responsibility, accountability and monitoring for the delivery of gender equality within the civil service.</P>
    <P>The document, A Positive Working Environment, sets out the anti-harassment, sexual harassment and bullying policy for the Civil Service. The policy has been drawn up in consultation with the Civil Service staff unions and reflects those discussions, as well as developments in relation to harassment and sexual harassment arising from the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The policy has been issued to personnel branches in all Departments and offices and to all the civil service staff unions. A short leaflet summarising the policy has been issued to all civil servants. The responsibility for raising awareness and the detailed implementation of the policy lies with each individual Department or office. I understand that a number of Departments are in the process of developing awareness raising programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1999 introduced capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child care premises which meet the required standards as set out in the Child Care Act, 1991. In budget 2000, as part of a package of measures to address the provision of child care facilities, I announced that for expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 accelerated capital allowances at a rate of 100% would be allowable. This accelerated allowance is available to both owners of the child care facilities and also to investors who wish to invest by way of leasing arrangements. Section 63 of the Finance Act, 2000, amends section 843A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, so as to provide for these capital allowances. Following consultation with the EU Commission, on the issue of State aids, on 21 June 2000, I signed the necessary order bringing into effect section 63.</P>
      <P>The introduction in budget 1999 of capital allowances for buildings used for certain child care purposes was estimated at the time to cost of £1 million in a full year, while the provision of accelerated capital allowances in budget 2000 was estimated to cost £1.5 million in a full year. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that because the available statistics on tax relief for capital allowances do not distinguish between the amounts allowed for child care purposes and other purposes there is no basis on which a reliable estimate of the impact of these measures or of the numbers involved can be provided.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1999, also provided an exemption from a benefit in kind charge where employers provide free or subsidised child care for their employees. The exemption applies where the employer makes a premises available or, if a joint scheme, is involved in both the management and financing of the child care facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential cost to the Exchequer of exempting child care facilities provided by employers from the benefit in kind charge to income tax was estimated at the time of introduction of the relief to be of the order of £5 million <Col N="1016" /> in a full year. As taxpayers are not required to provide details of this benefit in their tax returns there is no basis on which to provide an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of the tax exemption or of the numbers involved.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of pre-budget submissions in relation to the scope of the BIK exemption in respect of certain child care facilities. The suggestions made will be borne in mind in the context of the preparations for the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, there are a number of tax reliefs for part-time education courses.</P>
      <P>Section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides relief from income tax at the standard rate of tax for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time third level courses in approved colleges. The relief applies to part-time undergraduate courses of a minimum duration of two years in publicly funded third level institutions and in private colleges. The relief also applies to a college or institution of another member state of the EU providing distance education in the State.</P>
      <P>Publicly funded institutions must have been approved by the Minister for Education and Science for the higher education grant scheme. In relation to private third level colleges, they must operate in accordance with codes of standards laid down by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Section 475A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief at the standard rate of tax for postgraduate tuition fees in publicly funded colleges here and in the EU as well as in private colleges in this country. The relief is available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students and includes distance education courses offered by publicly funded colleges in other member states of the EU.</P>
      <P>Approved courses must be of at least one year's duration and cannot exceed four years and they must lead to a postgraduate qualification award based on either a thesis or an examination. Individuals taking the courses must already have a primary degree or an equivalent qualification.</P>

      <P>The present health contribution was introduced by the Health Contributions Act, 1979. All individuals aged over 16 years were made liable to the levy on all of their income with minor exceptions. Current exemptions from the health contribution include social welfare payments, including social welfare pensions, maintenance payments and non-pecuniary income such as benefit-in-kind. Persons in receipt of a medical card are not liable to pay the health contribution. Other persons exempt from the health contribution include persons in receipt of social welfare widowed pensions, the deserted wife's benefit and the lone parent's allowance. The 1994 budget also introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levy below which there is no liability to the contribution. This threshold was substantially increased in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, and is currently £14,560 per annum, or £280 per week. All other <Col N="1018" /> income has always been liable to the levy, including income from occupational pensions.</P>
      <P>The health contribution was introduced for the provision of medical and hospital services. The total income from the health contribution is paid into the Vote for the Department of Health and Children as an appropriation-in-aid and thus is applied to meet part of the cost of the health services supported by the State.</P>
      <P>Although I have no plans to exempt occupational pensions from the health contribution, the threshold for the levy will be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy, to persons with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the relevant health board. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including speech and language therapists. Among the issues examined by this group were the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the workforce planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>
      <P>I am also very pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, I have secured a total of 52 extra places for the training of physiotherapists, five additional places for the training of occupational therapists and three in the area of speech and language therapy, all available from October 2000.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a &ldquo;fast-track&rdquo; physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. The first graduates from these programmes should be available in 2003.</P>
      <P>The possibility of establishing a similar course for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the 1996 report commissioned by Alone entitled Hospital Discharge of Older People. I understand that arrangements in relation to the discharge of older patients are in place in all acute hospitals. Notice of discharge varies from site to site with some discharges having to be arranged at short notice, for example, where there is pressure to admit patients through accident and emergency departments in some hospitals.  However, it is normal procedure that no older patient is discharged without prior assessment of his-her future needs being undertaken.</P>
      <P>In order to reduce pressure on the acute hospital sector and to provide care for older people in a more appropriate environment, additional funding has been provided since 1997 to enhance and improve services for older people in the non-acute sector. For example, since the publication by the former Eastern Health Board of its ten year action plan for services for older people 1999-2008 a number of service developments have been implemented including the provision of four hundred beds in community nursing units, in patient facilities and convalescent facilities; funding of approximately 300 additional contract beds; increased funding for nursing home subventions; provision of forty step-down beds attached to the acute general hospitals; creation of 140 day care places; appointment of two additional consultant physicians in medicine for older people, a range of measures to improve the care of older people in their home and in the community, including the appointment of community support teams and nutritional advisors; increasing the rates of pay for home helps, and provision of additional staff in voluntary care organisations including and establishment of carers groups.</P>
      <P>In addition, community nursing units are currently under construction at Maynooth and Lusk while a unit at Leopardstown Park Hospital is due to commence construction in the summer of 2001. Further units are at various stages of planning.</P>
      <P>As part of the winter initiative, I recently announced a £25 million investment package to alleviate pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter period.  This package includes the provision of at least 500 additional nursing home places across the country for patients who have completed the acute phase of treatment, many of whom are in the older age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently eight staff allocated to the mental health services division in my Department <Col N="1023" />&ndash; one principal officer, one assistant principal officer, two higher executive officers, two executive officers and two clerical officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Government came to office in 1997 it has invested approximately £60 million additional revenue funding in child care and family support services to help children at risk and to improve child protection and youth homelessness services. Services funded include the Doras out-reach project for those of all ages involved in prostitution in the South Eastern Health Board and the Youth Initiative Partnership to respond to the needs of children who are being sexually abused, including those who are involved in prostitution, in the North Eastern Health Board area. A number of health boards have carried out studies on child prostitution.</P>
      <P>The former Eastern Health Board established a working party on child prostitution which reported in 1997. The Mid-Western Health Board published a report entitled &ldquo;Prostitution in the Mid-Western Health Board Region&rdquo; in 1998.</P>
      <P>Child prostitution is primarily a child protection issue and all health boards are conscious of the need to target services at children who are at risk of becoming involved in prostitution.</P>
      <P>A very significant finding from the survey carried out by the working party on child prostitution in the Eastern Health Board area, which included Dublin, was that of the 47 young people aged under 18 and the ten young people aged 18 or over who were, or who had been, engaged in prostitution 80% had, or were, experiencing homelessness.</P>
      <P>It is of particular note in this regard that that the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which is the statutory body with responsibility for health and social services for people who live in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, has identified young people who are out of home as one of the key issues it has to tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the area boards in the eastern region have made significant progress in implementing the comprehensive package of child care and youth homeless service developments agreed with the Minister of Health and Children last July. This package includes the establishment of a provider forum on youth homelessness which brings together key service providers in the youth homelessness field; <Col N="1024" /> the appointment of a director of homelessness to the authority who will be working with the provider forum to develop a plan to address urgently the needs of young people in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way; the recruitment of a significant number of additional project workers, family support workers and out-reach workers; the review by each area board of existing facilities and the sourcing of properties to provide additional hostel-residential care accommodation; and the appointment of an additional assistant chief executive officer to each area health board to lead the development process.</P>
    <P>The authority has pointed out that a range of services are provided in the eastern region, such as the women's health project which provides targeted services, such as out-reach services, for those at risk of sexual exploitation. I might add that work on the national youth homeless strategy is progressing and I hope to launch it later this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of young asylum seekers being vulnerable to sexual exploitation, health boards outside the eastern region have not identified this as an issue. The Eastern Regional Health Authority acknowledge that unaccompanied minors seeking asylum may be vulnerable with regard to sexual exploitation. Arrangements are in place for a social work service to work with unaccompanied minors in the eastern region.</P>

    <P>*Includes eight places in the new special care unit in Ballydowd which is being opened on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>In addition, a number of special arrangements have been made available by health boards for individual children and this will continue to be a <Col N="1025" /> feature of the boards' responses to the needs of troubled children.</P>
    <P>Plans are under way to develop an additional 74 places nationally as follows. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the balance of the 16 places in the Ballydowd special care unit will be opened over the next few months; also the construction of a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane has commenced. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001. The Midland Heath Board, the North Eastern Heath Board, the North Western Heath Board and the Western Heath Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus.</P>
    <P>Places being developed in the other boards are as follows. Ten high support places and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Heath Board. Five high support places for boys in the Southern Heath Board. These places are due to become available by the end of 2001. In addition, two high support places will be opened on a phased basis in the North Eastern Health Board over the next few months.</P>
    <P>As mentioned above, special arrangements for individual children will continue to be provided and this will bring the total number of places available to about 160.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 approximately £13 million ongoing revenue funding has been made available to the health boards for the development of the high support and special care service which includes the provision of special arrangements for individual children.</P>
    <P>The total capital cost of the development programme is in the region of £30 million.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced earlier this year the establishment of the interim body on special residential services for children convicted of committing offences and children who have behavioural problems and are in need of special care and protection. This body provides advice to the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science on co-ordinating the delivery of services and on the development and provision of educational and other programmes in health board special care facilities and in those facilities run by, or under the aegis of, the Department of Education and Science for offending children. The special residential services board provided for in Part 11 of the Children Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House, will take over the interim body's responsibilities when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains a number of important measures for non-offending children who are in need of special care or protection. These include Part 3 of the Bill which empowers health boards to apply to the courts for special care orders to detain non-offending children in need of special care or protection and Part 2 which introduces the family welfare conference on a statutory basis for the first time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that funding of £1.2 million has been made available to date to support the development and introduction of the accreditation programme in the major academic teaching hospitals, MATH's. The accreditation programme will formalise standard setting and measurement across many aspects of a hospitals operations. The focus of the standards will be on the patient as he/she moves through an episode of care in the hospital. Standards will be developed around six interrelated functional areas applicable to each participating hospital &ndash; patient service groupings; leadership; information management; environment management; human resource management; and partnership.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the steering group which is developing the accreditation programme has informed me in recent days that development work on the standards and other aspects of the scheme is on schedule and will be completed by the last quarter of this year. The standards against which hospitals will be surveyed were successfully piloted across participating sites during the summer. Work in relation to the formal establishment of the Irish accrediting agency is at an advanced stage. The target date for the first formal survey is the final quarter of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A notable feature of the accreditation programme, which I very much welcome, is the <Col N="1027" /> relationship which has been established between the MATH's group and the Independent Hospital Association of Ireland, IHAI, as the representative body for private hospitals in Ireland. The IHAI and the MATH's group began to develop Irish accreditation schemes at different times and from different standpoints. However, they are now actively pursuing measures to bring about convergence of their respective endeavours. In this regard I was pleased to learn that the IHAI has formally agreed to work with the MATH's group on the establishment of a single accrediting body for the Irish health sector. While I understand that the convergence being aimed at may take some time to achieve it is my strong view that the interests of Irish patients and health care providers must be best served in the long-term by working to an agreed set of standards in Irish health care. I am confident that we will achieve this objective.</P>

Additional funding will be made available through the Supplementary Estimate for excess expenditure in the areas like demand-led schemes, superannuation, PRSI and medical indemnity. Allowing for these adjustments the health boards and voluntary hospitals are working to a break-even position at year end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that with effect from 1 July 1999 the drug payments scheme has been introduced. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his/her dependants will have to pay no more than £42 in any calendar month for <Col N="1029" /> approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>

      <Quest>if, when treatment is actually provided after a delay of several years, there is any mechanism whereby the statutory hospital in-patient waiting charges can be waived in a case where a person has medical card eligibility at the time of placement on a waiting list for in-patient hospital treatment but is not covered by a medical card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25214/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no statutory hospital in-patient waiting charges. Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means, and there are two categories of eligibility. Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of public health services free of charge. Persons in category 2 &ndash; non-medical card holders &ndash; have limited eligibility for health services, including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1, medical card holders, are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants' services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants' services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is £26 per night, up to a maximum of £260 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of £25 where the patient does not have a referral note from his/her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care. A maternity and infant care service is <Col N="1030" /> provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
    <P>The charges referred to above are applied when the services required are accessed. However, the Deputy may wish to note that health boards have discretion to waive public hospital charges in cases of hardship. Application for the waiver of such fees should be made to the local health board.</P>

      <P>The provision of services at St Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board document Shaping the Future of the Kilkenny Hospital System is the blueprint for the development of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, as a comprehensive, integrated, quality and efficient hospital, capable of meeting the challenges of the times in a competent and humane manner. The target date set for rationalisation of all hospital services in Kilkenny city into an interactive hospital complex is 2002.</P>
      <P>This development plan contains proposals to enhance existing services on the St. Luke's site including general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics, gynaecology, accident and emergency and diagnostic services. It proposes to provide all hospital services on one site in a way that combines ease of access to the public with a cost effective service. The development plans take account of national policy which is to have a strong network of local and general hospitals which serve defined catchment hospital services for general medical and surgical facilities.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of these developments the hospital has a limited capacity to respond internally to the increase in demands presented due to its physical design and structure and lack of access to alternatives to inpatient services.</P>
      <P>The following measures are proposed to be implemented with a view to redressing the difficulties experienced in the hospital: development of a four bed medical assessment/observation unit; redesignation of bed allocation between specialities in the hospital &ndash; medical, surgical and gynaecology including the redesignation of four gynaecological beds as surgical beds; provision of enhanced community supports including home help, home care and direct access to convalescent care in private nursing homes to facilitate early discharge; and development of the role of the bed management group at consultant level to review on a scheduled basis the impact of these measures.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> I trust the Deputy will understand why the board has had to take a range of measures to meet the exigencies of the current situation and in the interests of the future development of the hospital.</P>

      <P>The provision of services is the responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. The board received funding of £697,000 under the waiting list initiative in 1998 which represented an increase of 44% on the funding approved by the previous Government in 1997. In 1999 a total of £1,351,000 was provided to the South Eastern Health Board under the waiting list initiative. In 2000 £1,975,000 was provided to the board under the waiting list initiative. This has enabled the board, <i>inter alia</i>, to carry out an additional 287 hip and knee replacements up to 30 June this year. The board's waiting list returns for the quarter ended 30 June 2000 indicate that the numbers waiting for these orthopaedic procedures has dropped by 34% since the start of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards earlier this year, I announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable <Col N="1032" /> additional waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This brings the dedicated funding to waiting list procedures to £34 million this year.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>From the details supplied this question relates to contracted general practitioners under the GMS scheme. As per the contract, a contracted general practitioner is required to be routinely available for consultation for a total of 40 hours per week Subject to the agreement with the health board, the doctor concerned enjoys considerable scope in choosing the hours of his-her scheduled surgeries. The contracted doctor is also required to make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with him-her or a locum/deputy outside normal hours for urgent cases. GMS scheme doctors are free to make their own rota/locum arrangements. Rotas are usually organised by individual contracted general practitioners on a local and mutually agreed basis between colleagues.</P>
      <P>In order to further develop the best possible general practitioner service and to assist general practitioners in planning out of hours arrangements my Department is committed to developing structured out of hours general practitioner co-operatives which are already being piloted in the SEHB and NEHB areas.</P>

Orth. qualifications to fill the existing vacancies in the regional orthodontic unit at St James's Hospital; recruitment of three additional clinicians with M. Orth. qualification for the unit at St James's; recruitment of 12 nursing and nine administrative support staff for the additional clinicians as outlined above; the commissioning of five additional surgeries at St James's Hospital which will come on stream early in 2001; new regional orthodontic units are also being established at Beaumont and Loughlinstown. The unit at Loughlinstown is expected to be operational early in January next; existing waiting lists will be validated.</P>
      <P>The authority is also pressing ahead with organisational changes in the orthodontic services. Orthodontics will be managed and operated in the region on the basis of three services, one in each area health board.</P>
      <P>The combination of these developments should result in reduced waiting time and waiting lists for orthodontic services in the eastern region.</P>

      <P>I regard it as unacceptable for anyone to be forced to sleep rough in city streets or elsewhere. I, and the Government, would wish to secure greater progress in dealing with the problem of homelessness and it was essentially for this reason that I recently launched the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness. The strategy offers a new approach to the way in which services for the homeless are to be planned, funded and provided. As part of the Government's strategy on homelessness a homeless forum is being established at each city and county level and three year action plans are being drawn up to meet the needs of homeless persons in their areas.</P>
      <P>These three year action plans are now being drawn up by each homeless forum and will detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved in providing these services. As part of the development of these plans, I have asked that all existing services for the homeless be examined with a view to identifying any service gaps or deficiencies which exist, together with appropriate responses to deal with these gaps or deficiencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government's strategy on homelessness provides for capital spending on the direct provision by local authorities of suitable accommodation for homeless persons to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years. Additional current funding of £6 million per annum will also be available from my Department to increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation and to establish settlement/outreach services. Additional funding of £6 million will be available from the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care and specialist support for homeless persons in hostels.</P>
      <P>Details of the current level of homelessness in Dublin are not available to my Department. However, Dublin Corporation is in the process of finalising its action plan and when published this should give an indication of the level of homelessness and services needed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 240, 246, 252 and 301 together.</P>
      <P>The 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, recommended that local authorities identify and assess a range of waste treatment technologies, with a view to the development of an integrated waste management infrastructure appropriate to their particular circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thermal treatment of waste, carried on in accordance with high environmental standards, is <Col N="1038" /> regarded as environmentally preferable to the disposal of waste by landfill, and plays a major part in municipal waste management in many EU countries, and further afield. Accordingly, Changing our Ways proposed that, where technically and economically feasible, and subject to appropriate attention to materials recycling, incineration with energy recovery or other advanced thermal processes are among the treatment options which should be considered in an integrated waste management strategy. That remains the case.</P>
    <P>Thirty-four local authorities are required to make waste management plans under the Waste Management Act, 1996. Of these, 31 authorities engaged in making either regional waste management plans, or individual waste management plans that reflected a common strategic approach.</P>
    <P>To date, 28 authorities have adopted waste management plans either on individual or regional basis under the 1996 Act, four authorities &ndash; Galway Corporation and Galway, Laois and Louth County Councils &ndash; have rejected the relevant regional plan, while two authorities &ndash; Cork Corporation and Longford County Council &ndash; have yet to formally consider relevant plans. A total of 23 authorities, in six regional groups, have adopted waste management plans which provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for thermal treatment of waste.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the remaining local authorities complete the current strategic planning process as soon as possible. Accordingly, I am considering the possible use of a number of powers that are available to me under the Waste Management Act, 1996, with a view to expediting the completion of this process, and I am taking legal advice in this regard.</P>
    <P>The development of a national waste management plan or the establishment of a national waste management authority are possible options which might be considered in any medium to long-term review of our approach to waste management. However, I do not consider that they offer any prospect of short-term advantage.</P>

      <P>The results of the assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 revealed that single person households, including middle aged persons, account for 29% of the net need for local authority housing. <Col N="1039" /> Local authorities are required under section 20 of the Housing Act, 1988, when providing houses, to have regard to their latest assessment of needs and any needs subsequently identified and to seek to maintain a reasonable balance between the needs of the different categories of persons identified. Local authorities were again advised, in new social housing design guidelines issued last September, of the need to provide a mix of dwellings based primarily on the results of their most recent assessment of housing needs and the characteristics of households to be accommodated in their housing schemes. They were also advised that regard should be had to current best estimates regarding the size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future and of the need to ensure that a reasonable mix of dwelling types and sizes is maintained, both in the immediate locality and in the housing stock as a whole.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the present arbitration procedures are fair and equitable.

    <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for the transfer of the Minister's functions to An Bord Pleanála and brings about other <Col N="1042" /> changes designed to streamline the compulsory purchase order process. These include provision for less formal oral hearings in place of the more formal public local inquiries, the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders by local authorities themselves where there are no objections, time limits on submitting compulsory purchase orders to the board for confirmation, an 18 week objective for making decisions on compulsory purchase orders and shortening the period within which local authorities must serve notice to treat to purchase the land from three years to 18 months.

When deciding on planning applications a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities.</P>
      <P>The planning guidelines on residential density published by my Department in September 1999 indicate that public open space is one of the key elements in defining the quality of the residential environment. The guidelines recommend that the achievement of higher densities must be coupled with a higher standard of residential environment and thus the provision of higher quality communal and public open spaces is of paramount importance. The guidelines recommend that any acceptance of lower quantitative standards of open space must be accompanied by a parallel increase in qualitative standards of open space. The guidelines recommend in respect of higher density developments, that in greenfield sites public open space should be a minimum of 15% of the total site area, and in all other cases it should be a minimum of 10%. Planning authorities have been asked to review and vary their development plans to give full effect to the recommendations and policies contained in the guidelines, where they have not already done so.</P>
      <P>The social housing design guidelines published by my Department in September 1999 contain recommendations regarding open space within social housing schemes. They recommend that regard should be had by local authorities to the size of the scheme, the nature of the accommodation being provided, existing open space provision in the area and the requirements of the development plan for the area in deciding on the extent and nature of provision for public open space within a scheme.</P>

      <P>While my Department does not have a specific environmental economics unit, it draws on expertise in environmental economics as required in the policy development and evaluation process. Such expertise is drawn on through mechanisms such as research work commissioned from the Econ<Col N="1048" /> omic and Social Research Institute, work commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency as part of its overall research programme on environment and sustainable development, and individual consultancies where necessary. In addition, the National Climate Change Strategy provides for the establishment of a cross-departmental climate change team to secure early implementation of measures in the strategy; the team will be assisted by a support unit, which will include economics expertise to underpin the analysis necessary for implementation of specific measures.</P>
      <P>As far as the national spatial strategy is concerned, the preparation of this strategy is being overseen by an interdepartmental steering committee, representative of all the Government Departments who will have a role to play in the implementation of the strategy. It would be a matter for this committee to ensure that relevant environmental and economic issues are taken into consideration in the preparation of the strategy.</P>

      <P>In relation to the operation of emissions trading within the EU, the European Commission has published a Green Paper on Emissions Trading for consultation purposes which envisages,<i> inter alia, </i>the operation of a pilot emissions trading system from 2005. The Government is committed to active participation in the development and implementation of this system. In light of decisions at international level, and the experienced gained by the EU in any pilot scheme, necessary decisions will be taken at national level and legislative underpinning put in place for domestic and international emissions trading.</P>

      <P>A fee in respect of submissions on planning applications is provided for in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The Act for the first time places a statutory obligation on planning authorities to consider submissions on planning applications made by the general public. The Act also provides the planning regulations may provide that persons who made submissions are informed of the decision as of right by the planning authority and intend making such a regulation. The fee is designed to contribute toward the increased administrative burden placed on planning authorities by the Act in respect of persons who make submissions.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to submit draft planning fees regulations, which will include the fee for making a submission on planning applications, to the Oireachtas for positive resolution early in 2001. I have stated on a number of occasions in the Oireachtas that, when making these regulations, I do not intend to set this charge at such a level as to deter any person or body who has genuine concerns in relation to a planning application.</P>

      <P>Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, which was adopted by Government in 1997, provides the framework for national policy in relation to sustainable development. In its multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral approach, the strategy sets out a broad agenda for action in relation to environment policy and the integration of environmental considerations into sectoral economic policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide range of policy initiatives have been developed since 1997 in accordance with the principles and priorities established in the strategy. These include: a policy statement on waste man<Col N="1050" /> agement, Changing Our Ways (1998), planned investment in waste infrastructure under the national development plan, and development of producer responsibility initiatives in respect of particular waste streams; the recently-published National Climate Change Strategy (2000), which establishes a policy framework for adjustment of sectoral economic policies to combat adverse climate change; initiatives to protect urban air quality such as the elimination of leaded petrol, extension of the bituminous coal ban and plans for significantly increased investment in public transport under the NDP; actions to address eutrophication of rivers and lakes, including greater investment in water services, extension of water catchment management strategies, and promotion of nutrient management planning; and the putting in place of institutions and mechanisms to promote sustainable development such as the establishment of Comhar &ndash; the national sustainable development partnership, work on the development of environmental and sustainability indicators, initiation of a national environmental awareness campaign, the work of the environmental network of Government Departments, and progress with local agenda 21.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-06 (NDP), with the community support framework and the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, form the strategic policy context for the improvement of the national road infrastructure over the next seven years. In accordance with the Roads Act, 1993, it is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, within this framework to promote the detailed programming of the work required by the NDP and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, and the private sector in the context of public-private partnerships, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major national road investment projects traditionally have had long lead-in times and the level of activity represented by the national development plan will require considerable acceleration of the road planning and design process. <Col N="1053" /> Progress is already being made in bringing major road projects to construction in the fastest possible time.</P>
    <P>Efforts are being made through better and earlier public consultation and through comprehensive environmental impact assessments to reduce the potential for objections to projects. Furthermore, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, streamlines certain statutory approval processes and the timing and nature of judicial appeals. Under the Act, when commenced, ministerial decisions on motorway schemes, compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact statements are being transferred to An Bord Pleanála which must decide on these matters within 18 weeks of the closing date for receipt of submissions. The requirements for Ministerial approval of tolling schemes and associated by-laws are also being removed.</P>
    <P>A code of practice in relation to protection of archaeological heritage has recently been agreed between the NRA and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In addition, a broad-ranging package of measures is being pursued by the NRA. The Cabinet committee on infrastructural development provides high level oversight and assistance in relation to delivery of the NDP.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 347 together.</P>
      <P>My Department and An Bord Pleanála have been discussing on an ongoing basis a range of measures to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously in the context of the continued escalation in the number of appeals being received and the functions that will be transferred to the board in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Both the Department and the board regularly review the staffing position of An Bord Pleanála to ensure that all necessary resources are made available to the board. In this regard, in July of this year I approved an increase of 29 additional staff, nine professional planners and 20 administrative staff, which brings An Bord Pleanála's authorised staff complement to 134, excluding board members. I expect that these additional staff will assist the board in reducing the time it takes to decide appeals. In consultation with the board, I will continue to keep the situation under review in light of the trend in the volume of appeals and the board's performance. I have no proposals on hand at present from the board for additional staff. I have not, to date, received any request from the board for approval for an additional 35 planners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest statistics, year to end October 2000, from An Bord Pleanála show that 48% of cases, that is, 2,112 cases, were decided within the four month objective as set down in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992. The average time taken to decide cases was 20.7 weeks. A total of 2,287 cases were not decided within the four month objective. The delay in deciding cases has been decidedly affected by the ongoing increase in the intake of cases. To date <Col N="1055" /> in 2000 the intake of cases is 14% higher than in 1999. Given the pressures on the housing market and the Government's policy objective to increase housing supply, the board now accords priority status to housing developments in excess of 30 units. In the year to end October 2000 the percentage of such cases decided within the statutory period is 62.2% with the average time taken to decide these cases 17.3 weeks.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the duty and objective of the board to decide appeals as quickly as possible was considered as part of the review of planning legislation which has resulted in the recent enactment of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Under the new Act, it will be the objective of the board to ensure that every appeal is decided within 18 weeks, beginning on the date of receipt of the appeal. I have the power under the Act to vary this period either generally or in respect of a particular class of appeal or referral. The Act lays down that I may do this in the case of a development which is considered to be of special strategic, economic or social importance to the State. While I will keep the period under review, I have no plans to change it in the near future.</P>

      <P>The arrangements under which water services projects are procured are reviewed regularly by my Department with the objective of minimising the need for direct departmental involvement and increasing the responsibilities of local authorities in the procurement process, so as to accelerate progress of projects generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant additional functions devolved to local authorities since 1999 include: in the case of projects costing between £0.5 million and £1 million, once the preliminary report for a project has been approved and the project is included in the water services investment programme as a scheme to go to construction, the project may proceed to construction without need for further departmental approval. Where a project has been included in the investment programme to be advanced through planning only, the project may proceed to completion of contract documents without need for further departmental approval. In the case of projects costing more than £1 million, once the Department has given approval to a stage of a project, for example, preparation of a preliminary report, contract documents or tender documents, further approval will not be necessary for matters such as the appointment of consult<Col N="1056" /> ants, the carrying out of investigation contracts or legal and other eligible non-contract expenditure, providing these elements have been clearly identified by the local authority in its submission seeking approval to proceed to the next phase.</P>
    <P>Management of all small public water services projects costing less than £250,000 has traditionally been devolved to local authorities. This limit was raised to £500,000 earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The increasing role of public-private partnerships, using private sector skills and management expertise will also provide a mechanism for accelerating capital projects. Considerable work has been undertaken to actively promote and develop the PPP model and significant progress has already been made in some forms of PPP in water services. Approximately 100 projects in the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 have been identified as having PPP potential.</P>
    <P>The process for reviewing procedures is continuing on an ongoing basis with a view to identifying further potential devolution measures that will ensure that the water services projects provided for under the national development plan are delivered in a timely and cost efficient manner.</P>

      <P>Part B (fire safety) of the Building Regulations, 1997, sets out requirements in relation to fire safety in the <Col N="1057" /> design and construction of new buildings and the extension, material alteration or change of use of existing buildings. These requirements cover an extensive range of fire safety measures including the provision of smoke alarms in domestic dwellings and, where appropriate, more extensive fire detection and alarm systems in other building types.</P>
      <P>I issued technical guidance document B in December 1997 to provide guidance on complying with the requirements of the building regulations. It provides extensive guidance on the provision of smoke alarms in dwelling houses and fire detection and alarm systems in other building types. The nature and extent of the provisions required depend primarily on the size and occupancy use of the buildings concerned, including use as residential homes and places of employment.  </P>
      <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, places a general duty of care in relation to fire safety on persons in control of buildings to which the Act applies, excluding private dwelling houses. This duty extends to the provision of appropriate fire safety measures including fire detection and alarm systems in the buildings concerned where these are appropriate, irrespective of when the buildings were originally constructed. My Department has published a series of fire safety guidance documents for different occupancy types, hotels and guesthouses, flats, nursing homes, hostels, pre-schools, etc., to assist persons in complying with this statutory requirement.</P>
      <P>Fire safety in the home is the responsibility of the individual householder. Better awareness of the dangers of fire and of fire hazards, with simple common sense fire prevention practices and the installation of smoke alarms, can help to prevent and reduce the number of fires and the consequent tragic fatalities and injuries. Accordingly, the National Safety Council actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns. Particular emphasis has been placed in recent media campaigns on the routine tasks to be carried out nightly to guard against fire and on the value of smoke alarms which, if properly installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire and save lives. In addition, local authorities have been asked by my Department to consider the provision of smoke alarms in all their rented dwellings.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to introduce further legislation.</P>

I am satisfied that current Government policy in respect of charges for water services complies with the requirements of the directive. This policy requires local authorities to recover the costs of providing water services to non-domestic users from those users. The costs of the provision of water services to domestic users will continue to be met from public funds. Use for purposes incidental to a dwelling house where water is not drawn from a tap inside the house is excluded from the legal definition of domestic use as is supply of water to an apparatus depending while in use upon a supply of continuously running water. I shall be reviewing this definition in the context of a water services Bill at present under preparation.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Government policy on the application of the polluter pays principle to water services, local authorities are required to recover from non-domestic users, including the commercial sector, the operational and marginal capital costs of providing such users with water and waste water services. Identification and recovery of marginal capital costs by local authorities is now a criterion for the approval of any scheme under my Department's water services investment programme. In relation to operational costs, local authorities must complete the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006 and recover the operational costs of providing water services to those users by means of a volumetric water supply charge. Pending the completion of the metering programme costs can be recovered on the basis of a flat rate charge. These arrangements are to be applied uniformly by all local authorities and there is no provision for the exemption of any business, or other non-domestic, user from the charges. The costs of the <Col N="1060" /> provision of water services to domestic users will continue to be met from public funds.</P>

      <P>The relationship between house prices and gross average industrial wages does not provide a reliable guide to trends in housing affordability, as it is also necessary to take account of changes in the income tax burden and mortgage interest rates. This applies whether generally or in relation to Dublin or any other area of the country. Analysis of housing affordability carried out on behalf of my Department on a national basis indicates that affordability of an average priced house for a household with two earners, on the average industrial and non-industrial wage respectively, has improved in recent years following a significant deterioration in affordability over the period 1993 to 1995.</P>
      <P>House prices have increased due to increased demand, which is fuelled by many factors, including strong economic growth, increasing employment, higher disposable incomes and low interest rates, and also by demographic factors such as growth in the key household population age groups. The cornerstone of Government housing strategy is to increase supply to meet increased demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers. The Government introduced a range of measures in Action on House Prices, April 1998, Action on the Housing Market, March 1999 and more recently in Action on Housing to accelerate the supply of housing, secure house price stabilisation, address affordability issues and bring balance to the market. A comprehensive range of initiatives has been implemented to increase supply and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers, who benefit from exemptions and preferential rates of stamp duty. These measures are working as indicated by the increase in housing output by 20% since 1997. Moreover, recent data indicate a growing proportion of first time purchasers in the market.</P>
      <P>Recent statistics also show a welcome moderating trend in house price increases. Provisional returns from lending institutions for the September 2000 quarter indicate that there has been a significant reduction in the level and rate of house price increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming to office, I have commissioned three reports on the housing market from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. Each of these reports contained evidence of strong investment demand for residential properties. The most recent report, The Housing Market in Ireland: an Economic Evaluation of Trends and Prospects, published in June 2000, referred to the buoyant demand for residential investment properties and also to evidence that investor activity was pricing first time purchasers out of the market, particularly at the lower price range.</P>
      <P>The Government has responded positively to the findings of these reports in Action on House Prices, April 1998, Action on the Housing Market, March 1999 and earlier this year in Action on Housing. Government strategy, which is proving effective, is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers. In Action on Housing the Government adopted a number of measures, including changes to stamp duty, to ease the burden on first time buyers and owner-occupiers and to discourage speculative investment which was negatively impacting on the ability of first time buyers to enter the market. A temporary anti-speculative tax was also introduced for a period of three years to discourage short-term speculative investment by those seeking to make a quick capital gain, with exemptions for landlords who comply with specific regulatory requirements, indicating a commitment to the long-term availability of the accommodation for renting. Recent evidence, indicates that first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market, which may be attributed to reduced investor activity in response to the measures introduced in Action on Housing and to increases in housing output at the lower end of the market.</P>
      <P>As regards the issue of higher rents for tenants following the Bacon reports, the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute survey data for rents showed increases in Dublin of 24% in the period November 1997 to November 1998 and 15% in the period November 1998 to November 1999, the larger increase relating to a period during which the first Bacon report was produced and before the full effects of the Government's response would have been felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government aims to develop a thriving, diverse and well managed private rented sector. In addition to measures designed to increase the <Col N="1062" /> overall supply of housing, actions taken in recent years include specific incentives for the provision of rented residential accommodation in urban renewal areas and for the provision of student accommodation. In relation to income tax relief in respect of rent paid by tenants in the private rented residential sector, this Government increased the ceiling for persons under 55 by 50% and doubled the ceiling for those over 55. This Government also established a Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector to make recommendations on a wide range of issues relating to the sector, including improved security of tenure, maintaining a fair and reasonable balance between the respective rights and obligations of tenants and increasing investment in and the supply of accommodation in the sector.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, published in July of this year, identified a growing need for accommodation in the private rented sector and set out a number of recommendations to increase supply, including recommendations aimed at increasing long-term investment in private rented accommodation. I intend to submit to Government comprehensive proposals in response to the report, including my response to the commission's recommendations relating to supply incentives, as soon as possible.</P>

This is three times the investment for these services over the 1994-99 period. In July of this year, I published the first water services investment programme under the new national development plan containing schemes with a value of £2.1 billion which sets out in detail the areas and projects that will benefit between 2000 and 2002. This is the first phase of a rolling three year programme that will run up to the conclusion of the NDP in 2006. Additional schemes will be added to the programme each year in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Funding for urban waste water infrastructure under the water services investment programme is focused on meeting the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive. This requires treatment of all waste water discharges from systems with a population equivalent of over 2000 by the end of 2005. One hundred and fifty five urban agglomerations have been identified by the EPA as requiring secondary treatment of waste water by the end of 2005 under the terms of the directive. The majority already are, or soon will be, in compliance. Priority is being given to advancing and completing work in respect of discharges from major urban centres, where an earlier deadline of 31 December 2000 applies; £728 million is being provided under the water services investment programme to complete the 24 schemes required by the end-2000 deadline. A further £421 million is being provided to complete the 62 schemes needed by 2005.</P>
      <P>Priority is also being given to the nine towns discharging to inland waters designated as sensitive to pollution in accordance with the directive, and required to have more stringent than secondary treatment. Nutrient reduction facilities are already in place in eight of these and construction is under way in the remaining case.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 my Department has been promoting a catchment-based national strategy on water quality to address all inputs of phosphorus from all sources. Major projects are well under way in relation to Loughs Ree, Derg and Leane and the Rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir. These projects are beginning to show positive results in certain areas, for example, Lough Derg has been reclassified as &ldquo;moderately eutrophic&rdquo; compared to an earlier classification of &ldquo;strongly eutrophic&rdquo;. Recent monitoring data indicate that the improvement is continuing. The Department is now promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address all inland and coastal waters, including ground waters, and all sources of pollution and other impacts of human activities on water quality and quantity. Financial support at a rate of up to 85% will be available for expenditure incurred by local authorities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategies adopted by my Department and the level of funding now being provided will ensure that very significant progress up to and beyond meeting the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive will be achieved <Col N="1065" /> during the course of the current national development plan.</P>

      <P>My Department has not carried out any specific examination of water usage by individual consumers. Studies have, however, been completed in Dublin and nationally to assist in identifying remedial measures necessary to reduce levels of leakage within public distribution systems, including rehabilitation of defective pipework. Arising from these studies major water conservation programmes, including extensive network rehabilitation, in Dublin and locations such as Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Athlone and Clonmel are now being funded as part of my Department's water services investment programme. In the Dublin region the investment has resulted in a reduction in leakage from 42.5% to 28.7%.</P>
      <P>I will shortly announce significant additional funding for similar schemes in the areas identified by the studies as requiring remedial action.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 298 and 360 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March last year indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. In addition, the housing needs of a further 6,400 households were considered by local authorities as being most suitably met by other measures, including voluntary housing, rent supplementation and other social housing schemes. A breakdown of the results for each local authority is contained in the Housing Statistics Bulletin, September quarter, 1999, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. I am satisfied that the assessment provided a true reflection of the level of housing need in the individual local authorities. Statutory assessments of local authority housing needs are major undertakings which are normally carried out every three years. While many local authorities have updated their waiting lists on an informal basis since the last statutory assessment, these updatings would not, for example, include inspection of applicants' accommodation and the figures would not be strictly comparable to those derived from the statutory assessment.</P>

      <Quest>the progress being made in relation to affordable housing schemes throughout the country; if the targets set out have been met; the proposals he has to alter the thresholds of eligibility for these schemes and loans; and the proposals he has to increase the level of State subsidy for affordable schemes and to introduce greater uniformity between Dublin and the rest of the country in terms of subsidies for private sites for affordable house sites.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Details in relation to activity under the affordable housing scheme are published in my Department's quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletin. While progress to date under the scheme is slower than I had hoped for, I am confident that the measures to increase the supply of affordable housing set out in Action for Housing will ensure a substantial increase in the provision of affordable housing. Under these I increased the income eligibility thresholds for applicants under the scheme with effect from 15 <Col N="1067" /> June this year. For a single income household the income eligibility limit was increased from £20,000 to £25,000. In the case of a two income household the eligibility limit was raised from £50,000 to £62,500 using the formula 2.5 times A+B where A is the principal income and B is the subsidiary lesser income. The income limit for availing of the mortgage subsidy under the affordable housing scheme was also increased from £16,000 to £20,000 per annum and the subsidy levels payable have also been increased. The maximum local authority loan limit was increased to £100,000, which in the case of the affordable housing scheme can be 95% of the cost of the house, subject to the purchaser's ability to pay by reference to net income of the household.</P>
      <P>In addition, and as part of the improvements to the terms of the scheme, a site subsidy is now payable by my Department to local authorities to enable them to provide houses at an affordable price and at a sufficient discount from market value. The maximum level of subsidy is £30,000 or the cost of the site, whichever is the lesser, in the major urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford and £25,000 in other areas. This differential is to take account of the higher cost of development land in the major urban centres.</P>

      <P>Legislation is currently being prepared by my Department to address a range of consumer protection issues in relation to housing. Among the provisions being considered are requirements regarding the advertising by developers of the sale of new housing developments, so that prospective purchasers are fully informed about the number of houses being sold in any particular phase and the price of each property being offered for sale. Requirements will also be set down to ensure that booking deposits are properly receipted and fully refundable if the transaction does not proceed. I also propose to limit the practice of stage payments, which I consider to be an unfair practice, as stage payments expose the house purchaser to an unacceptable degree of risk by transferring the funding cost of construction and the development risk from the developer to the purchaser. Other consumer protection legislation will include measures to inhibit the scope for gazumping. Consideration of any measures to regulate guide prices at auction would have to take account of the free market nature of an auction and the difficulties inherent <Col N="1068" /> in devising a methodology to establish an accurate guide price in such a free market.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have wide powers under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, to provide and fund the cost of accommodation for homeless people. This includes the cost of accommodation arranged directly by the local authorities or on their behalf by health boards and voluntary bodies with whom the local authorities work closely in regard to meeting the needs of homeless persons. My Department recoups 90% of local authorities expenditure on accommodation for the homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the section 10 bed-night contribution rate is agreed between the local authority and the voluntary body, the Department has recom<Col N="1069" /> mended that the minimum rate should be £10 per bed-night. Higher rates may be agreed if individual circumstances warrant it, however, the Department must be consulted in advance of any such agreement.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government's strategy on homelessness provides for capital spending on the direct provision by local authorities of suitable accommodation for homeless persons to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years. Additional current funding of £6 million per annum will also be available from my Department to increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation and to establish settlement/outreach services. Additional funding of £6 million will be available from the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care and specialist support for homeless persons in hostels.</P>
    <P>My Department's voluntary housing capital assistance scheme is the major source of funding for the provision by voluntary housing organisations of hostel and sheltered housing accommodation for homeless persons. The provision for the scheme has been increased from £16.5 million in 1999 to £26 million for the present year.</P>
    <P>Addiction can sometimes play a significant part in people becoming homeless. In such cases, the provision of accommodation will not, on its own, suffice and accompanying support services will also be required. For this reason, a special £5 million allocation over the two years 2000 and 2001 was made in the last budget for the provision of two high support hostels for homeless people suffering from drug and alcohol addiction. The allocation was made available to Dublin Corporation to build or acquire and redevelop suitable premises for these purposes. This allocation was in addition to the £4 million allocation in the public capital programme for the provision by local authorities of hostel accommodation this year.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Bill, 2000, seeks to replace 19th century terminology with modern language of relevance to Irish society in the 21st century. To reflect this, the 19th century statutory reference to borough is changed to town, as was proposed by the previous Government in its White Paper, Better Local Government; and recommended by expert reports such as Barrington, 1990, and the Commission on Town Local Government, 1996.</P>

In this context, as part of a meeting with AMAI representatives, I will be meeting the five mayors to discuss their concerns and possible adjustments to the Bill.</P>

      <P>To assist designers of social housing, my Department has published social housing design guidelines which provide general design guidance at the levels of both the overall scheme and the individual dwelling unit. The purpose of these guidelines is to identify principles and criteria that are important for the design of social housing and to highlight specific design features, requirements and standards that, from experience, have been found to be particularly relevant. Guidelines for residential developments in areas designated for urban renewal have also been issued by my Department with particular emphasis on apartment developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> The standards applicable to the planning and design of private housing schemes are governed by the requirements of the development plan for the area in which the housing is to be constructed. Planning permission is required for all private housing developments and, in making its decisions, the planning authority will have regard to the criteria for planning and design of housing developments contained in its own development plan.</P>
    <P>The guidelines for planning authorities on residential density, which were published in September 1999, indicate that higher residential densities must not be achieved at an unacceptable amenity cost to the surrounding dwellings and the residents of the proposed development. A high quality of design and layout and a good quality living environment, including the availability of adequate shopping, social, transport and leisure infrastructure, are essential if increased residential densities are to be acceptable.</P>
    <P>A joint housing committee, representative of my Department and the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, organise periodic national housing conferences. The agenda for the next conference, which is being planned for April of next year, includes issues relating to good planning and design in housing.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has adopted a policy on architecture and an interdepartmental working group, under the aegis of the Department of the Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, is currently examining ways and means of advancing this policy.</P>

      <P>There has been a widespread dissatisfaction for many years because of the perception that grants from my Department to support local authorities' current expenditure have not been distributed on an equitable basis. The development of the needs and resources model is an attempt to facilitate the allocation of monies from the local government fund on a basis which supports the ability of all local authorities to provide services of a high standard and creates greater transparency and objectivity in the shareout of these funds.</P>
      <P>For the first time, the model allows for the individual circumstances of local authorities, in terms of their needs and resources, to be taken into account in a measured way in the determination of grants. I am satisfied that the underlying methodology of the model, which is the prototype, provides the basis for a far more equitable method of allocating local government fund grants than the previous system. However, I would add that the model is still in its early stages of development and will require refinement and expansion on an ongoing basis to become more sensitive to the challenges of individual authorities or groups of authorities. In this regard, my Department will be establishing a process to review and improve the model and it is my intention that local authorities themselves will be directly involved in this process. As a first step, my Department will organise before the end of the year a number of regional seminars for local authorities to examine the model.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national building regulations prescribe minimum construction standards for new private and local authority dwellings. Part D of the regulations requires that new dwellings be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner. I consolidated the regulations in 1997, following a two year review which took into account the outcome of a public consultation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> Compliance with the regulations is primarily a matter for the designers, builders and owners of the new houses involved. It is advisable for the purchaser of a private dwelling to retain a solicitor to advise on the terms and enforcement of the contract with the builder or developer; and a building professional to inspect and report on the quality of the new dwelling involved.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the relevant local building control authority. On becoming Minister in 1997, I found that the level of enforcement was far from satisfactory. I have taken a number of measures to improve enforcement at local level including sanctioning the creation of additional posts, where necessary, to allow building control officers and supporting staff to be appointed and increasing building control fees, with effect from 1 July 1998, to provide local funding for stricter enforcement.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that these measures are yielding results. All authorities have appointed building control officers. About 85% of authorities are now carrying out inspections; and almost two-thirds have reached the target level of inspection &ndash; 12% to 15% of developments &ndash; recommended in the 1995 guidelines adopted by the City and County Managers Association. I have asked managers of the remaining authorities to ensure that the target is reached no later than end 2000, where inspections had started in August 2000, or mid-2001, where inspections had not started.</P>
    <P>A new house for which a first time purchase grant, £3,000, is paid must comply with the building regulations; and grant-eligible new houses are inspected by my Department. HomeBond issues structural guarantees for new houses and arranges inspections of new houses for which such guarantees are sought.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323, 339, 340, 341 and 342 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am close to finalising the retail planning guidelines and will issue them very shortly under <Col N="1078" /> section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which I commenced with effect from 1 November 2000. In the meantime it would not be appropriate to go into any details.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) General Policy Directive (Shopping), 1998, which is currently in force, limits the retail floorspace of supermarkets to 3,000 square metres net. The draft retail planning guidelines, published in April 1999, proposed that this limit should remain in force in the remainder of the State outside the greater Dublin area, but that in the greater Dublin area, the floorspace limit on foodstores should be increased to 3,500 square metres. In finalising the guidelines, regard is being had to the outcome of the public consultation and the study which I had carried out on the economic impact of implementing the guidelines.</P>
    <P>The draft retail planning guidelines proposed that each county council and county borough corporation should prepare retail policies for its administrative area. This will be important to ensure that retail planning policy as expressed in the development plan is tailored to local circumstances. I am confident that local authorities will have sufficient resources to carry out this task effectively. In many cases, local authorities may choose to engage consultants with specific expertise in relation to retail planning.</P>
    <P>The hierarchical approach to retail planning as set out in the draft retail planning guidelines, which dictates that retail developments should be of appropriate scale, is a fundamental element of development planning in delivering retail structures that support the maintenance of vibrant and viable centres. I am confident that the hierarchical approach allied to the cap on the size of superstores will be effective.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that multiple stores are using various mechanisms in terms of the definition of the sale of goods to circumvent the current control on retail development which I introduced under the Local Government (Planning and Development) General Policy Directive (Shopping), 1998. One of the issues being considered in finalising the guidelines is the clarity of the definitions used. I am satisfied that the interim floorspace cap introduced by the 1998 directive is working well. If the cap had not been introduced, it is probable that a substantial number of superstores would have been built, thereby rendering the final guidelines fruitless.</P>

      <P>Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, provides for an assessment, at least every three years, by local authorities of the need for the provision of adequate and suitable housing accommodation.</P>
      <P>The results of the last local authority assessment of housing needs in March 1999 indicated that 3,743 households, or 5,234 persons, were assessed as homeless. This is based on a broad definition of homeless persons which includes those who have no accommodation, those in hostels and those in health board accommodation. Of the 5,234 homeless persons, 49.54%, or 2,593, were male, 26.73%, or 1,399, were female and 23.73%, or 1,242, were children.</P>
      <P>The results of this assessment were published by my Department in October 1999 and copies are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's strategy on homelessness, a homeless forum is being established at each city and county level three year action plans are being drawn up to meet the needs of homeless persons in their areas. These plans will detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved in providing these services. As part of the development of these plans, I have asked that all existing services for the homeless be examined with a view to identifying any service gaps or deficiencies which exist, together with appropriate responses to deal with these gaps or deficiencies. These action plans will include up to date information on the scale of homelessness.</P>

The other two, Longford and South Dublin County Councils, are not yet in a position to hold their first meetings, although necessary preparatory work is in hands.</P>
      <P>The strategic policy committees are a central plank in the Government's policy for the renewal of the local government system. I am anxious to ensure that all SPCs are fully operational without delay. With this in mind, later this month, I will be launching an intensive programme focused on key policy issues for all SPC chairs. This programme will be implemented in the coming months and will effectively be the precursor to the network of SPC chairs-directors of services and my Department. These networks will play an essential role in ensuring that the SPCs achieve their full potential in the development and monitoring of local authority policies.</P>
      <P>With regard to servicing the SPCs, I understand that, while unions nationally have lifted their objections, there may be problems locally in a few authorities.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the scheme of improvement works to private houses in lieu of local authority housing. This scheme enables a local authority to improve or extend privately owned accommodation occupied or intended to be occupied by an approved applicant for local authority housing as an alternative to the provision of local authority accommodation.</P>
      <P>My Department recently completed an examination of the cost limit of works which may be carried out to any house under the scheme without the prior approval of my Department. Accordingly, from 1 November 2000 the threshold limit for works which may be carried out without the prior approval of my Department was raised from £20,000 to £50,000. This new threshold will allow local authorities to proceed with a higher proportion of improvement works without requiring my Department's prior approval.</P>
      <P>Applicants who benefit from works carried out under the scheme are required to make repayments to the local authority related to the cost of the works and the applicant's ability to pay.  In order to protect the expenditure of public funds on private property, it is necessary for the local authority to enter into a legal agreement with applicants.</P>
      <P>I am aware of capacity constraints in the building industry which are impacting on the delivery of various social housing measures. The final report of the forum for the construction industry, Expanding the Capacity of the Construction Industry, was published last month. An interdepartmental group, led by my Department, is now finalising an action plan to increase the overall capacity of the construction industry including the housing sector, drawing on the forum's recommendations. This action plan will be published shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the management and maintenance of their rented dwellings is the responsibility of local authorities, my Department plays an important role in providing support and guidance to the authorities in their efforts to better manage their estates. In recent years my Department introduced a number of initiatives in this regard, including: Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, local authorities are required to adopt statements of policy on housing management and this has provided a mechanism to require authorities to focus on housing management issues. All major authorities have adopted such policy statements which are revised from time to time as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The housing management initiative grants scheme is designed to support innovative pilot projects in the area of local authority housing management by way of grant assistance from my Department. Since its inception in 1995, over 100 projects have been approved. Approximately 50% of the projects funded to date have involved staff and tenant training in estate management. Other projects included supporting research, production of tenant's handbooks and the employment of tenant liaison officers. It is proposed to undertake an evaluation of the scheme over the coming months.</P>
      <P>A specialist housing unit was established in March 1998 as a joint pilot initiative between my Department and the county and city managers. The remit of the unit, which has a full-time director and administrative support, is to assist local authorities to develop a more strategic approach to housing management. It also has a role in promoting and disseminating good practice in all aspects of housing management, identifying training needs of housing practitioners and devising programmes and strategies to meet these needs. A consultative committee representative of my Department, local authorities, tenants, and the voluntary sector, provides policy advice and guidance and oversees the work of the unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> The unit, in co-operation with my Department and local authorities, recently produced new guidelines on good practice in the repair and maintenance of local authority dwellings. Work is progressing on further guidelines on the subject of rents, empty property management, dealing with anti-social behaviour and tenant participation in estate management. The unit organised the third annual local authority housing practitioners conference which took place in Ennis on 18 and 19 October last.</P>
    <P>The unit supports and facilitates the regional networks of local authority housing practitioners that comprise representatives of both administrative and technical staff in the housing area. These networks provide a forum for discussion on housing issues and promote the dissemination of good practice. They are also a vehicle for consultation and communication between the Department and local authorities on housing matters.</P>
    <P>The remedial works scheme provides capital funding for major essential works to local authority dwellings with serious design or construction defects and to severely run down estates. Under recent changes to the scheme, the cost of establishing new or improved estate management arrangements, including tenant involvement and participation, may be allowed up to a limit of £10,000 in the case of estates of fewer than 20 houses and £20,000 in estates of 20 or more houses.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are required to provide a programme of tenant development and information courses for tenants of new housing schemes. They are also encouraged to provide such programmes for the tenants and residents of existing housing estates. My Department has provided funding &ndash; £52,000 &ndash; towards the development by the RESPOND voluntary housing organisation of a formally accredited certificate in housing studies. The course specialises in estate management training for local authority and voluntary sector staff and members of community/residents groups.</P>
    <P>I recognise the central role of local authorities in estate management and will continue to develop policies and initiatives to encourage and to assist authorities in this regard.</P>

      <P>Fees from member businesses finance Repak Ltd's activities. The company commenced this year with a substantial capital balance, and income is expected to exceed £10 million over the year. Revenue generated has to date been applied mainly to support the collection and recovery of packaging waste from the domestic waste stream, and in this regard funding has been provided in support of Kerbside Dublin, Gandon Enterprises Ltd., the Rehab Recycling Partnership, and a number of companies engaged in waste recovery activities. The company is also providing a free uplift service for in-house packaging waste generated by members this year. Repak recently announced details of a new payments scheme to incentivise waste contractors to recover additional volumes of packaging waste. Repak funding is also available for the establishment by local authorities of segregated household waste collection services such as that initiated in the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, I appointed consultants to review and evaluate Repak's performance to date; the prospects for achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery target for 2001, having regard to the activities of Repak and other relevant or prospective developments; and the additional measures or structures which appear to be required in order the meet Ireland's packaging waste recycling/recovery targets for 2006.</P>
      <P>This review will include recommendations regarding further measures that could be undertaken by Repak Ltd. to support the recovery of packaging waste from the municipal waste stream, increase the recovery rate for packaging waste generally and support the development of indigenous reprocessing capacity for packaging waste.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Each local authority is responsible for the enforcement of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, within its functional area, and all authorities are expected to take requisite measures to ensure that packaging producers comply with their obligations under the regulations. The Environmental Protection Agency has been tasked with a range of special<Col N="1087" /> ised and complex functions, which are either inappropriate to, or require expertise which is unavailable to, local authorities generally. On this basis, it is not apparent that enforcement of the 1997 regulations is a function which is appropriate to the agency, or that it could reasonably be expected to deploy resources equivalent to those cumulatively available to local authorities around the country. However, I will review this matter in light of any relevant recommendations in the forthcoming consultancy report.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities. Stringent standards for coliform levels in drinking water are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 81 of 1988). Article 4 of these regulations places a duty on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that water intended for human consumption meets these standards.

The report for 1999 is being prepared for publication during the current year. These provide detailed information on water quality by reference to all the prescribed parameters. The report for 1998 found the overall quality of public drinking water supplies to be satisfactory but noted a high level of non-compliance in relation to private group water supplies serving some 5% of households, many of <Col N="1089" /> which receive inadequate or no treatment. The group scheme sector is the subject of a comprehensive programme of measures for improvement under the rural water programme.</P>
    <P>The parameters of most importance for all drinking water supplies are total and faecal coliforms. A zero standard is prescribed in relation to total and faecal coliforms. The presence of one coliform renders a sample non-compliant.</P>
    <P>The EPA report for 1998 indicates that there is virtually full compliance with the total and faecal coliforms standards in the largest public supplies, supplying the largest proportion of the population, with non-compliance recorded in some smaller public supplies. It also states that 92% of public supplies examined are free of all coliforms and that two-fifths of the remainder are free of faecal coliforms. To date, this is the highest rate of compliance achieved. Many of the non-compliant samples fail to comply only because of the presence, generally in extremely small numbers, of total coliforms unaccompanied by faecal coliforms. It is, nevertheless, unacceptable that any supplies should contain non-faecal and faecal coliforms and I will continue to impress upon sanitary authorities the need to put the necessary measures in place to secure full compliance with water quality standards. As I indicated, a comprehensive programme of measures is in place to address water quality problems in private group schemes under the rural water programme.</P>
    <P>E-coli 0157 is a particular type of faecal coliform which can cause serious illness in humans. Contamination by E-coli 0157 generally arises in relation to infection throughout the food chain and, in so far as I am aware, the presence of E-coli 0157 has not been detected in any drinking water supplies in Ireland. Advice and information leaflets are available from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on measures that should be taken to prevent the spread of E-coli 0157 infection in the home and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The report of the Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; EPA &ndash; Water Quality in Ireland 1995-1997, indicated a marked improvement in the water quality in Lough Derg and classified the lake as moderately eutrophic. It is understood that more recent data indicate a continuing improvement in Lough Derg.</P>
      <P>Water quality in Lough Derg is being comprehensively addressed in the context of the Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment water quality monitoring and management project, which is administered jointly by Clare County Council and Roscommon County Council. This project is being undertaken in conjunction with a major investment programme which will upgrade the sewerage networks and waste water treatment plants at 17 of the main population centres within the catchment. Over £48 million has been allocated to the schemes, with 85% financial support provided by the EU Cohesion Fund, and substantial progress is being made in their delivery.</P>
      <P>The Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment water quality monitoring and management project aims at establishing a monitoring and management system in the Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment. The project takes account of the EPA report, Quantification of Phosphorus Loss from Soil to Water, which was published in April 2000. A final project report is expected early in 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 361 to 363, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The interest rate on local authority housing loans is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to mortgage rates prevailing in the financial market. The current variable rate to borrowers is 5.75%. The current fixed interest rate available on local authority loans is 6.5% for a period of five years. These rates compare favourably with the equivalent rates charged by commercial lending agencies.</P>
      <P>Certain fixed interest rate loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 carry rates in excess of these levels. These fixed interest rates reflect the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and are fixed for the life of the loan. The costs of reducing the fixed rates on these loans would be substantial and would have to be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free, since 1980, to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This is a very significant concession. Borrowers with building society-bank fixed rate mortgages on the other hand are obliged to pay significant redemption penalties of up to six months interest or more in the event of early redemption.</P>
      <P>In the past five years the amount outstanding to the local loans fund and the Housing Finance Agency in fixed interest rate loans has reduced significantly, from £509 million to £218 million, indicating that many borrowers have availed of this concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 367 and 370 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for expenditure of almost £3 billion over the period 2000-2006 on water and sewerage infrastructure. This includes £1.1 billion for wastewater schemes, £550 million for rehabilitation and management of water and wastewater infrastructure, £464 million for water and wastewater schemes to support economic and social activity and £420 million for the rural water programme. This is approximately three times the size of the expenditure for these services by comparison to the 1994-1999 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July of this year I announced the first phase of a rolling three-year water services investment programme to cover the period 2000 to 2002, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The programme will be rolled forward by one year at a time up to the end of the national development plan. The schemes contained in the 2000-02 programme are drawn mainly from the results of the assessments completed by local <Col N="1095" /> authorities in response to my Department's request in October 1998 for all authorities to prepare and submit prioritised lists of the needs for capital water and sewerage works in their areas. The assessments, which have a medium-term horizon to the end of 2006 and a longer term horizon covering the 20 year period commencing in 1999, have helped to quantify the amount of investment needed to support future economic and social development, as reflected in the new national development plan.</P>
    <P>The increased investment provided for water services infrastructure in the national development plan is an acceleration of the pattern of recent years which has seen spending on these schemes in 1999 increase by 50% over the 1998 figure and to twice the 1996 level. The expected out-turn for 2000 is a further increase to £335 million. The 2000-2002 programme provides for the ongoing construction of 79 major water and sewerage schemes, 113 schemes to commence construction in the years 2000-2002, 131 new schemes to begin planning and 206 schemes under the serviced land and rural towns and villages initiatives. Further schemes will be added to the programme each year up to 2006.</P>
    <P>To assist in determining future water supply system development requirements, studies have been undertaken of all medium to large public water supplies to assess the adequacy of existing systems for the areas served and to formulate proposals for improving inadequate supplies to cater for existing and future demand. I will shortly be announcing significant additional funding to implement the recommendations of these studies.</P>
    <P>In relation to rural water supplies, the Department has asked county councils, in consultation with the voluntary group sector, to prepare strategic rural water plans which will map out the best approach to the provision of adequate water supplies to households served by private group or individual supplies. As part of this process, an assessment will be made of existing levels of services, quality of sources and current and future demand.</P>
    <P>Funding for urban wastewater infrastructure under the water services investment programme is focused on meeting the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive. This requires that all wastewater discharges from systems with a population equivalent greater than 2,000 be treated by 31 December 2005. A more immediate deadline of end 2000 applies to treatment of discharges of 15,000 p.e., which covers all our major cities and towns, including Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Dundalk and Drogheda. Projects are well advanced in respect of all these areas which account for approximately 80% of all urban wastewater. The national development plan provides for an investment of £728 million to complete the 24 waste water schemes that are required by the end of 2000 while £421 million is being provided for 62 <Col N="1096" /> additional schemes to meet the 2005 requirements.</P>

The assessment was taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-2002, announced in July, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. This is the first phase of a rolling programme that will continue up to the end of the current national development plan in 2006.

      <Col N="1098" /> Local authorities may provide housing sites at low cost to assist persons in housing need to provide their own housing. My Department has encouraged local authorities to review the scope for expanding the use of the sale of sites scheme in order to meet increasing housing needs. My Department have also advised local authorities that should they require additional funds under the scheme it is open to them to make adjustments within their overall housing capital allocations to cater for any increased demand for private sites that may arise.</P>
    <P>The affordable housing scheme involves the provision by local authorities of new houses for sale to eligible purchasers at a discount from the market value. As part of the measures to increase the supply of affordable housing set out in Action on Housing I introduced a site subsidy for houses provided by local authorities under the affordable housing scheme and also in respect of new houses sold by local authorities under the shared ownership scheme. The level of subsidy is £30,000 in the major urban areas and £25,000 in other areas.</P>

While at one stage during the discussion I referred to this information as a commissioned study, I subsequently referred to the information more accurately as published information from the retail studies centre at UCD.

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a retirement pension at a reduced personal rate of £94.10 per week. The maximum rate of retirement pension is £96 per week.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of this pension at the maximum rate is that a person must have a yearly average of at least 48 social insurance contributions paid or credited over his or her working life i.e. from 1953, (or the date of entry into insurable employment, if later, to the end of the tax year before he or she reaches age 65. A reduced personal rate of pension of £94.10 per week applies where the yearly average is between 24 and 47.</P>
      <P>According to my Department's records, the person concerned entered into insurable employment in 1958. Over the 27 year period from 1958 to April 1985, i.e. the end of the tax year before he reached age 65, he recorded a total of 655 reckonable contributions. This gives a yearly average of 24 which qualifies him for the reduced rate of pension he is currently receiving.</P>
      <P>There is no record of contributions paid in respect of the person in question for the period 1961-62 to 1974-75. Prior to April 1974, non-manual employees were not liable to pay social insurance contributions, where their earnings exceeded a specified remuneration limit. This earnings limit was abolished with effect from 1 April 1974.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned is currently residing alone, he may qualify for a living alone allowance of £6 per week from my Department. In that event he should advise the Department and arrangements will be made to pay this allowance to him. When he reaches age 80 in March 2001, an age-related increase of £5 per week will be paid to him.</P>

These included firstly a limited number of self employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory social insurance was introduced for the self employed in 1988, and secondly <Col N="1101" /> people with appropriate contributions paid prior to 1953 who cannot satisfy the normal yearly average test. In both cases 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate are required to qualify for a pension of 50% of the maximum personal rate.

      <P>Entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension is subject to a means test. Items which count as means include cash income, the value of any property, excluding the person's own home, and the value of any investments and capital which a person may have. The pension is subject to periodic means review and there is an obligation on recipients to inform my Department of any change in means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Means tested payments are not paid for extended periods to people who are resident outside the state. Old age non-contributory pen<Col N="1102" /> sioners who intend leaving the State must inform my Department in advance. On return, a backdated payment of up to 13 weeks will be made once my Department is notified. A payment will not be made for absences exceeding thirteen weeks unless there are exceptional circumstances involved, such as serious illness. However, where a person who is in receipt of old age non-contributory pension, takes up residence in Northern Ireland, payment of pension may continue for a period up to five years or until the person receives an equivalent payment from the Northern Ireland authorities if earlier.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to an old age contributory pension is based on insurance contributions, paid and credited, over a person's working life. A minimum number of full rate insurance contributions must be paid and a yearly average test must normally be satisfied. Contributory pensions are not subject to a means test and there are no restrictions on the payment of old age contributory pension while outside the State.</P>
    <P>Where persons have entitlement to both a contributory and a non-contributory pension they are paid whichever is more favourable to them. Where a reduced rate of contributory pension is payable due to a deficiency in the persons contribution record, it is frequently the case that the non-contributory pension is more advantageous.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any particular difficulty or stigma associated with the present pension scheme titles, which solely convey the basis on which the various social insurance and assistance payments are derived.</P>
    <P>In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the person concerned qualified for an old age contributory pension at the weekly rate of £48.00 with effect from 5 May 2000 under the special provisions which I introduced this year to take account of pre-1953 national health insurance contributions for pension purposes. However she is currently receiving an old age non-contributory pension of £85.50 per week and the half-rate old age contributory pension cannot be paid in addition. The person concerned is financially better off to remain on old age non-contributory pension.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> The policy direction over the past number of years has been to concentrate resources on improving child benefit for all families. Since I came into office I have increased the lower rate of CB from £30 to £42.50 per month, and the higher rate from £39 to £56 per month. It is my intention to continue these substantial improvements in CB rates, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children over the period of the PPF, in fulfilment of the Government's commitment.</P>
    <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years; however, where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.</P>
    <P>Currently, this applies to long-term payments, such as pensions, only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. However, the Government had made a commitment in the PPF to extend child dependant allowances to all social welfare recipients, where the child is under 22 and in full-time education in the course of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>Any proposals to extend CB entitlement to all children in full-time education would be costly and would have to be considered in the light of available resources and overall budgetary priorities.</P>

They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free <Col N="1104" /> schemes retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    <P>The free schemes are also available to low-income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means-test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, currently £96.00 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £101.00 for a recipient aged 80 years or over, plus £30.00, plus any increases for a qualified adult, dependent children, living alone, as appropriate. The make-up of this income limit means that it increases automatically each year on foot of the budget increases in pension rates.</P>
    <P>From October this year, the free schemes have been extended to all persons aged 75 and over, regardless of their income and household composition.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward by the Deputy for further extending the free schemes will be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to the availability of resources and other priorities.</P>

      <P>The one-parent family payment, is the main income support scheme available for lone parents, including those who are separated. The scheme is means tested and is intended to act as a safety net for those who have been unable to secure adequate maintenance for themselves and-or their children.</P>
      <P>Under the means test associated with the scheme all maintenance received, apart from an allowance of £75 per week of maintenance paid in respect of vouched housing costs, is assessed in determining a person's eligibility to receive the OFP. The review of the one-parent family payment, which was recently published by my Department, has proposed improvements in the way maintenance is treated under the scheme and this is being considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OFP is a social assistance scheme and in common with other schemes of this nature a person's means are assessed in determining his-her entitlement. This is to ensure that resources are targeted at those who are most in need. Making the scheme available to separated people dependent only on maintenance payments would not be in keeping with this general aim. In the circumstances, it is not proposed to amend the qualify<Col N="1105" /> ing conditions along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of this Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
    <P>In the case of separated parents who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment, the health board will assess the application under exceptional needs payments, under the SWA scheme. There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP. The payment is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.</P>
    <P>Qualifying conditions for the school books and community employment schemes are a matter for the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, respectively.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nation-wide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. The Government is committed to completing all interim county surveys within the next two years and the complete national inventory within a period of twelve years.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning &amp; Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority must, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. Under section 4 of the Act, I may recommend to a planning authority that specific structures be included in its record of protected structures. To date, I have recommended that 791 buildings be included in the record of protected structures of a number of planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives <Col N="1106" /> planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 202 of 10 October a policing plan was put in place in the Bridewell Garda station for the Halloween period. As part of this plan, St. Bricin's Park, along with fifteen other locations were identified by patrols as high priority areas. I am further informed that in the lead up to Halloween, the complex was visited by Garda patrols and that there was no stockpiling of bonfire material in any open areas.</P>
      <P>I understand that on Halloween night, a public order van with one sergeant and three gardaí was deployed in addition to normal resources. It appears that local youths carried material to a small bonfire site at 6 p.m. and lit the material immediately. As the gardaí considered that this bonfire was of a minor nature and would burn itself out, without posing any threat to persons or property, the fire brigade was not called. Six youths, who are resident in St. Bricin's Park, were subsequently moved away from the site of the fire.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the local corporation depot was contacted by the gardaí and removed the debris the following day. I believe that local gardaí suspect that the material used on this small bonfire was hidden in some garden until immediately before its use on Halloween night.</P>

      <P>Despite discussions with all four Garda associations, under the auspices of the Department of an Taoiseach and with the participation of officials from the Department of Finance and my own Department, it was not possible to identify a mechanism for the involvement of all four associations in the discussions which lead to national programmes and the pay agreements which form part of those programmes. It is hoped some appropriate arrangement can be made to involve the associations before discussions take place on the successor to the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Regarding the right of gardaí to join trade unions, the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, as amended by the Garda Síochána Act, 1977, provides that it shall not be lawful for a member of the Garda Síochána to be or to become a member of a trade union or of any association other than an association established under the Act. The Act also makes it an offence for a person to cause dissatisfaction or to induce any member of the Garda Síochána to withhold his or her services. These restrictions are confirmed in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990. There are no plans to change these legal provisions. Under section 13(5) of the 1924 Act, as inserted by the 1977 Act, I may, from time to time, authorise the Garda associations established under the acts to be associated with a person or body outside the Garda Síochána subject to certain restrictions which I may deem necessary to specify. This section can only be invoked where I am satisfied that the body to which an association wishes to be affiliated would not be incompatible with the status and duties of members of a disciplined police force, to which the necessary legal prohibitions in relation to trade union membership and withdrawal of services apply. Garda associations have been authorised to affiliate with the ICPSA, that is, the Irish Conference of Professional Service Associations. They have also been authorised, of course, to affiliate to international police organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the Garda associations participate fully in the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme. The scheme, which is similar to schemes operating elsewhere in the public service, provides for a conciliation council and arbitration board, both of which are designed to deal exclusively with pay and other specified conditions of service of members of all ranks of the Garda Síochána up to and including the rank of Chief Superintendent. The scheme, I believe, works well as is evidenced by the fact that the <Col N="1108" /> Garda associations have secured significant benefits under it for their members.</P>

      <Col N="1109" /> The community service supervisor is currently being paid an hourly rate of £8.36 &ndash; this includes the recent increase under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The overall cost of providing community service supervisors in 1999 was £927,000, which included, retrospective payments made in 1999, dating back to 1997, on foot of an award in the labour relations adjudication for sessional supervisors. It is expected that the cost in 2000 will be in the region of £900,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remember that Garda CCTV systems are an aid to existing Garda resources. As such, they must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>
      <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting, etc.</P>
      <P>Three Garda CCTV systems have been installed to date in the State &ndash; in Temple Bar, Dublin; in Dublin North Central, which includes O'Connell Street and its adjoining areas and in Tralee, County Kerry. The combined cost of the CCTV systems was in excess of £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications has received in excess of 40 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems. Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of such systems. These are, in alphabetical order: Bray, Cork, Dublin South Central, Dundalk, Finglas, and Limerick. The remaining applications are under consideration by the CCTV advisory committee and their recommendations will be submitted to me in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin South Central consisting of 15 cameras <Col N="1110" /> which includes Grafton Street and its adjoining areas and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork city consisting of 29 cameras are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. Final costings are not yet available for these two projects, but it is envisaged that the final combined cost, including ancillary work, will be in excess of £1 million. The order in which the remaining priority locations will be undertaken has not yet been decided &ndash; although it is intended to commence the installation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Recently the Garda CCTV system in Dublin North Central was increased from 38 to 42 cameras. The CCTV system in Dublin South Central, when complete, will result in the cameras in the original Temple Bar area being increased from nine to 24 cameras to cover Grafton Street and its adjoining areas.</P>
    <P>Some delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects due, in part, to the fact that the demand from various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant. A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has also impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. Notwithstanding this, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required. I, therefore, decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area. The review is now complete and I expect to make a statement on CCTV in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>if there is any regulation or compulsion on employers generally or employers who recruit large numbers of women to provide child care places on site for their employees; if any of our EU partners have such regulations; if he will introduce a mandatory regulation here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25239/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no regulation or compulsion, within this jurisdiction, on employers either generally or those who recruit large numbers of women to provide child care places on site for their employees. I am not aware either of any such regulation in other member states.</P>
      <P>However, all EU member states including Ireland have underwritten in their national employment action plans to support employees in reconciling work and family life. In the case of Ireland, this involves interventions at many levels including State support for child care provision, statutory leave entitlements such as maternity, parental and adoptive leave and the provision by employers of family-friendly work arrangements for both women and men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> A number of developments have taken place here in the relation to the provision of child care places in the past two years. Child care was highlighted as a priority area for investment under the national development plan 2000-2006 with £250 million being allocated to my Department to support the provision of child care places over the life of the national development plan. In addition to the £250 million, I recently announced details of the Government's extra £40 million anti-inflationary package for child care.</P>
    <P>In April of this year, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants. Capital grants are available for community groups/not-for-profit organisations and self-employed child care providers while staffing grants are available for community groups-not-for-profit organisations. To date, I have allocated approximately £14 million to 166 child care facilities which will support the provision of almost 5,300 child care places, including over 2,200 new child care places.</P>
    <P>While there are no plans to introduce a requirement on employers such as that indicated in the Deputy's question, the Government has, however, provided incentives to encourage employers to take a role in the provision of child care for their employees.</P>
    <P>Budget 1999 provided for the exemption from tax of any benefit-in-kind arising from the provision of free or subsidised child care by employers or groups of employers for their employees. To qualify for this exemption, the employer must either make a premises available, or if a joint scheme, be involved in both the management and financing of the child care facility. However, this exemption does not apply if the employer simply pays or subsidises an employee's child care costs for an independent crèche or nursery.</P>
    <P>Another benefit to the employer in terms of tax relief is the capital allowance in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction, refurbishment or extension of a child care facility. This was introduced in budget 1999. Up to then, capital allowances were only available for the cost of furniture, fittings or equipment used in child care facility.</P>
    <P>Budget 2000 provided improvements in the capital allowance introduced in the previous budget. The new provisions mean that accelerated capital allowances can be availed of so that the costs incurred can be written off for tax purposes at the rate of 100% in the first year or, if preferred, spread out over seven years. To qualify for either tax relief, the child care service must be compliant with the Child Care (Pre-school Services) Regulations, 1996.</P>
    <P>In June this year, I launched a report commissioned by the equality authority with funding sourced under the Government's equal opportunities child care programme. This report, <Col N="1112" /> Investing in People &ndash; Family Friendly work arrangements in small and medium sized enterprises, sought to identify the range of family-friendly work arrangements already in place by small and medium-sized enterprises, examine the practicality of these arrangements and make recommendations for implementing family-friendly arrangements more widely in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.</P>
    <P>Another publication, Quality Childcare in the Workplace, by Barnardos was launched by me in June. This guide for employers, which was also funded under the Government's equal opportunities child care programme based in my Department, aimed to provide employers with information to assist them in introducing practical child-friendly measures to support parents in reconciling work and family life.</P>
    <P>Funding of £23.2 million is also being made available under the regional operational programmes of the national development plan 2000-2006 for positive actions for women. Approximately £4 million of this funding will be allocated to a project on family-friendly arrangements in employment. This funding has been allocated to my Department and will be used to support the work of the national framework committee for the development of family friendly policies which was set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This committee is supported by a secretariat provided by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with additional support, where appropriate, from my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides a range of school-based support services to cater for the special needs of pupils with Attention Deficit Disorder, ADD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD, and Asperger's Syndrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, where the condition is not of a serious nature, the children are capable of attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis, with the support where necessary of the resource teacher service. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system <Col N="1115" /> now have an automatic entitlement to the supports they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from education. There are currently over 660 full-time resource teacher post equivalents in place in the primary system to cater for such children.</P>
    <P>Where more pronounced forms of the conditions in question arise, children have access to a range of special schools and special classes attached to ordinary schools. Special schools and special classes, catering for children with ADD and ADHD, operate at a pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1. Special schools and special classes catering for children with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of high functioning autism, operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Children attending special schools and special classes also attract increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
    <P>The National Education Psychological Service also plays an important role with regard to assessment and educational provision for pupils exhibiting persistent and maladaptive levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.</P>
    <P>My Department also works in close co-operation with the health authorities to ensure that any necessary health care or therapeutic services are made available to the pupils.</P>
    <P>I recently established a special task force on autism to examine current models of provision in this area and to make recommendations on how such provision can be further improved. The task force, which has been requested to report within three months, will consider the needs of pupils with Asperger's Syndrome.</P>
    <P>I have also announced my intention: to introduce nation-wide pre-school service for all children with autism; to extend the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism; to double the level of special needs assistant cover provided to each special class catering for children with autism, and to provide a programme of specialised teacher training for teacher dealing with children with autism.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing to appoint an internationally recognised expert in the field of autism and a clinical psychologist to collaborate in the development of policy relating to the provision of education services for children with autism.  </P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures currently in place, coupled with the further initiatives which I have recently announced, will result in a significant enhancement of the quality of education service available to the children in question.</P>

      <P>I have recently more than doubled the number of psychologists in my Department's service.</P>
      <P>At present, the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, deploys 70 psychologists in schools around the country. Of these, 25 are based in the region corresponding to that covered by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Twelve of the 25 psychologists also provide a service to schools outside the region and two are job-sharing. The two vocational education committees for the city and county of Dublin also employ six psychologists who are available to schools in that sector.</P>
      <P>Additional psychologists have recently been appointed to NEPS and it is envisaged that, by the end of the current school year, 32 NEPS psychologists will be assigned to the Eastern Regional Health Authority area.</P>
      <P>Psychologists assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. Using this procedure, urgent cases are seen in a comparatively short time. In other, less urgent cases, psychologists advise parents and teachers on appropriate remedial strategies, in the light of schools' assessment results. In such cases some students, parents and teachers can benefit from the psychologist's advice without the need for an individual psychological assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give details of the results in question since a candidate's results in Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG, cannot be disclosed to anyone other than the candidate. The <Col N="1118" /> candidate herself has, of course, received full details of all examinations taken by her to date, with the exception of the latest examination held last month. The results of this examination will be issued to all candidates shortly.</P>
      <P>There are specific guidelines in place for the part of the examination dealing with Múineadh na Gaeilge. Candidates are expected to have knowledge of the teaching methods of Irish as a mother tongue and as a second language to primary school children, and of strategies to promote the use of Irish as a language of communication and as a teaching medium. The standard required to obtain a pass in the SCG is the standard of Irish which would enable teachers to teach the language to sixth class in a national school. Candidates must therefore demonstrate that they have attained the level of language competence described in the syllabus and reflected in the examination papers, and that they understand the methodology of teaching Irish as a second language.</P>
      <P>An examination committee formulates a marking system based on the questions set in the papers for each sitting of the SCG. This marking system is applied rigorously by all examiners in marking the papers, and is also strictly adhered to in the case of re-checks.</P>
      <P>The questions in each paper are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of methodology as set out above, having regard also to the candidate's competence in the language. Based on the information made available to me by my officials, I am satisfied that the marking system is equitable and that it is applied fairly by all examiners.</P>
      <P>Candidates' names do not appear on their examination scripts, which are distributed among examiners on a numerical basis only. It is highly unlikely, therefore, that the same examiner would mark a candidate's papers in different examinations. It is normal, however, for all of a candidate's papers in the one examination to be marked by the same examiner.</P>

      <Quest>the grants which are available to people doing a part-time degree or other educational courses; if he will consider improving these benefits and introduce free fees similar to those given to full-time students as part time students working have made a commitment to the economy and will use their skills to the advantage of society and the economy; and if he will make a statement in relation to the need for greater encouragement and recognition of them.</Quest>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, maintenance grants are tenable in respect of approved full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two year's duration or a full-time postgraduate course of at least one year's duration in an approved institution. There are no plans at present to extend the terms of the student support schemes to include part-time courses.</P>
      <P>The question of introducing free fees for part time students generally, similar to those given to full-time students, could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. However, the White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, indicates that arrangements will be implemented so that higher education fees, in respect of certain courses, will not apply to part time students, who satisfy the residency clause, and who are social welfare means-tested or unemployment payment recipients or dependants, medical card holders or dependants, persons in receipt of family income supplement or dependants.</P>

      <P>Griffith College is a private college and as such the position pertaining to it is that which is applicable to private colleges generally. There are no plans at present to abolish third level fees for students attending private colleges. As the question of the non-inclusion of courses in such colleges within the free fees initiative is currently at issue in the case of Patrick Jordan junior, Patrick Jordan senior, Raymond Kearns and Barry Acton f2&gt;v. the Minister for Education, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any further statement as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards maintenance grants, any extension to the scope of the grants scheme, to include students attending private colleges, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges.</P>
      <P>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax is available on tuition fees paid to certain private colleges in the State, including Griffith College, in respect of approved undergraduate courses. Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from any tax office.</P>
      <P>The student assistance-access fund, previously known as the hardship fund, does not operate in private colleges.</P>
