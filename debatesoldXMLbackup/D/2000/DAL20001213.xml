      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a point at this stage so that I am in order, Sir. Yesterday a request was made by my party to have the opportunity to move in Private Members' time a motion to be taken without debate that would refer particular legislation to the relevant com<Col N="347" /> mittee of this House. The Chair undertook to examine whether such a procedure would be acceptable. I understand it is acceptable to the Opposition party that currently possess Private Members' time and the proposal would be that we would move the motion to be taken without debate. It is a procedural motion simply to refer the legislation to the relevant committee. I wonder if you, Sir, are in a position to indicate if that is permissible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle. My understanding yesterday was that the Chair felt it could be taken in Private Members' time. It is a procedural motion to be taken without debate simply to refer the legislation to the relevant committee. Is the Chair now saying &ndash; I accept your ruling of course&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same subject, my understanding is that the House can make any decision it wishes as to what time any business is taken. I hope the House, through the Taoiseach, will agree to Deputy Quinn's request.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Quinn would agree to leave this matter until tomorrow morning, I will check it during the day. If I understand him correctly he is asking that the motion be moved without debate and allow the committee to be set up.

      <P>The Appropriation Bill concerns the expenditure of vast sums of money, not least of which is the expenditure on education concerning the payment of teachers and the maintenance of the educational system. For the House to rise until 30 January, as the Taoiseach proposes, without debating the crisis in secondary education would be a great dereliction of duty on our part. Can the Taoiseach give an assurance if he is not willing to grant a debate on either the Appropriation Bill or on the issue itself that the Minister for Education and Science will go to the proposed meeting with the ASTI with a concrete proposal to resolve this dispute? In particular will he endorse the Fine Gael proposal for the establishment of a commission on teaching where all the issues affecting the conditions of work of teachers and the improvement of the educational system for the sake of students and parents can be dealt with in a structured way rather than through the confrontation which is causing enormous anxiety to young people and their families? I declare an interest in the sense that one of my own family is directly affected by this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, while the Taoiseach was understandably absent, a question was put to the Minister for Education and Science to the effect that if the Government was to agree to the establishment of a commission on teaching, similar to the commission on the nursing profession, a means could be found within which, without damage to the position on either side, a formula could be arrived at that would resolve this dispute. In the context of what the Leader of the Fine Gael Party has said, has the Government made a decision on the proposal for a commission on teaching?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies Bruton and Quinn said, the Minister for Education and Science is due to meet the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland shortly. That meeting is in the process of being arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the next few days, as soon as it is arranged between the Minister and the leadership of the ASTI. At that meeting all the difficulties that are continuing to arise in this regard will be debated and discussed. I have already said in the House if the teachers' case is that they believe matters have changed, that there are new matters or matters that should be aired <Col N="349" /> they have a process in which to do that as have other teachers, public servants and other sectors. That procedure is set out in an independent benchmarking process. I hope in the discussions with the Minister that they can take that up. Prior to the start of the dispute, the issue was that there was no certainty that anything could be achieved in the monetary sense until the summer of 2002 or later from that process. That stipulation which seemed to be the kernel of the case put forward by the teachers no longer applies since last Monday week when the Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC and the Government formally agreed a new process. The process is that the benchmarking has started and runs up to the summer 2002 and payments can date back to December next year. It also allows people to put their case comprehensively. I am at a loss to know, quite frankly, what this dispute is about when that benchmarking process is available. If there is something else we can usefully do, and the Minister can usefully explain in the deliberations he has entered into, hopefully we can resolve it. The Government will do all it can to avoid the unnecessary disruption to the only people who are really suffering, that is the children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is at a loss to know what this dispute is about then the debate should certainly take place in this House so that he can be informed. He has displayed a total lack of urgency, understanding and sympathy for the dilemma of many parents and their children particularly those sitting the leaving certificate examination. For those reasons, I believe we should have the debate. I oppose the motion not to have a debate on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that the Government's position is that it is not prepared to contemplate, at this stage, the establishment of a commission on teaching. If that is the case, likewise the Labour Party will oppose this motion.</P>

      <P>The Treaty of Nice is of such importance that we deserve a proper debate in the House which would allow all Members who wish to contribute to do so. The issues concerned involve Ireland's likely loss of its Commissioner and its reduction in voting strength in both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers for no apparent gain and for a treaty that may, because of the voting structures involved, make decision making more difficult in the EU, which could prove to be to the detriment of all. In view of this does the Taoiseach agree that a much longer debate on the treaty is required than the very short statements proposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that such a short truncated debate is proposed for the Treaty of Nice given that the purpose of the treaty was to find a way of ensuring that smaller countries and minority voices had an equitable involvement with the larger partners. The proposal for this debate entails the opposite. The large parties will debate the treaty to the exclusion of other parties in the House who are not recognised as a group under Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>I ask you, Sir, to respect the spirit the Treaty of Nice was supposed to fulfil, to give equal and fair opportunity to people to voice their opinion and have their point of view heard. That is not happening in respect of No. 47. I object to the way the debate on the Treaty of Nice is proposed and will vote against the proposal unless the Taoiseach can indicate how it is to be changed to ensure that smaller parties can become involved.</P>

      <P>The House has conventionally debated in the unsatisfactory manner prescribed in the order the report from a council or summit. It means a series of statements are made in the absence of a dialogue. The Minister for Foreign Affairs or his spokesperson reads from a prepared script, anticipating what might be said in advance. It is nonsensical.</P>
      <P>There are two issues involved here. This was an intergovernmental conference as well as a normal summit. It is the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference &ndash; the Treaty of Nice &ndash; that needs comprehensive debate. The prerequisite of such a debate is the text of the treaty. I have not received a full text in the English language. There have been newspaper reports, but the devil is in the detail. Will the Taoiseach undertake to ensure that we have a full, free and open debate in the House on the Treaty of Nice, as distinct from a report on the summit meeting of the Council of Ministers? We cannot have that debate until a published version of the treaty is made available to all Members.</P>

      <P>In reply to questions raised, the report from Nice is the normal report which is available today. Deputy Quinn outlined the Intergovernmental Conference as well as the normal meeting. As the issue was raised several months ago, I saw what happened in relation to Amsterdam when requests were made to hold discussions in advance in the Foreign Affairs committee. Unfortunately, that did not happen but I did not take that view on this occasion. There have been a number of sessions of the Foreign Affairs committee on this issue. Following Biarritz, Deputies Quinn and Bruton asked for a pre &ndash; and post-Nice session in the Foreign Affairs committee, to which I agreed. Before Nice, there was a long and detailed pre-session. I believe Friday has been set for a post-session, but I am open to correction on that. Deputy Quinn suggested that perhaps we should also debate the issue when the full text is available in the new year, to which I agree.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the safety of allowing meningitis vaccinations take place in GPs' surgeries. Is he aware of a report by Dr. Gueret which suggests that only 5% of the surgeries in the eastern region in which these meningitis vaccinations are taking place have the necessary equipment to deal with a situation where a patient has an acute reaction to the vaccine and that most surgeries lack access to oxygen and ventilation equipment and would be unable to put people who may have a reaction on drips? This is suggested to be the tip of the iceberg as far as the under-equipment of GPs' surgeries in the eastern region, and generally, is concerned. Are steps being taken in the light of this alarming report by Dr. Gueret about the safety of meningitis vaccinations, which is published in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Meningitis is a serious disease. I will examine the report. I have no information about it. Because of the high instance of meningitis in our society, the health board, through the substantial resources that have been made available to it in the last few years, has been trying to ensure that all GPs can provide a vaccination service. I assume the study has been done in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. The <Col N="358" /> report will have to be examined. I assume it is factual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Taoiseach a copy of the report which suggests that only 5% of GPs' surgeries are safe for the administration of these vaccinations. Dr. Gueret, who is a member of the ERHA, has called for vaccinations to be stopped. I do not endorse that call because I believe in vaccination but I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that steps are taken by the Minister for Health and Children to deal with this matter. It should not be left on the long finger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On Monday, 4 December, it was reported in the newspapers that the Taoiseach promised to bring forward a package of legislative measures to deal with the issue of ethics in Government and the conduct of politics. The report referred to legislation relating to lobbyists, whistleblowers and the capping of donations. I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that this House passed 18 months ago, on Second Stage, legislation in relation to lobbyists. The House passed legislation in relation to donations which came into effect on 1 December and the Seanad has passed legislation in relation to lobbyists.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that, as we saw yesterday, the Taoiseach has not met his own legislative drafting record and is seriously behind his own timetable, will he recognise that much of what he is proposing has already been drafted and, in the case of the three pieces of legislation I have mentioned, is on Committee Stage. These Bills could be appropriate vehicles for the enactment of measures prior to the next election, assuming the Taoiseach is serious about having them enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's general point about the legislative programme, 13 of the 15 Bills on the list for this session will be circulated as well as two further Bills which were not on the original list.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific legislation referred to, the Government is bringing forward those Bills. I have already acknowledged the input of his party and the Fine Gael Party to the legislation. Because most of this legislation affects Members of the House as well as others, I offered to bring these matters forward on an all-party basis but that offer was declined, particularly by Deputy Quinn. The Government proceeded with the legislation. It will take into account work that has been done by others or Bills that have been before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some legislative areas much work is required. Only a few countries have passed lobbyist legislation and most of those repealed it after a few years. If we are to have lobbyist legislation, which I sincerely wish to see, we must put considerable effort into drafting it. Deputy Quinn has put forward his views on whistleblower legislation. We will bring forward legislation in these areas as soon as it has been drafted. I have out<Col N="359" /> lined the proposals which will be included in that legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are not making sufficient progress with regard to the overall legislative programme, the House has passed the Second Stage of two pieces of legislation, the other House has passed the Second Stage of the lobbyist legislation and there is precedent for a Government having the humility to accept in principle legislation drafted on the other side of the House and amend it as it sees fit. If the House is serious about enacting this legislation within a realistic timetable before the next general election and having it in place, surely a vehicle which is already in the station and ready to travel would be more effective than proposed legislation from the Government, the heads of which have not even been drawn up? Why can the Taoiseach not accept our three Bills, bring them to the two Houses, amend them as he sees fit but get on with the business so that politics is not traduced as it is currently in Dublin Castle by a Member of this House?</P>

      <P>From his exchanges with Deputy Quinn, am I correct in saying the Taoiseach is suggesting the whistleblowers Bill, which his Government accepted in good faith in this House, will not proceed to Committee Stage but will have some of its elements rolled into a multi-purpose Bill which we will see at some stage in the next year? </P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware there are deeply held views on both sides of this debate. This is not a political argument but one about how to find the most desirable way of implementing a regulatory authority.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>By the standards of other times and of other countries of this day, the budget that we have been able to introduce for 2001 is stunning in the breadth and scope of its ambition. Living standards and disposable income will improve significantly for every group. Even former Ministers for Finance, and there are a good few of us in this House, can only rub our eyes in disbelief. Fifteen years ago expectations centred round how many pence the Minister would add to excise duties on petrol, beer and cigarettes. Ten years ago, when the situation had improved somewhat, a good income tax and social welfare package costing around £200 million each was about as much as we could expect. This year we have been able to produce a social welfare package of £850 million or four times the 1997 level, and for the second year running an income tax and PRSI package well over £1 billion. There are, in addition, significant reductions in indirect tax, which lower the CPI by up to half a percentage point.</P>
      <P>The ultra healthy state of the public finances allied to record growth in the economy has enabled the Government to achieve the long desired and elusive goal of full employment, or very close to it, and, having achieved it, to raise living standards substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most significant statements in this regard is to be found in Chapter 2.2. of the Stability Programme published with the budget which reads, &ldquo;Ireland's GNP <i>per capita</i> is currently estimated to be about 100% of the EU average&rdquo;. As we all know, in every case GNP, not GDP, is the relevant measure of living standards. What this means is that, in this year of the millennium, Ireland has caught up with average EU living standards. According to the ESRI, incomes have risen in real terms by a rate of 4.3% a year since 1997 compared with 2.2% over the previous seven years. Real earnings, as well as productivity, have been rising faster than elsewhere. <Col N="365" /> I remember Deputy Quinn in the past being praised as visionary for suggesting that we might reach the EU average income per head by 2005 or 2010&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government we have achieved this long sought after goal today.</P>
      <P>An average is only that. We still have important deficits in infrastructure and social provision, which we are determined to make up. Nevertheless, we have been able to almost double health spending in our term in office, increase child benefit rates by nearly 60% in one year, bring old age contributory pensions well over the £100 mark to £106 per week and direct far greater resources to education. We are also funding a £41 billion national development plan entirely from our resources, apart from an element of Structural and Cohesion funding and some public private partnership projects.</P>
      <P>What has been happening in Ireland in recent years is unique and is of interest to many other counties. I have described it, and the ESRI has described it, as a &ldquo;golden age for the Irish economy&rdquo;. It did not happen by chance. It is very far from being in the natural order of things. One can cite far-sighted decisions from 40 years ago on opening up the economy to trade and investment and providing free secondary education, but the current sustained and extraordinary phase of expansion started in 1994 and has been strengthened and prolonged beyond all expectations since 1997. All of this was built on the decisive turn around in the economy and the adoption of social partnership going back to 1987 and the successful handling of the currency crisis in 1992-93.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is as low as at any time in our history. As the ESRI has reminded us, the lowest unemployment rate previous to this was a rate of 4.6% in 1964 during the Lemass years. Today, our unemployment rate stands at 3.7%. For the first time our unemployment rate is well below Britain's. Some 300,000 net additional jobs have been created under this Government alone and, where employment was only a little over 1 million in 1986, it is expected to reach 1.8 million in 2001 heading towards 2 million over the next few years. There was no need to worry about growth in joblessness once the initial slack had been taken up.</P>
      <P>Unemployment was always regarded as the leading indicator of poverty. Many argued that we would not ever see full employment again. It is now clear that was too much of a defeatist attitude. We have driven down the rate of unemployment from more than 10% three years ago to 3.7% today, and long-term unemployment stands at 1.4% of the labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Commission acknowledged before the budget that Ireland treats the low paid more favourably in the tax code than any other member state. An extraordinary 38% of income ear<Col N="366" /> ners will be exempt from tax from this budget thanks in part to the increase in PAYE allowance to £2,000. We are also very proud in this budget to have reached our promised target of a standard rate of tax of 20%. All but one of the 15 point reductions from the 35% rate in 1988-89 have been carried out by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance, 11 of them with Progressive Democrats support in Government.</P>
    <P>I regard the Fine Gael proposal of an intermediate rate of 33% as a sign of a clear lack of commitment to bring 80% to 85% of taxpayers down to no more than the standard rate of 20%, nearly half of whom will now find themselves below the tax threshold. This Government, not Labour, introduced the national minimum wage. By next year we hope to have brought the tax threshold up to the same level, thus removing those on the minimum wage from the tax net. I recall at the last election that Democratic Left proposed a tax free allowance during the lifetime of this Government of £4,800, or £5,800 including the PAYE allowance. Anyone on PAYE now enjoys a tax allowance of £7,500.</P>
    <P>This Government had a vision of the immense economic opportunities when we came into office three and a half years ago. We calculated that if we could restrain the growth of net current expenditure, at least for a period, to around 4%, which we did between 1997 and 1999, we could put the public finances into growing surplus. Some of the parties opposite do not believe in surpluses, though I have always failed to understand what is socialist or progressive about continued interest payments of £2 billion or more a year <i>ad infinitum </i>to banks, domestic and foreign. A strong financial position, so far from being the enemy of good public finances, is the source of them. Parties opposite freely admit that they have not ever enjoyed the possibilities offered to the Minister for Finance, but politically we have made our luck, first, by going for a surplus and, second, by our policy of radical tax cutting, which, in most instances, has served only to increase the tax revenue available.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has consistently criticised the tax cutting policies of the Government, afraid that it might starve the State of necessary revenue. We have had long experience here of high tax rates and miserable yields. The Minister was bitterly criticised for halving capital gains tax in the 1998 budget, but he has quadrupled the yield from £132 million in 1997 to more than £600 million this year, and a projected £785 million for next year. I am sure the Labour Party's idea of increasing the tax yield would have been to raise the rate from 40% to 50%, which would have had the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Opposition to point out any major tax heading which is other than buoyant, especially those where there have been substantial rate cuts. It is also a universally acknowledged phenomenon that high nominal rates of tax encourage avoidance and evasion and there is a <Col N="367" /> far higher disposition towards compliance where tax rates are set at reasonable levels.</P>
    <P>Left wing commentators tend to moralise about the starving of social services in the 1980s as a result of the activities of Ansbacher account holders and similar. That is a half truth. Social services were starved and the PAYE tax allowance was crucified through bad economic management stemming from even worse ideological instincts.</P>
    <P>Well meaning social democrat minded politicians in the Fine Gael and Labour coalitions of the 1980s decided that raising taxes to record levels, such as a 35% top rate of VAT, a 65% top rate of income tax, not to mention sundry additional levies, was the correct response to a serious financial deficit. That outmoded thinking is still deeply ingrained. The debate is not about levels of spending. Everyone agrees that we are now spending to the limit of our ability to absorb it. The issue is whether we need to go back into deficit, raid funds set aside for future pension liabilities and call a moratorium on tax cuts. Surely this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has demonstrated beyond doubt that we have a far better way to achieve the social ends that we all share. Our tax system is well on the way to becoming completely competitive with other European countries, including our close neighbour, the United Kingdom. In another two or three years, if we maintain course, no one will be able to maintain that higher rates of taxation in Ireland are a deterrent to living or locating here.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the prudence of the budget, given that the economy is operating close to capacity. The Exchequer surplus is set to rise from £2.4 billion this year to £2.5 billion next year, without taking into account receipts from the sale of TSB and ACC, or proceeds from the auction of a third generation of mobile phone licences. We are operating comfortably within the spirit and the letter of the European Stability and Growth Pact. Our creation of a pension fund for the future, which is outside most of these figures, has been applauded by everyone except the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We have set the course for the lowest general Government debt-GNP ratio in the EU, apart from Luxembourg for next year. Only 13 years ago at the end of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition, we were just behind Belgium at the top of the debt league, equivalent to 125% of GNP. Today, we have by far the strongest structural balance in the OECD, and our interest expenditure is set to fall to 1.2% of GDP by 2003, which is the lowest in the EU again except for Luxembourg. Fine Gael's budget proposals added up to at least £1.3 billion for this year. The tax proposals for tax relief and increased spending, only some of which are costs, added up to another £2 billion. No one opposite is in any position seriously to accuse the Government of a lack of financial prudence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> Wise men from abroad might tell us what sort of surplus we should have. A surplus of £5 billion, £6 billion or more. There is no country in the world where there are still pressing needs among the population and where there are deficiencies in infrastructure and social service provision that would run even larger surpluses and fail to address these.</P>
    <P>Economists today belong to two schools of thought, those who encourage us to keep going and those who warn us to slow down. The clear national consensus is to keep going, without abandoning all prudence. As the OECD put it in its Economic Outlook, &ldquo;The Challenge for Policy is to avoid inflationary bottlenecks and prolong the expansion&rdquo;. We are not just on top of the business cycle but we are moving on to an altogether higher plane.</P>
    <P>This will involve clearing bottlenecks and intensifying competition. Housing and transport, which scarcely figured on Fine Gael and Labour's agenda at the last election, are receiving huge resources. The number of local authority housing units will amount to more than 30,000 between 2000 and 2003, an average of more than 7,500 each year, equal to anything sustained in the past. Up to and including the last rainbow coalition budget of 1997, the Exchequer was not investing a single penny of its own, as opposed to existing EU funds, in upgrading our public transport system. That changed, after we came to office. Capital expenditure for public transport by the Exchequer next year amounts to £280 million. We are spending £620 million on national roads next year. This compares to a £232 million provision in the 1997 budget. The rainbow coalition hardly anticipated any of the problems and made no special provision for them.</P>
    <P>If we currently have a problem, it is not a lack of competitiveness but hyper-competitiveness. I am satisfied that with the partnership structure reaffirmed, the falling out of a number of inflationary factors from the CPI, beginning with the excise increase on cigarettes last year, the strengthening of the euro and the levelling off of oil prices, inflation will fall to an estimated average of 4.5% for 2001 from a 5.5% average for 2000 as a whole.</P>
    <P>In addition to fulfilling this Government's programme, this budget will play a key part in underpinning the partnership process. Partnership has been a key factor in the phenomenal success enjoyed by Ireland since 1987. The broad consensus on economic and social policy which has been achieved through the partnership process has created the conditions for consistent and coherent policy responses by Government to the challenges facing Irish society. Partnership, it has been argued, is no longer necessary given the changed nature of the labour market, the workforce, the economy or society. Certain groups have argued that the partnership framework does not enable them to achieve the rewards they regard as their due. <Col N="369" /> I state clearly that partnership has been, is, and will continue to be, a cornerstone of our economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>Those who argue that we can now revert to the free-for-all approach that reigned in this country in the 1970s and 1980s have very short memories. Those of us who remember the depths of economic and social despair that this country plummeted to in the 1980s are only too aware that there is no immutable law that Ireland must prosper. There is no immutable law that there will be employment for our young people. There is no immutable law that we must be able to afford quality health care, education and social services for all.</P>
    <P>The economic and social benefits being delivered by this budget are a direct result of the partnership approach and the willingness of the strong in our society to exercise restraint, both in their own interest and in the interest of the weaker sections of our society. This is why the social partners have made compromises in the recent review of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This is why my Government has turned its face and will continue to turn its face against making special deals for groups outside the partnership process.</P>

      <P>As I said, I know members of the ASTI were extremely pleased last week regarding their major concern, the fact that they saw no possibility in a benchmarking process. Last Monday week when the social partners signed off, it meant that if they got into that process and worked up to 2002 they could receive resources back to next December. Deputy Bruton has probably seen Dr. Woods's statement, where he sets out the beneficial areas for the teachers and members of the ASTI where they can use this system. They normally do a good job and I hope they see the benefits in the process. I thank Deputy Bruton for giving me the opportunity to say so. I am very grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key objectives of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness are to underpin Ireland's competitiveness and develop our economic prosperity. Sustainable economic growth and the achievement of social justice may sound like abstract terms but the reality of achieving them, however, we can see all around us. We can see it in the massive investment in pensions and child benefit. We can see it in the dramatic improvements that are being made in our health and education systems. We can see it in the jobs vacant notices in our newspapers and the small talk of sons taking sabbaticals in Australia and daughters obtaining well paid, high skilled jobs in our thriving economy. We can see it above all in the <Col N="370" /> sense of pride and self-confidence obvious in our young people. This did not happen by accident and only an extreme optimist would believe it will continue in the absence of the broadest possible social agreement.</P>
    <P>This budget will ensure that the Government more than fulfils the tax and expenditure commitments contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In the programme the Government committed itself to ensuring that there would be increases in take-home pay, including pay increases, of up to 25% or more. This budget will ensure that a single person on £18,000 will receive an increase in net take home pay of 13.5% under the first of the three phases of the PPF alone. A married couple with one earner on the same salary will receive a 10% increase. A married couple with two earners earning £30,000 will receive an 11.7% increase. These figures exclude additional payments, such as the 3% early settlers allowance which was paid to a large number of public servants. They also exclude the historically large increases in child benefit.</P>
    <P>The commitment to further tax reform is being met by the completion of the move to tax credits, the widening of the standard rate bands and the alignment of the tax and calendar years. The agreement that over time all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net has been brought forward a very considerable distance. This budget removes 133,000 taxpayers from the tax net completely. The single PAYE worker must now earn £7,500 a year before becoming liable to tax. This is an increase of £1,800, a phenomenal achievement by any standards.</P>
    <P>The agreement that a single standard rate income tax band be established for all taxpayers has been brought a significant distance nearer full implementation. Every single taxpayer will now have a standard band of £20,000. For the first time since the 1970s, workers on the average industrial wage no longer risk being subjected to the higher rate of tax. For the married couple with one earner, there has also been a benefit. Now, no married couple earning less than £29,000 will pay the higher rate of tax. We are now well on the way to achieving the target set out in the programme of 80% of taxpayers paying tax at the standard rate only.</P>
    <P>At the heart of this budget is our continued commitment to the building of an inclusive Ireland, where every person is given the opportunity to play a full role in the economic and social life of our country. Some people find a comforting refuge in the rhetoric of the 1960s but modern Ireland has learnt and benefited from the greatest lesson of recent history &ndash; Governments and parties which adhere to simplistic left or right views of the world will achieve nothing for their people. The Government very firmly believes that economic growth is not an end in itself. It can and must be directed to social ends, with the tackling of exclusion as the key goal. There is far too much <Col N="371" /> of a tendency to see issues of growth and competitiveness on the one hand and fairness and inclusion on the other, as being mutually exclusive. A strong, dynamic economy is an essential foundation for significant social progress. Because of this, we have to make sure that short-term policies do not undermine our ability to build an economy capable of sustaining the level of social supports to which we aspire. At the same time, we have to make sure that we work hard to understand and address the needs of those in our society who may require extra help.</P>
    <P>In area after area, we have been true to this approach. The level of funding we have provided is not only unprecedented, it is making a difference. This has clearly been recognised by both Opposition parties, who have recently moved from accusing us of not spending enough on social supports, to a position where they say that we are just throwing money at problems. It is now very clear that the ongoing and crude effort to portray the Minister for Finance and this Government as being against social spending has not fooled anyone.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Noonan on his very creative approach, saying in the same speech that we are spending too much money on the one hand and that we are not spending enough on the other. That is really good. The recent attempt of the Labour Party to paint this Government as neglecting social problems because we have not met a certain GDP spending benchmark has already fallen flat on its face. Their proposed return to the days of deficits has been widely rejected, as has the idea that the level of social concern in our society can be measured by the size of our taxes and level of our spending. If this were true, everyone would want to return to the mid-1980s, the time when we had our highest taxes and highest levels of spending as a percentage of national wealth. Of course, the public has not fallen for this line. They remember a time of record deficits, record debt, record unemployment, record emigration and a record number of speeches from Deputy Michael D. Higgins passionately denouncing the evils of capitalism. There is no question that we now have a level of resources available to us which allows us to announce the ambitious spending measures outlined by Ministers over the last week but it has not just been an issue of resources. There was no fiscal crisis in 1995, when the decision was taken to limit social welfare increases to inflation and to give most categories of social welfare recipient £1.50 extra per week. Similarly, the resources were there to improve funding for adult literacy programmes and to provide extra housing.</P>
    <P>There is no question that we now have a level of resources available to us which allows us to announce the ambitious spending measures outlined by Ministers over the past week. However, it has not just been an issue of resources. There was no fiscal crisis in 1995, when the decision was <Col N="372" /> taken to limit social welfare increases to inflation and to give most categories of social welfare recipients £1.50 extra per week. Similarly, the resources were there to improve funding for adult literacy programmes and to provide extra housing. Choices were made and issues were ignored. What we have done is not just allocate extra funding, we have also brought long-neglected areas into the centre of public policy.</P>
    <P>There is no magic wand. What the public wants is a Government which recognises the issues that matter and works to address them. They do not expect everything to be perfect, but they do expect commitment, creativity and effort, which they are getting. This is why the increasingly shrill calls of &ldquo;you've never had it so bad&rdquo; are being ignored and why the public have continued to prefer our approach. The budget which we announced last week builds on the social progress of our first three budgets and step-changes policy in a number of crucial areas. The big winners are children, older people and people with disabilities, but the budget will enable progress across the full range of areas involved in building a more inclusive society.</P>
    <P>The £850 million provided for social welfare improvements is over twice the size of any previous social welfare package. With increases ranging from 10 to 18 percentage points, people dependent on social welfare will see significant increases in their incomes next year. We are also honouring our pledge to deliver welfare improvements at the same time as tax changes, bringing greater equity to both. A few weeks ago, I launched this country's first ever national children's strategy. It provides a framework for the next ten years to build an Ireland which listens to, understands and supports all of its children and was widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Minister of State, Deputy Mary Hanafin, has already outlined the many areas under her direct supervision which will see major increases in resources over the next year. I am particularly proud of the emphasis we have placed on vulnerable children. The increase in funding to support foster parents is one element of this. It brings the extra provision to be used by the Department of Health and Children to develop services for children at risk to £33 million. We very much accept the role the State must play in helping parents in the care of their children, and the budget marks a major move forward in this area.</P>
    <P>The historic increases in child benefit represent the most concerted effort in the history of this country to tackle child poverty. We have not forgotten the need to provide more direct support in relation to child care. That is why £104 million will be available next year to provide support to develop and enhance child care countrywide. When we came to office, there was no provision for child care whatsoever. The figure was nil. We have now completed the first step in the development of county by county child care plans which will deliver support into each community. Direct State subvention will go to support provision in <Col N="373" /> our poorest communities, and capital supports will be available to all providers. We are continuing to discuss measures with a view to further action, with a particular emphasis on encouraging employers to play their part.</P>
    <P>Just as this budget represents a major advance for the youngest members of our society, it marks another major advance for older people. A full year ahead of schedule we have met and exceeded our £100 target and helped pensioner couples in particular. The £1.80 increase, which the last Government thought was enough in January 1997, has been replaced by this year's record £10 increase. However, this budget does much more for our older people, helping to lift many more out of poverty. The budget entitles every person over 70 to a medical card and the various social welfare free schemes. The budget also provides £71 million for a major expansion in health services for older people and to improve the quality and accessibility of services. As part of this, the first increase in the nursing home subvention since 1993 will be implemented. The 25% increase will help thousands of families.</P>
    <P>These form part of the nearly £1 billion extra which we will be providing next year for health services. More people will be treated, more services will be developed and more staff will be recruited as a result of this funding. We are also proceeding with a comprehensive programme of modernisation and reform. Finally, we will publish a new health strategy mid-year, which will set out our vision of how we will develop the world-class health system which our people deserve.</P>
    <P>One of the crucial aims we have been working to achieve is to get to a stage where the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities are not seen as just a health concern. Just as for everyone else in society, every element of government and society is relevant to people with disabilities. We have introduced three major pieces of legislation to benefit people with disabilities and have implemented a fundamental change in the delivery and monitoring of State services for people with disabilities. Other parties have talked about mainstreaming; we have delivered it. This budget includes a range of measures to benefit people with disabilities. Employment and mobility supports are being expanded, housing grants are being increased, a new scheme is being introduced and major increases in independent living supports are to be provided. It is in the area of care and support services that the biggest investment is being provided. Last year we announced a multi-annual programme to clear the waiting list for basic care services for people with intellectual disabilities. As a result, £83 million will be provided next year to develop these services. We will also provide £66 million over the next two years for physical and sensory disability services. The £6 million which will be provided for personal assistance services and the doubling of the mobility allowance are particularly important advances. Over the next year, I would like to see the funding for the new national database of <Col N="374" /> needs used to provide us with an agenda of service improvements similar to the one we are implementing for intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>From the first day we took up office we placed a major emphasis on expanding education funding and services. We have published the first ever White Paper on Adult Education, introduced a needs-based system of special education supports, expanded third-level participation by over 10%, reversed the funding neglect of our schools, and put in place the most concerted effort to tackle educational disadvantage in the history of this State. In power, the Opposition chose to cut teacher numbers and freeze school funding. In contrast, in our primary schools for example, we have increased school funding by well over two-thirds and cut class sizes. Over 2,500 teachers are being hired for our schools, and recent figures show that class sizes are at their lowest in the history of Irish education.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague, Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on his fourth budget and look forward to his fifth. I thank all my colleagues in Government. I would like to express my thanks for the close work done on this budget by all the officials involved and by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>This country is making enormous strides. We are staying on course. This moment is a unique opportunity in the life of our nation. There are many who would like to see us fail. However, as this budget proved, we have the means to succeed.</P>

      <P>This is the budget of a Government applying yesterday's ideas to today's problems. The ideas suitable to a society with high unemployment and unused capacity are being applied to a society where there is overheating, widening social inequality, overcrowded infrastructure and a deteriorating quality of life. The budget fails to recognise or tackle the following nine emerging problems: first, the abject failure of vast increases in Government spending to deliver anything but worsening services in infrastructure, public transport, child care, health services and housing; second, the escalation in the level of personal debt of households caused in part by the Government's failure to allow the supply of new housing at a reasonable cost; third, the resultant bubble in house prices which is imprisoning families in an unsustainable lifestyle and fuelling escalating wage claims; fourth, the overheating of the job market, which is creating conditions for a stop-go employment scenario, is drawing young people prematurely out of education and will require immigration levels which may prove infrastructurally and even socially unsustainable; fifth, the individualisation of family life with unknowable long-term economic and social consequences for the next generation; sixth, the high dependence of Ireland on the information technology sector at a time when that <Col N="375" /> sector is beginning to face structural difficulties; seventh, the risk to the Irish economy of its heavy reliance on an overborrowed United States economy; eighth, the exposure to job losses in Ireland following a sudden rise in the euro &ndash; which I believe will occur &ndash; relative to the US dollar; and finally, the potentially enormous cost of the BSE crisis for a country whose huge beef industry has a unique dependence on exports. None of those nine problems is tackled in this budget.</P>
      <P>What should the Government have done in the budget? First, it should have radically overhauled our totally inappropriate planning, compulsory purchase and public tendering procedures which delay infrastructural projects irresponsibly and unnecessarily. Radical reform here could have increased housing supply, improved public transport, and dramatically relieved traffic congestion without the expenditure of any additional money by using the money quickly and more effectively.</P>
      <P>Second, the budget should have taken radical action to encourage savings by recognising that interest income should be subject to income tax only if it is real income, in other words, if the interest rate exceeds the rate of inflation. It should have also negotiated that some of the pay increase people have earned should be paid in the form of savings bonds rather than cash. Third, it should have built shock absorbers into our economy by introducing profit and revenue sharing into private and public wages to ensure the maintenance costs structure adjusts smoothly in the event of a temporary economic downturn. Fourth, the budget should have relieved the housing burden on the present generation of young people by promoting two generation or 60 year mortgages. If necessary, the Government should have offered such mortgages. Fifth, it should have stated and worked out how and where, as a result of the immigration levels its policies will generate, additional immigrants are to be housed. Sixth, the budget should have increased student maintenance grants substantially so that students are not lured out of education prematurely by superficially attractive offers of potentially dead end jobs simply to enable them to pay, as they must, exorbitant rents for accommodation. Seven, the budget should have made a substantial contingency provision for BSE costs. Finally, it should have stated that it would make a better qualify of life for this generation and the next its overall goal rather than job creation alone. In that context, it should have stated that it will no longer discriminate, as it does, against families where one member takes time off work to do unpaid work in the home looking after children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government system is not working. All the services it provides &ndash; roads, buses, hospitals, everything from the registration of births to the issuing of death certificates &ndash; are clogged by delays. If it is run by the Government it is late or delayed. Is it any wonder it cannot provide new services such as child care when the ones it provides are under-performing so badly? In two <Col N="376" /> years' time when people look back at this budget they will say its biggest single mistake was the failure to take any radical action to encourage people to save and that, by failing to do so, the Minister inflated the bubble and built up major economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The problem today is not Government borrowing but private borrowing by individuals and households. For many it is necessitated by the exorbitant cost of setting up home. That is as a result of Government policy failure in planning, water and sewerage, and housing supply. With household income rising so fast, one would have expected household debt to be paid off and the debt ratio to fall, yet debt relative to income is rising fast. People borrowed over £21 billion in the 12 months to June this year. As gross domestic product will be £81 billion, over a quarter of GDP is now represented by borrowing by individuals and households. For the past four years, personal credit has been growing at 20% a year. The Central Bank stated credit grew by 34% in the year to October. Car loans in January this year were up 56% on the year before. Why is that? With inflation running at 7% and deposit interest rates at little over 3%, savers are losing at least 3% per year on deposits. Why should anyone save in those circumstances? With the financial figures it makes apparent sense to borrow and not to save. Look at the results. In 1990, debt was 42% of average household income. In 1997, it was 55%. Now debt is 65% of household income.</P>
    <P>In the few years since Deputies Ahern, Harney and McCreevy took over, people's borrowing has increased much faster than their incomes. It could be said that those borrowing money to invest in houses and the stock market are saving in another form. However, as the advertisements state, prices can go up as well as down and that is true for houses. Who can forget the Eircom share debacle when the Government and Deputy O'Rourke so enthusiastically encouraged a speculative borrowing binge? This personal borrowing and the boom in spending it is financing is inflating demand in the economy and driving up the price of all services &ndash; child care, houses, health care, nursing homes, eating out, drink &ndash; and the extra borrowing is putting more cars on the roads. Because there is insufficient road space this is causing traffic jams.</P>
    <P>By draining employees from the public sector into private employment, this demand is also creating waiting lists, planning delays and queues for every form of public service. All this competitive private borrowing is putting a squeeze on people's quality of life. People have wide consumer choices but no lifestyle choice. They must work to pay their mortgage and service their debts. They must get up early in the morning and drive long distances to work. They must leave family life to the weekends only. Despite all this effort, they are in a very vulnerable position if interest rates rise or asset prices go down. To a great extent, this problem is caused by escalating house prices. They are responsible for the <Col N="377" /> teachers' strike. They are driving wage claims by young people, young teachers, gardaí and civil servants, who cannot afford a house, not even the kind of house their parents could afford in harder times when they were young teachers, gardaí and civil servants. In terms of ability to put a roof over their heads, young people today are worse off than their parents. That is why they are willing to go on strike. House prices are now rising at 17% when they are already beyond the reach of many middle income couples and when prices generally are rising at 7%. The only way to reduce house prices is to increase supply. Three expert reports have been commissioned by the Government but measures to increase the supply of serviced land for housing remain a virtual dead letter.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty continues to penalise the release on to the market of under-used housing in older suburbs. Couples are contracting mortgages that are completely unsustainable if either interest rises further or current growth in income stops. The International Monetary Fund stated earlier this year that while several euro area countries and US regions have sustained property booms in the 1990s without price collapse no property boom has been on a par with Ireland's. In fact, no industrial country in the past 20 years has experienced price increases on the scale of Ireland without suffering a subsequent fall. Mark those words. That report was addressed personally to Deputy McCreevy who paid no attention to it. There is no evidence of it in last week's budget.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile young couples are on a treadmill because national and local government procedures cannot increase the supply of houses fast enough to match the demand the Government's policies are stoking. Soaring house prices now mean that both parents have no option but to work outside the home. They had such an option in the past but not any more. Economic freedom for women is being replaced by the tyranny of the mortgage. Both parents must work &ndash; neither parent can get sick, neither parent can lose his or her job, they cannot spilt up and neither parent can take a few years off to look after the children because the mortgage will not allow them to do so. Young people get sick, people lose their jobs, couples split and children need time &ndash; time which parents do not have any more. Time has been squeezed out of their lives by the tyranny of traffic, the pressure of the mortgage and the tax penalties of individualisation so unnecessarily introduced in the last budget and aggravated in this one. What sort of economic independence is that for women or men? It is economic tyranny, not economic independence.</P>
    <P>Traffic problems mean that both parents leave home earlier and get home later. When the time budget is squeezed, children lose out. The quality of life of children is not improving today. Stress in the lives of children today can be traced back to the spiralling cost of houses and all the constraints that imposes. The cost of houses has meant that increasing the number of people in <Col N="378" /> paid work has been enthroned as the sole national economic and social objective.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum admitted rather weakly I felt in a report published the day before that budget that &ldquo;It is now widely acknowledged that job creation <i>per se</i> is no longer the appropriate overriding objective of national policy. However, it is not clear what strategic objective, if any, should replace it.&rdquo;  That last sentence is an admission of policy making failure. The forum should have come up with a new objective of national economic and social policy if it thinks the existing one is &ldquo;no longer appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The truth is that thinking cannot keep up with reality in Ireland today. The pace of change is such that we are suffering future shock &ndash; future shock that has affected our ability to think things through fully.</P>
    <P>The stimulation of the economy is creating paid jobs that simply cannot be filled. The proportion of unfilled jobs and jobs not capable of being filled has more than trebled from 2% to 6.5% in three years. The National Competitiveness Council says that &ldquo;pervasive skill and labour shortages are increasing the risk of overheating and of a much sharper than necessary economic slowdown&rdquo;. It is these stimulated labour shortages that are slowing down infrastructural developments, driving up house prices and creating queues in hospitals, queues for child care and queues to get on a bus.</P>
    <P>The ESRI had estimated prior to the budget that the economy was going to grow by 5.1% per year in the period 2000-05 and that employment was going to grow by 2.1% as a result. That was manageable. Five years from now on that prediction, 176,000 more people would be working here than now. However, by putting his foot on the accelerator, the Minister for Finance is now seeking to increase labour shortages. For every 1% that is now added to growth, 92,000 more jobs will be created here and will have to be filled. From where will the people come? </P>
    <P>How many more married women or retired people are there who can be conscripted into the work force. Not many I suggest, given the increased hassle involved in getting to and from work unless, of course, individualisation of allowances and other bands and other tax penalties are so intensified that it becomes financially impossible not to go out to work if one is over 15 years of age or under 85 years of age. That may be where Government policy will eventually lead.</P>
    <P>Will immigration solve the labour shortage? The Government has already estimated that gross immigration to Ireland will have to be 336,000 people between now and 2006 &ndash; 336,000 more immigrants between now and 2006 on the basis of a 5.1% growth rate. The Minister for Finance in this year's budget is now going for an 11% growth rate &ndash; twice that. That growth would, if sustained, require far higher levels of immi<Col N="379" /> gration. Where will all the immigrants be housed if we cannot even house our own people?</P>
    <P>If we were to add say 2% to the projected 5.1% growth rate by stimulatory economic policies of the kind lauded by the Taoiseach in his speech and practised in this budget, that would add 184,000 to the number of jobs, all of which would have to be filled by immigrants. That would bring gross additional immigration to Ireland by 2006 to more than 0.5 million instead of the 336,000 derived from pre-budget estimates.</P>
    <P>One has to question our country's ability to absorb that level of immigration without social and political tensions. This is not an easy issue to raise and one is liable to be misconstrued. Ireland should have more immigration. Immigration enriches the country culturally as well as economically but I believe societies are like people &ndash; they can absorb change but they cannot absorb shocks.</P>
    <P>We must allow immigration to grow naturally rather than be driven forward by economic forces artificially stimulated by Government that are so rapid and so vigorous that they make cultural acclimatisation impossible. A country or a locality with a strong social fabric welcomes new arrivals. A country or a locality with a weak social fabric does not. A country or a locality will accept radical change without reaction so long as the change is gradual and people see the benefits coming from it.</P>
    <P>I do not believe everybody in Ireland today sees the benefit of immigration equally clearly or as clearly as I see it. Better off people can see the benefit, they can see the possibility through immigration of buying labour services more readily. Less well off people see fewer benefits for themselves from immigration. As the income gap is deliberately widened between rich and poor so too is the gap in perceptions of immigration between two sections of the people.</P>
    <P>Unless the housing shortage affecting lower income groups is solved very quickly, I can see major problems arising from the competition between native born and immigrant for scarce accommodation. That would be bad for social cohesion in Ireland. It will undermine the social fabric of our country. Unless we solve the housing crisis, present economic policies are completely unsustainable.</P>
    <P>Labour shortages also mean that young people are losing out educationally. Third year students are being recruited out of universities without completing their degrees by greedy employers. Rents are now so high that paid work is dominating over studies in many of our colleges. Second level students are taking up full time jobs rather than completing their leaving certificate. These young people might ultimately prove to be the most deceived victims of the Ahern-McCreevy boom.</P>
    <P>Strengthening the social fabric of Ireland, creating a sense of community and improving the quality of the lives of this and future generations should be the overriding objective of national policy. It is from that standpoint that I criticise <Col N="380" /> the income tax provisions of the budget, particularly the further steps towards individualisation of income tax.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government clearly believes that the individual, not the family, should be the unit of taxation. I disagree. For tax purposes, children do not exist. The only people recognised now by the tax code are adults and if present individualisation trends continue, soon the only adults recognised by the tax code will be adults in paid employment. Individualisation can, in some senses, be seen as the logical follow up to the abolition of child tax allowances and the freezing of dependant relatives allowance at a mere £220 per year. The dependant relative allowance under the tax code is worth 85p per week to somebody who supports a dependent relative. Let us analyse where this individualisation tax policy is leading.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister for Finance claims, it is right to say that a married couple should not be free to transfer their standard rate band between them, then surely it would also be right in principle to prevent them transferring their personal allowances. There is no logical distinction. That is where individualisation leads. That is what it means. This is wrong and the family, not the individual, should be the preferred unit of taxation. There should be horizontal equity between families at the same income level. I say this because I believe unpaid work within families is not negligible and it should not be discouraged by progressively individualising the tax code as was done last year and this year.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy is being Americanised. Whatever happened in America yesterday will happen in Ireland tomorrow, only at a faster pace because the Irish economy is growing much faster than the American economy grew in the past 30 years. The Council of Economic Advisers of President Clinton has recently analysed the impact on families of changes in the structure of the American economy. Last year it published Families in the Labour Market 1969-1999 analysing the time crunch. This year it published Teenagers and their Parents in the 21st Century &ndash; an examination of the trends in teenage behaviour and the role of parental involvement. These two reports give some insight into the negative social impact of the sort of trends this budget is seeking to encourage. It also gives an insight into the value of unpaid work within families for which this Government has such little regard. If figures were collected in Ireland, they would tell the same story as President Clinton's two reports do about America, only it would be a story at a much faster pace, because we are fast-forwarding trends that took them 30 years to develop.</P>
    <P>From 1969 to 1996 American families saw a 22 hours per week cut in the time available for parents at home with their children. This time crunch fell most heavily on women who have had their time budget severely reduced. Work and commuting time have expanded and they have been forced either to cut back on free time for them<Col N="381" /> selves or on time with their children. The potential consequence of the loss of these 22 hours per week for parental time was analysed in the second of President Clinton's reports. That study measured parental involvement with teenagers on two basics &ndash; subjective, where the teenagers said they felt close to their parents and, objective, where the teenagers ate a meal with either parent more than five times a week. The statistical record comparing those who did and those who did not show more or less the same trend for both. They showed that teenagers who had more time with their parents and who were close to them were: three times less likely to have suicidal thoughts and half as likely to attempt suicide; half as likely to use marijuana between the ages of 15 and 16; half as likely to engage in under age drinking; and significantly less likely to be involved in violent incidents or to smoke cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I believe every one of those findings would be true of Ireland today. These findings demonstrate that it is wrong for the Government to pursue policies which penalise parents who reduce the time they spend at home with their families in order to work longer hours to contribute to the GDP or to pay a mortgage forced upon them by the Government's mismanagement of the housing market. The Taoiseach should reflect on the importance of the figures I have quoted because there is a tendency in the Department of Finance and everywhere to say that things you cannot count do not count. If there are not any figures on the importance of parental time spent at home it does not exist, it has no importance because you cannot count it. President Clinton's economic advisers have put figures on that and I have put those figures on the record. I hope people will pay some attention before they proceed with the destructive policy of individualising the tax code in a way that will drive children away from their parents and drive parents out of the home.</P>
    <P>Parents in Ireland today are being forced to choose between time for children and time for themselves. That is not fair. The Irish housing market also forces them to live further away from their own parents and also from their extended families. They have no supports. They have less time for unpaid work with voluntary organisations. Their lives are being individualised just as their taxes are and they are losing out. They are in an even more vulnerable position if they lose their jobs, as the workers in Mororola did on budget day. Ireland has put a great number of its eggs in the information technology basket. Motorola is not the only story.</P>
    <P>A week before the budget, Gateway Computers shocked investors when it said that revenues during the fourth quarter, traditionally the busiest of the year, would be flat compared with 1999. The group's shares immediately fell by 35% dragging down the shares of IBM, Compaq and Dell. The price of memory chips has fallen by half in the past three months. Intel has recently warned that fourth quarter sales will miss the <Col N="382" /> forecast because of large cancellations by customers worldwide. Other personal computer manufacturers such as Dell, Apple and Gateway have also warned of slowing growth in sales. The problem is that computers are getting faster and faster but the basic broadband telecommunications network is not keeping pace. Most Americans who want a computer already have one. They will not buy an upgrade because they cannot use them given that the phone lines are not up to it.</P>
    <P>To the extent that people in Ireland today are taking out personal loans on the basis of the perceived strength of the IT sector they are leaning on a weakening reed. There are other worries on the horizon. Some 18% of Irish exports go to the United States, soon they will overtake our exports to the UK. Given that the American economy is grossly over borrowed and depends on the savings of the entire world to sustain its stock market what happens if the other parts of the world start to do better and the people want their money back? Where will Irish exports to the US go? We have been told in the past that we were over dependent on the British market, we are now over dependent on the American market. We were told in the past we were over dependent on agriculture, we are now over dependent on IT but the Government does not see that.</P>

      <P>There is another problem imminently facing the Government and the country, the BSE crisis. BSE cost Britain £3.4 billion. It has a cattle herd of 11.4 million. We have a cattle herd of 7.5 million. If we have to pay the same amount as the British had to pay where will it be found? The British were able to get 40% of their £3.4 billion from the EU, we will not because the Taoiseach at the summit in Berlin agreed on the CAP. The money will not be available for us. What happens if we have to have a clearance of our herd? That has not been provided for in the budget.</P>
      <P>This is a budget without any underlying social philosophy, it waves money in front of people but makes no effort to see what has already gone wrong socially or to see what could all too easily go wrong economically. It is a budget for the next few months, it is not a plan for the nation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for announcing the commencement of the general election campaign. There is no other way that one could interpret his intemperate political speech, masquerading as a budget contribution, other than to so do. I am saddened but not surprised that he took the line he did in his comments &ndash; perhaps it was the assistance of new scriptwriters. There are some Deputies here who remember 1977 and the landslide victory which brought the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="383" /> McCreevy and many others into this House, including myself. I was going against the tide on that occasion. The extraordinary ability which the Fianna Fáil Party has and which the Taoiseach put on the record to rewrite history in a false, dishonest and disreputable way never ceases to amaze me. All our problems started in the 1980s and they all started to be resolved in 1987. Fianna Fáil is very good at rewriting history. Stalinism was alive and well in the marbled halls of Iveagh House in 1966 when &ldquo;facts&rdquo; about Ireland gave us a unitary state brought about by a unitary party, without reference to people from the other side in the civil war or the Labour Party. It will come as a surprise to some of the younger Members that on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 insurrection, the leaders of the Labour Party and Fine Gael refused to participate in the outrageous distortion by Fianna Fáil of history that took place at that time.</P>
      <P>I would have thought the Taoiseach, at least, had gone beyond that level of misrepresentation. I am saddened by that. Throughout the political observations in his speech there were misrepresentations, innuendoes and gross distortions of positions which he knows are simply not true.</P>

      <P>I can only conclude that they were there for the purposes of teeing up for a general election. If so, we will be ready for that.</P>
      <P>In so far as this year's budget seems to have won the approval of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's, backbenchers, we have certainly made progress from where we were at this stage last year. However, that does not mean this is a good budget. The opposite is the case &ndash; it is, in fact, a very bad budget.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the budget says a lot about us as a society. The manner in which the proceeds of the infamous Celtic tiger are being distributed is an increasing source of concern. I know it is a cliché, but it must be said again &ndash; an historic opportunity is being wasted.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, spent £4,000 million on budget day alone. In that context, nobody could lose, in absolute terms at least. However, we are entitled to expect a bit more than that. We are entitled to expect that a conscious effort would be made to undo the injustice of last year's budget. As CORI, St. Vincent de Paul and others will testify, no such effort was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened in recent days, including this morning, to some commentators and Fianna Fáil spokespersons seeking to compare their generosity with rainbow coalition budgets. It is disturbing that such facile arguments are given any currency or credibility. In terms of resources, 2001 is as far away from 1997 as 1990 was. The comparisons are simply ludicrous. A former Minister for Finance, <Col N="384" /> who is now Taoiseach, knows that more than most.</P>
    <P>It might be more apposite to look at the politics of 1997. My final budget of that year was met with derision, most of it incoherent, by the current Minister for Finance and the Attorney General. We were told by them that it was inflationary and too expansionist. They criticised the spending record of the rainbow Government incessantly. They said it was an election budget. That they have produced this budget this year, makes a laughing stock of both of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address the issue of inflation. In July 1997, when the current Minister for Finance took office, inflation was at 1.5%. It now stands on the brink of 7%. By that benchmark alone, the Minister has failed miserably. The current Taoiseach said in his 1994 budget speech that high inflation was the enemy of the poor; perhaps, that is why the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is so indifferent to it.</P>
      <P>It is true that, in part, much of our high inflation has been generated by external factors. However, the Minister has also been responsible for some of it. We know about the name calling and arrogance of earlier this year and I will not repeat those charges here. However, this economy has been, as Deputy Bruton said, primed to the hilt. We also know that its primary beneficiaries have been the better off.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder that credit has expanded as it has, on an expectation of large tax cuts every year? Is it any wonder that house prices have spiralled out of control, notwithstanding the three Bacon reports, prompted by investors grown rich on the Minister's largesse? For someone earning £40,000, this year's tax package is enough to finance the purchase of a small car. The real question, that has already been posed by Deputy Bruton, is how long it can last.</P>
      <P>Great play has been made in recent days about the Minister's gambling instincts. That is a fair point to make. The real loser in this budget has been the Department of Finance. I doubt the so-called mandarins in the Department of Finance approved this package. Many will have said this, in itself, is a good thing, but I wonder about that. I also wonder whether similar advice was proffered to George Colley in 1978 and was similarly ignored. All our lives have been different as a result.</P>
      <P>The size of the tax package announced on budget day tells its own story. Before the anarchy commenced last year, with a backdrop of inflation between 2% and 3%, the Minister announced £942 million in tax reductions. This year, with inflation close to 7%, the size of the tax reduction package is £1,232 million &ndash; almost one third higher. It does not take a genius or a dismal scientist to work out the massive contradiction here. Our economy is being run on a wing and a prayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> As a citizen of this republic, I wish the Minister well. I hope the inflation target of 4.5% for 2001, announced in the budget, can be achieved. However, it is ominous that this figure is close to the one predicted by the Central Bank for 2001. That figure was predicted before an additional £4,000 million was injected into the economy on budget day. If the target is not achieved, there will be a number of obvious consequences.</P>
    <P>First, and most importantly, those dependent on social welfare for their income will lose out. Over the past year they have been denied any increased share in our new found spoils. It is distinctly possible that they will lose out again. The Government has made no effort to address that issue.</P>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy McDowell, has made a commitment to many of those people, which I wish to repeat. The Labour Party believes that all social welfare pensions should have been increased to £120 per week in this budget. Furthermore, we are determined to backdate the difference between what was awarded by the Government and our chosen £120 rate from 1 January 2001 if we are in office after the next election.</P>
    <P>I have said on more than one occasion that my party's participation in any Government after the next election will be determined by the policies undertaken by that Government. For those who may be interested, let me state categorically that this policy, to be funded out of the DIRT revenue, is a bottom line one for us.</P>
    <P>Second, if inflation runs over 4.5% a serious blow will be dealt to social partnership. The Labour Party supports social partnership. Let us be honest about this. I can only assume, after last year's experience and the level of negotiations that took place prior to this year's budget, that the 4.5% figure is something that everybody has bought into. I would be surprised if those who criticise the Department of Finance for under guessing inflation in 2000 were prepared to rely on it alone for advice this year. If, therefore, the target of 4.5% is missed, we will all be in a serious position.</P>
    <P>This budget is as much about the failed attempt to appoint Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank as it is about our economy. It is a quick fix budget and, as I said in my opening remarks, an election budget. It is certainly a budget without a long-term strategy. I have already pointed to the risk being taken with inflation and the pooling of that risk with the social partners, or at least some of them.</P>
    <P>Even on the tax side, so beloved of the Government, it is also difficult to see a long-term strategy. On the question of individualisation, it is amazing how selective leaking in advance of the budget can dictate the budget story line. The emphasis on child benefit this year, welcome as it is, was clearly designed to distract attention from the thorny issue of individualisation. As such, and despite the fact that the word has hardly been mentioned, individualisation has continued and <Col N="386" /> has been accelerated. Phase two, announced by the Minister last year, has been carried through and by increasing the PAYE allowance more substantially than the personal allowance, a form of individualisation has been introduced to the tax credit. As my colleague, Deputy McDowell, put it, we now have individualisation for the less well off as opposed to last year's individualisation for the better off.</P>
    <P>A number of consequences arise from this. The first is the extent of discrimination against single income families. The Government has decided that they should have no share in the tax concessions due to workers. Regardless of income or hardship, the Government has decided they should not be invited to the party, while two income earning families are, regardless of income levels.</P>
    <P>Ironically, despite spending most of my political life accused of being anti-family because of my support for the right to remarry, for proper sex education and for the right to proper access to family planning services, I find myself allied today to the pro-family camp. As defined by the Minister, individualisation is a response to a type of society that no longer exists. I do not believe young women or men need any encouragement to return to or participate in the workforce after caring for children at home. In fact, most young couples are crippled by mortgages that would require both of them to work for the rest of their lives outside the home. Our workforce participation rates for women under the age of 40 are at above average levels in European countries.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister chose not to use the word individualisation. He is probably right. I have always had difficulties with the term. If something is individualised surely it means everybody is entitled as individuals to enjoy it. One of the ultimate indications of ownership is the right of transfer to somebody else. What is happening here is the end of transferability, not individualisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At its heart this is a child care issue with one parent, usually the woman, choosing to stay at home to rear the children. The Minister has withdrawn existing support for this type of child care. His view, shared by many, is that labour market needs are greater than those of the children involved. As one commentator put it at the weekend, it is a view of society that puts the child last and the economy first. Strangely, the recent labour force survey shows a slowing down in labour market growth. If individualisation is about forcing older women back to work it is not working. For many of these women, because of the wages they could expect to earn in the market place, the Minister's individualisation programme has no relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the heart of the Minister's approach is disdain for one income families. Many neo-liberals of the economic kind, of which the Minister is <Col N="387" /> one, associate the idea of women working in the home with the oppression of women and the sacrifices they had been forced to make in a male dominated society. I shared some of those prejudices. Working outside the home was an opportunity denied to too many women of my age as a result of social conditions. Many of these women &ndash; I refer especially to the Civil Service marriage bar &ndash; have been denied the opportunity to contribute to public life. Only now as a society do we realise the dynamism we missed. Many of these women rightly feel they have been given a double whammy by the Government &ndash; forced out of the workplace by either social convention or directly by the State and now denied a share in our new found wealth as a result.</P>
    <P>Thankfully things have changed. Young women are no longer being denied the opportunities they once were. They participate in the economy. The effect of the Minister's policy on them will depend solely on their income levels combined with those of their partners. If they are already reasonably comfortable they win, but if they are hard pressed to make ends meet they will lose.</P>
    <P>This gives rise to the question, who or what is the impetus behind the Minister's policy? It is about manipulating the figures to say that only 20% of taxpayers pay tax at the marginal rate. To achieve this goal the Minister has been obliged to write out of the picture a swathe of people. As a result, individualisation is about awarding tax reliefs to the best off members of society.</P>
    <P>It also has a knock-on effect. It will actively discourage one parent taking time out from work to look after the children. Why are we actively discouraging this child care option? I am fortunate to be in a position where my wife looks after my son and I know the advantages it brings both to the child and the parents. It is not unreasonable or illiberal to encourage this option for the early stages of a child's life. How many young couple's lives are being destroyed by the time taken to secure appropriate child care arrangements, driving to and from child care facilities in this city's traffic morning and evening in addition to driving to and from work and putting a child to sleep as soon as they reach home? It is not a desirable lifestyle, but it is the only option available to a large number of people in Ireland today. The Minister's job is to maximise the choices available to these young couples. Instead, he is removing that choice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that facilitating choice will deny the labour market a worker in perpetuity. That seems to be the Minister's only concern. Even in young single income families the natural choice for young families nowadays is for the partner who looks after the children to return to work when they reach school going age. Social convention works in this direction rather than <Col N="388" /> against it, as was the case 30 years ago. I regard this as progress, but I do not regard it as progress to seek to curtail these choices. If that is liberalism it is profoundly misplaced.</P>
      <P>How far does the Government intend to take individualisation? Will it be extended fully into the tax credit as well as the size of the bands? Is it a point of principle for the Government? If it does not complete its project will it have the honesty to campaign on it in the next election, which has commenced today? The people have a right to know. It is not as if the Government has seriously addressed the issue of child care for working parents. As it closes down one option it has been pitifully slow in opening up others. The increase in child benefits is welcome and should go a long way to addressing the appalling level of child poverty, but it does not even begin to address the issue of child care.</P>
      <P>The problem with child care is primarily a supply side one. Costs are escalating out of control because demand far outpaces supply. If additional supply is not generated individualisation and child benefit increases will only serve to stimulate demand and an already rampant child care inflation. There are already signs that the increases in child benefit will only serve to increase prices. The same would probably apply to tax relief also. This is as clear an issue of market failure as I have seen in my political career. Despite this, the ideological disposition of the Government is to rule out active engagement in any form. That is wrong. The State should tackle the provision and co-ordination of child care.</P>
      <P>Our education system is based on public and private co-operation but with the State directing policy and delivering adequate resources. I put it to the Taoiseach and to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, that the same must now apply to child care. However, if the Government's logic, as we understand it, is followed through, it has no intention of dealing with the child care issue. Having withdrawn support for child care in the home through individualisation, why would it support child care outside the home in any sustainable fashion? One will not get any Minister to say so, but that is the logic of the Government's position.</P>
      <P>The Government has a difficulty with being honest. Over four budgets we have seen resources redistributed towards the better off. We have seen massive reductions in all forms of capital taxation and continuing socialisation of business costs, despite the ongoing significant reductions in corporation tax. I have no doubt the Government will be allowed by many in the media to portray itself as being concerned about social inclusion. To do so, it will point to the few crumbs which have fallen from the rich man's table over the past four years and claim they represent the Government's genuine concern. That concern is a myth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is instructive to look at the tax package in this budget to see where the Government's priori<Col N="389" /> ties lie. Only two measures announced impact on low and middle income earners. They are the increase in the allowances and the reduction in the standard rate of tax. Taken together, they amount to approximately £700 million of the Government's £1,250 million package or just over half the tax package announced on budget day. When one considers that those on higher incomes also benefit from these measures, it is not unreasonable to assume that up to two thirds of the budget day tax package is directed at the better off in our society. It is a staggering indictment of the Government and its priorities, particularly in a budget which we were promised would address the inequities of last year.</P>
    <P>On tax alone, for half the money involved the Government could have got an equivalent bang for its buck for low and middle income earners at least. This is what the Labour Party recommended. Our policy on taxation has been subject to gross distortion in recent weeks and hours in this House by Fianna Fáil spokespersons. I suspect we are beginning to see the start of a new red scare by Fianna Fáil whenever it is in electoral difficulties. However, the reality is different. We argued then and we are right now that low paid taxpayers should do better out of our proposals than anything produced by the Government. Our proposals would have done better if they had been implemented. Our relative modesty on taxation allowed us to call for a £14 increase in social welfare rates compared to £8 in the budget and a £24 increase for pensioners compared to the £10 increase announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>This package would have won more favour in the public mind, particularly among those who benefit from the Minister's proposals but who realise deep down that their need is not as great as others. However, the Tánaiste is clearly not one of those people. She remains obsessed with tax rates. She calls rate reduction tax reform. It is no wonder since rate reductions benefit her supporters disproportionately. I wonder how far she wants to go with this. How far does the Taoiseach want to take it? </P>
    <P>What will be their platform in the next election? The Labour Party's priority is clear. We will shift priorities away from reducing taxes to increasing investment which is still, even after this year's Estimates, among the lowest in Europe. On what grounds will the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste fight the election? Will they be honest and campaign on completing their individualisation project and admit their discrimination against one income families? What will they say about taxes? The Tánaiste may have fallen out with the Attorney General but we know her loss is the Taoiseach's gain. What chance is there of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance calling for tax rates of 16% and 33% in the next campaign, plus the united Ireland so beloved of the Attorney General? </P>

      <P>Will they change their course? Having done the bidding of the Progressive Democrats and the Minister for Finance for the past five years, will the Taoiseach seek to resurrect Fianna Fáil's now defunct social conscience? Anything is possible but I am sure of one thing &ndash; circumstances allowing, this election will be sooner rather than later. This speech was written before I heard the Taoiseach's speech. This budget is so full of contradictions it will be difficult to follow. This budget is without a tomorrow. The date of the next election will be determined by the rate of inflation just as this budget has been determined by the rate of inflation and an attempt to buy back the support lost over the O'Flaherty debacle.</P>
      <P>Whenever it comes, the next election will offer the people the most clear cut choice about what type of society they wish to create. They can choose either real social inclusion and investment in people and public services, a choice that will prepare us best for the economic challenges of the information society, or they can choose the doggy dog model where growing inequality is matched by fear and greed and where society is smugly content with the success of the past decade rather than with the challenges of the next. Or is it, as the Tánaiste put it, a choice between American liberalism and European social democracy? </P>

      <P>The economy has been powering ahead under this Administration with growth rates in excess of 9% over the past three years. Sustained growth is now giving rise to bottlenecks and shortages of one type or another in the economy. The budget contains a number of measures designed to ease these pressures.</P>
      <P>Employment is likely to expand at an average rate of 2.5% over each of the next three years. Unemployment has little room to further decrease as we have now reached full employment due to the success of the Government's many training and back to work initiatives. That we must issue work permits to non-EU nationals to solve the labour shortage in many sectors is testimony to the run away success of our economy. Permits are being issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment at a rate of more than 15,000 per annum and this is continuing to rise. We now have only limited scope to increase our domestic labour supply despite the various taxation and training inducements to make it attractive for anyone who wishes to return to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget, together with international trends in currencies and oil prices, will contribute to a gradual but steady reduction in inflation to an estimated 2.5% in 2003. This will also take some of the pressure for high wage increases out of the economy. Some economists and economic commentators have criticised the budget for what they claim are inflationary effects due to the fact that people have more money in their pockets through direct and indirect tax cuts and generous <Col N="391" /> social welfare increases. That is daft. The major determinant of inflation in our economy is external and there is little the Government can do to influence it through fiscal or other policies. The potential inflationary effects of our domestic actions are small in comparison. It is the pragmatic recognition of this fundamental reality that has informed the Minister's budget.</P>
    <P>These commentators believe it is wrong for the Government to return money to the taxpayers rather than to retain it in the Exchequer, thereby increasing surpluses which have no parallel in our economic history. Most of these negative commentators are the people who failed to predict the current boom, yet they are now preaching doom and gloom. Their track record indicates why we should not heed them now.</P>

      <Quest>if, following on from his reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 1 and 2 of 29 November 2000, he will consider re-establishing the sub-committee of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to allow it complete its work.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28718/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>In a previous reply on this issue on 11 April, I indicated that, in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government would envisage that the role played by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation would be discharged by the joint parliamentary forum and North-South consultative forum, envisaged in paragraphs 18 and 19 of strand two of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>At the plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on 26 September last, it was agreed to initiate a study on the establishment of an independent North-South consultative forum; that the study would be taken forward by a working group comprising officials of both Administrations and the joint North-South Secretariat; and that the working group would report to the plenary meeting of the council in March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a joint parliamentary forum is a matter for the two Legislatures to decide upon. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, wrote to the Ceann Comhairle earl<Col N="392" /> ier in the year to express the Government's encouragement and support for the establishment of such a forum. I understand that proposals are currently being formulated and these will be brought to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in due course.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the sub-committee of the forum on obstacles to reconciliation in the South being enabled to complete its work, I have an open attitude, though any consideration will obviously need to take into account the envisaged developments I have set out, as well as the general and ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I will take an early opportunity to raise the matter with the chairperson with a view to establishing what is the preponderant view among the participating parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Would he not agree that it is sensible and wise that work which was initiated by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation should be completed before any decision is taken about long-term future plans for the forum and that this work should be completed as soon as possible? Does the Taoiseach believe it sensible to reconvene a meeting of the forum as a means of bringing together all pro-Agreement parties and groups who want to see the Agreement implemented in full? Does he agree that the forum has proved in the past to be a useful means of allowing pro-Agreement parties to express their views at very difficult periods in the peace process? I am sure he will agree we have entered such a period and that reconvening the forum would not be a hindrance to the current dialogue but would actually provide the Government, the British Administration and the parties in Northern Ireland with a means to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the forum reconvening to finalise some of its work. I researched this matter last week and I discovered that the forum's report was last worked on in February 1996, by which time matters had reached a fairly advanced stage. If we were meeting to dealt with that particular report, there is a question of whether we would be obliged to begin our work again or whether it is relevant in view of the many changes that have occurred. It is the view of some of those involved that we could not finalise the report as it stands because so much has happened in the interim. If the parties believed the forum could make a useful contribution by meeting, I would have no problem in that regard.</P>
      <P>Last year and early this year, when some difficulties arose, Deputy Quinn raised with me on a number of occasions the question of whether we should meet to try to assist the process. At that stage the preponderant view was that matters had moved on and the Northern parties wanted to continue to focus on the negotiations in which they were involved and to allow the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> The situation in the North has changed dramatically from that which obtained when the forum used to meet virtually every Friday. For example, most of the institutions are already in place. While there is a difficulty with a particular party in one of the institutions, the parties can use the other institutions to further their aims. Matters have moved forward in a way that has proven useful and beneficial.</P>
    <P>I have never believed, however, that we had concluded the work of the forum and I will contact the chairperson of the forum in that regard. I had hoped to do so in recent days but the opportunity did not arise. I give a commitment to contact the chairperson as soon as possible. I have no difficulty in finalising the work of the forum, regardless of the stage it has reached, because it might prove useful to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give greater priority to making contact with the chairperson of the forum, particularly in view of this indication that he discussed this matter in April and that it was discussed in the House on 9 November?</P>
      <P>He alluded to the fact that he would consult with the chairperson. Will the Taoiseach do that in the near future, or will we have to ask another question before progress is made?</P>
      <P>This request from Deputy Hayes and me is not a request for the whole forum to be reconstituted, bringing in the leadership of the various parties and the structures involved initially. It is simply a request for the reconstitution of the sub-committee. From its work, which has yet to be completed, we can evaluate the merits of going further with the forum. No civic forum is envisaged on this side of the Border. I do not accept that the PPF is a civic forum in the same sense as the northern civic forum. Does the Taoiseach accept that the forum presents an opportunity to give voice to civic society so that the report on obstacles to progress can be concluded? We would then have something to show for the considerable work which has already gone into the work of the sub-committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the comments the Taoiseach has made, does he agree that the report could be published in its present form as work in progress? If the group to which Deputy Sargent referred is brought together and if its members decide they can not go further, given the nature of the matter to which the report was central, its publication could be a useful contribution. We could be in difficult times in the new year after the next meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council.</P>

      <P>There is merit in what Deputy Quinn has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Sargent's question, perhaps I should not have mentioned April, which is the last time we did a check around. It was only when Deputy Hayes raised the matter during <Col N="394" /> question time a fortnight ago that I said I would talk to the chairperson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I also asked a question then.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent also asked a question. I intended to talk to the chairperson and I will do so in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Much good work was done by the sub-committee on obstacles to reconciliation. The work was quite near to completion although things have moved on since then. I will put it to the chairperson that it is the wish of the House to look at the work achieved by the sub-committee and try to finalise it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>When the sub-committee's report on obstacles to reconciliation in the South has been published, what is his view concerning the long-term prospects for the forum? The forum was established as a result of the Downing Street declaration, negotiated by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. Is it the Taoiseach's view that when the outstanding matters have been published by the forum it should be brought to an end and its work concluded or should it remain in political limbo and await the next crisis when it may be reconvened and be of use to the process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If matters progress positively and the institutions are established, there will be no need for the forum. The forum was an effort, under the Downing Street declaration and the discussions which emanated from it, to bring as many of the parties as possible together. While not all political parties took part, representatives of churches, communities and cultural groups did so. We attracted a large number of people from loyalist areas, many of whom were making their first visit to the Republic and felt, for the first time, that people in the Republic were interested in their views and in what they were doing. I believe the forum changed their attitudes and views. The participants also made valuable contacts in a range of areas. The forum has served its purpose in that regard. If we were in difficulties the situation would be different but we are not. The parties now see themselves working within the new institutions &ndash; the Executive, the Assembly and the North-South bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given much time in the past week to finalising the question of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, which Deputy Quinn continually and correctly raises. We must also pay attention to the parliamentary tier, to which both questions refer. We will deal with that aspect of the matter early in the new year. If we overcome the current <Col N="395" /> difficulties it will be useful to become involved on the parliamentary level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the sub-committee on obstacles to reconciliaton and its work to date, is the Taoiseach confident that obstacles will not be put in the way of reconciliation in the future? The report can only deal with what is at present an obstacle and what has been an obstacle in the past. Last weekend's human rights conference was critical of the Government's appointments to the human rights commission. Will the Taoiseach take care not to allow the creation of obstacles which would give the impression to people in Northern Ireland that we have a different rule book in this jurisdiction and are more open to cronyism than would be tolerated north of the Border? Is the Taoiseach confident such obstacles will not be created in the future? Has a <i>modus operandi </i>been established which would avoid the creation of obstacles to reconciliation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference of opinion on the issue referred to by Deputy Sargent. The Minister is meeting the organisations involved this week to try to resolve it. It will be important to resolve that matter.</P>
      <P>All Ministers and political parties are agreed that we should do whatever we can to be of assistance and to be beneficial and constructive. More often than not we give way to suggestions and initiatives. We often stand back from positions we have held in order to be helpful. That will not go on forever but it is important to do so in these initial years. We are dealing with a new situation. For many of the people involved the political operations are new and different. This applies to parties as well as to those who are moving into party structures for the first time. We try to be accommodating. The particular issue raised by Deputy Sargent is an exception but I hope it can be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the last opportunity the Taoiseach will have to report to the Dáil before the end of January. What are his hopes and expectations in relation to the Northern Ireland peace process between now and the time he will next report to the House on 30 January? What is in prospect and what are the Taoiseach's aspirations for the next six weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best to answer that question. Needless to say, over the past week or so there has been an enormous amount of dialogue and discussion, so I can give the House a fairly clear idea of the position. Deputy Quinn has stated where we will go if we get nowhere, and perhaps that is where I will start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do not make progress within the next six weeks &ndash; let us take the period until we discuss these issues again &ndash; the UUP council, and those who do not share the leadership's view, will try to take steps to further their agenda which would <Col N="396" /> be entirely unhelpful to all the pro-Agreement parties and the wishes of the parties in this House. Many small elements have to be resolved to avoid such a scenario.</P>
    <P>It is clear to everyone that there are three main elements. The Patten Commission published its report in September 1999. Since then, the legislation has gone through and has received Royal assent. The legislation in its present form is not considered satisfactory by Nationalists or Republicans. I have stated that I do not think it is realistic to amend the legislation in the short-term. The same would be the case with legislation passed by the Oireachtas &ndash; if Deputy O'Keeffe asked me on the Order of Business to amend legislation passed two weeks ago we all know what the reply would be. Therefore, I do not see the sense in telephoning Tony Blair to say that.</P>
    <P>I emphasise this point because people are suggesting I should be saying so. However, we have to live in the real world. Hopefully, through the implementation plan, we can move a long way towards trying to resolve things which are not there.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify the situation for those who closely study debates on Northern Ireland. I am not saying the implementation plan can undo or do what the legislation did not do in the view of Nationalists or Republicans. However, in the unlikely event of the legislation being amended, perhaps we should go as far as we possibly can in the implementation plan whereby it would at least provide a bridge to the future. If everything is not 100% or perhaps not even 75% &ndash; let us not put a percentage on it &ndash; then at least there is a way of moving on.</P>
    <P>It is my feeling in recent days that, unfortunately, it is unlikely people will fundamentally change their positions on Patten. We have made a lot of progress and moved a long way. Related to Patten, but under the same heading, are the issues of Gough barracks, the amalgamation of the CID and Special Branch, the disbandment of the reserve and a few smaller issues.</P>
    <P>The second issue is demilitarisation which is a call, in its entirety, for the British Government. The British Government knows what would be useful in that area. I also appreciate that the British Prime Minister has difficulties. It is easy for me to call on him to do X, Y and Z, but he has a Chief of Staff, a GOC and he has to listen to views. I may perhaps suggest that views are listened to too much, but that is still a problem I have to take into account. However, there are things which can be done on the demilitarisation issue.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the third issue which is a fundamental point for Mr. Trimble because it has placed him in his current difficulties &ndash; the lack of progress on decommissioning, the next move. Mr. Trimble cannot move until something happens on decommissioning. This is also a fundamental position of the British Government before it does anything on demilitarisation. We all know to some degree what would be helpful on decom<Col N="397" /> missioning. The most satisfactory move would be that the republican movement, and others if necessary &ndash; I am not focusing my attention on them, but they should also do so &ndash; should engage fully, seriously and in a determined way with the de Chastelain commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be enough, but I do not want to spell out what I think should happen in those discussions, although I have views on the matter. However, I would be strongly criticised &ndash; and I usually am in private when I say what I think should happen &ndash; therefore, for the purposes of this debate, I will say that engagement should happen and action of one form or another is necessary to get anywhere. That is not being descriptive about what the action should be.</P>
      <P>This is a complex question and I will create more difficulties for myself, and others, if I only answer half of it. In summary, there are three issues &ndash; Patten and its full implementation, demilitarisation and movement on the areas where all parties know we need movement and decommissioning. If all three, or at least the bottom two, were to move at least we could make progress. Otherwise we will run into difficulties when we again debate this issue in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach heard suggestions to the effect that the observation towers in south Armagh, to which such strong objection is taken by some Republicans, may have been instrumental in detecting, and thereby preventing, a very serious bombing attempt by the Real IRA on Castlewellan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand if I do not give a reply about a specific area. However, on many occasions I have heard that the observation towers have been crucial in helping to thwart many acts of terrorism. The other side of this issue, which the Deputy will know from his recent visits and briefings, which I appreciate, is that the area on this island with the heaviest concentration of security, intelligence, armaments and infrastructure is the Real IRA's No. 1 breeding ground. This is the case regarding the newer elements, never mind the older, detached elements. This must also be fed into the equation, not just as regards the towers but overall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other areas were hot spots down the years but having large numbers of army battalions, an enormous security infrastructure, huge numbers of special branch, CID, RUC and RUC Reserve do not stop the problem. This has to be fed into the equation. I am not suggesting for a minute that I would ask the British Prime Minister to ignore all his security advice. I would not do so. However, some remedial measures have to be included in the equation. There are resolutions <Col N="398" /> to this issue which would not undermine the entire security situation. I am not saying so from my information, as I am not a security expert, but from what people tell me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that, over the past eight years, the major beneficiary of President Clinton's term of office has been the republican movement in general, and Sinn Féin in particular? I say this because of the logjam in the State Department regarding access to the US, which Sinn Féin had been denied, and the decision by the Administration of which the Taoiseach and I were members to remove section 31, facilitated that movement in articulating its political point of view. Does the Taoiseach further agree that, in terms of the three areas he has correctly identified as requiring movement, an indication of serious movement on decommissioning &ndash; whether engagement with the de Chastelain commission or some other form, and it is not for me to prescribe &ndash; would create a facilitation on the other two issues? Will he join me and share the view that Gerry Adams, in particular, and the Sinn Féin leadership in general owe it to President Bill Clinton in the remaining weeks of his presidency to reciprocate the generosity and act of imagination he displayed to them by moving and convincing their IRA colleagues to move on the issue of decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Quinn. Perhaps I always mention President Clinton, but some very dedicated officials have given enormously of their time, one of whom was back here for the past week giving of his time to assist, even though he is long gone from the payroll. That is a service.  It is one thing to give a service to the United States of America, but his giving a service to us by coming back here in his own time is much appreciated. It would be of help to all those people involved if matters progressed.</P>
      <P>One of the ways in which we have made progress during the past six or seven years has been the way in which these matters are choreographed. It is necessary to choreograph these matters because otherwise nobody moves unless everybody moves. That is the only way we can realistically get work done. People should make a move. It is nearly Christmas, which is an important and peaceful time of the year.</P>
      <P>Sometimes I think of the number of hours I spent working on this area this year alone. I am not the only one or the only Leader who has spent hours working in this area. People, including Deputies Bruton, Spring and Reynolds, have done that for several years going back over the same ground. For the past two months I have been saying that these things do not change. We are dealing with the same issues. I cannot change them nor can anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish President Clinton well in his work today. I discussed these issues with him at some length <Col N="399" /> yesterday and on other occasions in recent months. Talking about these issues does not change them. Everyone knows what would help. Everyone knows the areas, and perhaps everyone knows what cannot be done. In reply to the Deputy's question, it seems it would be a good time for people to get on with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was more use not made of President Clinton's visit to break the logjam on decommissioning, demilitarisation, policing and the North-South bodies? Why was a talks process not put in place in the two weeks leading up to President Clinton's arrival to get politicians in Northern Ireland, who are talking about everything but those four issues, to talk about them face to face across the community divide rather than across the airwaves? If the Taoiseach is not aware, the entire talks process, which was launched originally as a twin-track approach by John Major and myself when I was Taoiseach, was launched literally when President Clinton was in the air setting out for these islands against the deadline of his arrival. Were it not for his arrival, we would not ever have got the twin-track approach launched. We probably would not have the Good Friday Agreement, were it not for the use of that deadline as a means of breaking logjams that were otherwise there in both systems on both sides of the Irish Sea. Will the Taoiseach agree a huge opportunity has been lost in not using President Clinton's third visit to these islands to act as a similar deadline or incentive to move things forward in advance of his arrival, to use it as the occasion for a break through, rather than the occasion for a sentimental retrospective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree with that because it is not in line with the facts nor is it in line with history. To go back and start saying when things happened, when they did not happen and when they usefully happened is not helpful.</P>

      <P>For the past fortnight the two key officials on this from a long way back, Sandy Berger and Jim Steinberg, have been working extremely hard getting President Clinton an absolutely clear briefing on all the nuances. The President has it absolutely 100% clearly in his mind who, how, where and what can resolve this. All that ground work was done by those two gentlemen in conjunction with the British Government, the Irish Government and all the parties. That work has been done quietly and effectively. Whether the talks can move it on today or whether it will take a bit more time or whether there is a possibility of doing that, I do not know. The President's previous two visits were very helpful and this one is equally so. In the past ten days, the issues have been addressed in a more meaningful way and people have focused on what would be useful and how it could be useful, but at the end of the day neither President Clinton, I nor anybody else can make people do things. President Clinton will also have discussions with the British Government and there are issues on which the British Government will have to move for everything to fall into place. Last night as soon as President Clinton went to Belfast, he immediately got into those talks, which I appreciated, given how tired he was. He had a tough few days, a flight, the day here yesterday and having regard to his programme for the week ahead, he still got straight into those talks late last night. Let us see where it goes from there.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree there is a high degree of urgency now affecting the matter in so far as we are up against the Ulster Unionist Council meeting in January? We are also up against the likelihood of a general election in Britain, which, as we know, in 1974 had a distinctly unhelpful effect on institutions at that time and is potentially quite a dangerous event. Will the Taoiseach agree that while commending the work of Mr. Berger and Mr. Steinberg, the ultimate solution is to be found by the politicians themselves on both sides of the divide within Northern Ireland and the truth is that while they are talking to one another about <Col N="401" /> everything, including the details of public finance in Northern Ireland, allocating budgets, operating ministries and health services and all sorts of things, they are not engaging with one another on policing, demilitarisation, decommissioning across the divide, and that what needs to be done is to get them to face these issues together along with the two Governments? Will he agree that President Clinton's imminent arrival would have been an occasion for a focused, short, sharp discussion on these issues with a view to resolving them, if possible?</P>
      <P>We are now heading into Christmas, it will soon be January and time is not on our side in resolving these issues. While I say this not to criticise the Taoiseach, as he knows from discussions I have had with him about this matter that I am not saying anything in the House that I have not said directly to him privately, the truth is that time is not on our side, not on anyone's side in this area. While the Taoiseach is doing all he can as an individual, the institutional structures are not there to get the people who need to do so to face the issues with one another. It is now a matter of great urgency that we get the people around the same table to push this thing forward before the first half of next year, which could potentially be a very unproductive time unless the work is done.</P>

      <P>When everyone is around a table to discuss the issues all the parties take different views on the Patten report and the longer they stay at the table the further they get from a common position. On demilitarisation, one section will say there should be strengthening of security in some of the key areas while other sections feel there should be almost no security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic cost of maintaining a child as estimated in the Combat Poverty Agency funded report in 1994 would come to about £36.50 per week in today's money. This estimate does not take account of the cost of paid child care for parents who go out to work.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget, I provided for increases in child benefit of £25 per month for the first two children and £30 for the third and subsequent children. This is only the first of three years of increases which will see Government investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003, which is almost a threefold increase.</P>
      <P>This means that by 2002, we will have exceeded the PPF commitment to move towards child benefit rates of £100 per month for third and subsequent children. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains the commitment that, recognising the progress made in the negotiations in relation to child care, following a completion process with the social partners, the Government would adopt a strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs. A cross-cutting approach to this issue has been adopted in this year's budget which takes account of the diverse viewpoints of the social partners.</P>
      <P>First, the substantial improvements in child benefit will assist parents who use paid child care, while simultaneously supporting those who choose to work within the home and care for their children in that way. Second, there is provision for an exemption from benefit-in-kind tax for employer-provided child care which should assist on the supply side. In addition, the budget provides for a Civil Service child care initiative involving the provision of fifteen civil service crèches over the next two years. Third, the significant improvements in after-tax income will also assist families with child care costs. Finally, spending is being front-loaded through allocation of £104 million in the Estimates for next year.</P>
      <P>On child poverty, the most recent independent survey carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute shows that the level of consistent poverty among children has dropped to 12%, a fall of almost 30%, in the 12 month period from 1997 to 1998.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information:</i>This Government is committed to maintaining this downward trend.  To this end, child poverty has been identified as a central issue for consideration in the review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why must parents wait six months until June? Why are they in deficit, as it were, for six months for this payment? Will the Minister introduce child benefit or what are his <Col N="404" /> expectations for 2002? What has been built in regarding finances? When will increases be paid? Will it be January, April or June for 2002?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister believe it is time the Government set down a basic minimum income payment for children? We have not ever done so here, which is out of line with the UN convention on children and it is also out of line with the strategy on children. We have not said what a basic minimum income payment for children should be. As the Minister said, the Combat Poverty Agency estimates the cost of rearing a child at £36.50 per week, though many parents would feel it is a great deal more. Should we examine this and do some research into it? This figure does not take account of child care payments, which are an extra cost for many parents. For those on minimum incomes the payment does not meet that basic standard, which takes food and clothing into account but none of the extras. Has the time come for us to decide as a country what a minimum income payment for children should be, in the same way as we have done for adults in the social welfare code? This would put us in line with other countries.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister have any plans to pay child benefit on a weekly basis for families who budget on a weekly basis? That is how it is done in England. As we are now moving towards having child benefit as the main support for families, is the Minister considering this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding payment dates, it is true to say the Government has made a decision to bring back the payment dates of child benefit. In this budget we have indicated that payments in the coming year will be made in June as opposed to September. That is as much as we can physically do in the first year given the time constraints. It is a huge job to bring back payment dates from the Department's point of view in relation to the delivery of payments. We have indicated that we will endeavour to progressively bring the payment date as near as we can to the date of the general increases &ndash; something which I know the Deputy welcomes &ndash; which will be made from 5 April 2001 and 1 January 2002. We have not looked at the issue of whether they would be paid on a weekly basis. All of this is tied into the delivery of social welfare payments and the further we move to the greater use of technology such as electronic fund transfer and ways in which perhaps other changes&mdash;</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious problems faced by social welfare recipients who do not have bank accounts in accessing their benefits due to revised bank rules on changing cheques and continued bank and building society branch closures.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department issues more than half a million cheques every month and is not aware of any systematic problems regarding the encashment of cheques by social welfare recipients. Cheques are but one of a range of payment methods offered by my Department and would account for about 11% of payment instruments issued. On very rare occasions it has happened that some individuals experienced difficulty in cashing their cheques because they had <Col N="406" /> inadequate identification. These problems were resolved on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Recently some banks introduced a policy whereby cheques must be lodged and cleared before value is given to the customer. Cheques issued by my Department are drawn on the Bank of Ireland which has given an assurance that the recent changes in its cheque encashment policy will not affect social welfare cheques. My Department has an ongoing arrangement with Bank of Ireland whereby social welfare cheques may be cashed at any branch of Bank of Ireland provided the bank is satisfied regarding the identity and bona fides of the customer. While exact figures are not available, it is reckoned that the majority of social welfare recipients cash their cheques at retail outlets and as such any change in bank practice does not impact upon them.</P>
      <P>Cheques by their nature are more likely to be lost, stolen or fraudulently altered than would be the case with other payment instruments. An alternative for people would be to opt for the electronic payment method which is much more secure and efficient than cheques. If social welfare recipients should experience any difficulties in cashing their cheques arising from the closure of bank or building society branches, it is my Department's policy to ensure that alternative payment arrangements are made for them. If the Deputy is aware of any individuals who have experienced difficulties in cashing their cheques perhaps he would provide me with the relevant details and I will arrange to have those individual cases examined further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his chief accountant who contacted me recently about this. There is ongoing concern, particularly in Dublin and Limerick, about the changes in the encashment policy of, specifically Bank of Ireland and AIB, but also of other financial institutions. Senior citizens, in particular, felt they were being refused by different branches or had to provide for example, a driving licence or passport type identification, which can very often be difficult in those circumstances. There is also the ongoing problem that urban post offices are inundated with people in receipt of unemployment assistance on collection day, and there are long queues for service.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of back to education benefits say they were refused a service at their own Bank of Ireland branch and had to go to an entirely different branch. There seems to be a great deal of inconsistency in relation to the encashment of social welfare payments despite the improvements of recent years. Would it be possible for the Minister to come forward with a general policy on it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to an ongoing bank and building society consolidation. In my constituency, a number of branches have closed offices. Bank of Ireland in Howth, for example, has closed and Bank of Ireland branches in Dublin central, Cabra and Stoneybatter have closed. <Col N="407" /> Senior citizens have campaigned to prevent these closures but have failed. People feel they have been left high and dry. Perhaps the Minister with his colleague the Minister for Finance, will welcome the Bill being sponsored by my colleagues, Senators Joe Costello, Kathleen O'Meara and Brendan Ryan in the Seanad to amend the Central Bank Act to require banks to guarantee that certain locations would be facilitated, before licences are continued or are offered to them? In summary, will the Minister give us a general policy guideline on the whole encashment matter and on the electronic transfer system as it operates across the Department and will he support to the Labour Party Bill on the location of financial institutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first I have heard of that Bill, so I will not comment on it. I could go into a lengthy list of the various payment methods of the Department. They are designed to give the recipient, as much flexibility as possible. The Department encourages people to use payable order books or the electronic fund transfer which is the safest method of payment. I am aware that the banks have tightened up a great deal. Much of this has to do with the issue of hot money and fraud in the system. However, it is only where they believe a fraud is being perpetrated and in relation to, for example, third party cheques. Social welfare cheques are always accepted. There is a long-standing arrangement between the Bank of Ireland and the Department, because that is the bank we use for these, that all these cheques will be accepted at their various branches. Individual bank officials have to be a little more careful because they are personally liable, and are under an obligation to assure themselves that the person who presents himself or herself is entitled to the money which he or she will pay out.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware and having checked with officials, there have not been any complaints to social welfare offices throughout the country about people having difficulty, but if the Deputy has any instances&mdash;</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. Based on the research carried out in the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, the number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. At the end of November 2000, there were 16,405 carers in receipt of carer's allowance &ndash; of this number, 13,543 or 83% are in receipt of the allowance at the maximum rate. These figures indicate that 33% of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 78% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million next year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
      <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot, and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>It was with this in mind that I recently announced a number of additional measures to support carers in budget 2001. I made provision for a substantial increase in the income disregards from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple at an estimated full year cost of more than £18 million. This will take effect from April 2001 and will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment. The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income of up to £15,100, can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £25,100 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus free schemes and respite care grant. The income disregards I have introduced already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance.</P>
      <P>As I announced in my budget speech, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation, whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also made provision for an increase in the amount of the respite care grant from £300 to £400. Respite care is one of the most important services required by carers. Regular planned breaks and emergency cover can assist a carer and reduce the stresses on them. Carers who are caring for more than one care recipient will be entitled to a double respite care grant, that is, <Col N="409" /> £800. These increases in the respite care grant will be paid in June 2001, when the grant is next due, at a full year cost of more than £3 million.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the issue of a cost of care allowance, and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children as is any estimate of lower health provision arising from the payment of a carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The many measures I have introduced for carers clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers and are a concrete expression of our appreciation for their valuable role in our society. In addition, my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Environment and Local Government, have also brought forward proposals in the recent budget to assist carers. This Government has developed a cross-cutting approach to the needs of carers and I look forward to developing this further in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Carers were very disappointed with the provisions in the budget. It is clear from the Minister's figures that of those carers the Department recognises, which is a tiny proportion of the number the Carers' Association say exist, 34,000 do not get anything. Only 25% get the full payment. The majority of carers do not get anything from the State. Does the Minister agree it is time to consider a cost of care payment, based on a needs analysis, for carers in recognition of the work done by them which, in many cases, keeps people out of hospitals, nursing homes and institutions, but often at great personal cost, so that more carers are recognised and financially supported by the State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not refer to the additional supports given by the State mainly through the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. It would be wrong for her to suggest thousands of people are not getting help from the State; they are, and it would be demeaning to those who work in the health boards to suggest otherwise. As regards income adequacy, carer's allowance was introduced to give support to people on low incomes. That is the way it was designed. Obviously, the very significant changes in the budget, which cost £21 million, will result in more carers being brought in. The carer's benefit, which is now in vogue, will also have a major effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A consultancy study has been set up in my Department in regard to long-term care issues. The Minister for Finance indicated in the budget that he will consider tax relief on insurance products, which might assist the issue of long-term care. As regards the continual care payment, both I and the Minister for Health and Children are currently in discussion on how we can progress the issue of needs assessment which must be put in place before we can bring forward a continual care payment based on the need not only of the <Col N="410" /> person being cared for but the carer. My Department cannot put that in place because my officials are not qualified to determine whether one person is worse off than another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 34,000 carers, as the Minister recognises, do not get any payment because of the stringent means test. There is need to address this. There were tax relief provisions in the budget for those in nursing homes but not for those caring at home. There is scope there for further improvement. The Minister should examine that for the social welfare Bill. There is also scope for further improvement in the tax system for carers at home. They are not getting a basic care allowance yet we know the cost of care at home is expensive. Does the Minister agree that, even with the increases in the budget, it is disturbing that the amount we spend on social protection as a percentage of our income is much lower than in other EU countries? </P>

      <Quest>the impact the abolition of the ceiling on PRSI payments will have on the social insurance fund; the net cost of the social welfare increases announced in the budget, when these extra receipts are taken into account; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced, as part of Budget 2001, a package of PRSI measures. These included a reduction of 0.5%, to 4%, in the main employee rate; the abolition of the employer ceiling; a reduction of 2% to 3%, in the rate of social insurance applicable to the self-employed, and the abolition of the annual earnings ceiling for the self-employed.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the employer ceiling will yield £24 million in 2001 and £159 million in a full year. The abolition of the self-employed ceiling will yield £40 million in 2001 and £97 million in a full year. When the reductions in PRSI rates, which I mentioned earlier, are factored in, the overall impact of these changes is a cost of £7 million to the social insurance fund in 2001 and a yield of £117 million in a full year. The budget also made provision for unprecedented levels of increase in the rates of benefits and pensions payable from the fund. These will cost nearly £203 million in 2001 and more than £270 million in a full year. Accordingly, the net cost of all the changes relating to the social insurance fund introduced in the recent budget is £210 million in 2001 and £153 million in a full year. As the Deputy is aware, the fund is in a healthy financial state at present. This is due to increased levels of employment, lower levels of unemployment and the buoyant economic climate generally. This surplus will not continue indefinitely as ageing of the population will greatly increase demands on the fund over the medium to long term, an issue to which the Deputy referred earlier in regard to social protection. Clearly, it is important that the fund's surplus should be used to best advantage having regard to emerging demands and the overall interest of its contributors. As announced recently, the Minister for Finance and I are arranging to have an early examination of possible strategies in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Carers' Association is more concerned at what the Minister has not done rather than what has been done in this budget. As regards the social insurance fund, with the great resources we have at present, does the Minister accept there is need to enhance benefits for recipients? Many people see PRSI as a tax. The benefits they receive are not what they should be, particularly in the dental, optical and medical areas. Has the social insurance fund board been established? What is its task? Who is on the board? Have decisions been made? As regards the surplus money and the need to introduce new benefits, is the Minister considering further paid parental leave so that parents, often it will be mothers, have an opportunity to take longer time off work in the early years and get benefit as happens in many other countries? That was recom<Col N="412" /> mended in a number of reports. Is it not time to grasp this issue and give parents of young children a real opportunity to have a choice as to whether they stay at home or go out into the workforce, particularly during the early years of their children's lives? Other countries have gone down the road of paid parental leave and extended periods of parental leave. With the surplus in the social insurance fund, is it not time to consider this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There was reference in it to paid parental leave and the Government will bring forward proposals in that regard in the future. As regards benefits, I am surprised at the Deputy saying we should bring forward benefits when again looking at the Minister's budget speech, there was a record increase in benefits in this budget and a record delivery of money out of the social insurance fund to those recipients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a record budget package of £850 million, about 50% of which would be from the social insurance fund. The social insurance fund is in a very healthy state but it will not remain that way forever. One only has to look at the position in Italy, for example, which is spending a huge amount of its GDP in proportion to the overall situation on the elderly, whereas we are spending an awful lot less because of demographics. One does not have to be a rocket scientist in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated that both himself and myself will be looking at the situation in relation to the social insurance fund. There are commitments in the PPF in relation to the future of the social insurance fund to which we will obviously adhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is setting his sights too low. There is an incredible surplus. Inflation also has to be dealt with. The reality is that a widow under 66 years on a contributory pension will now get £89.10, the carer's benefit is set out £96.50 and so on. I do not think the Minister should be as satisfied as he appears to be in relation to the level of these benefits. If one looks at the response of many of the agencies like CORI and St. Vincent de Paul, which are working with people experiencing poverty and who are just above the poverty line, including those on low incomes, I do not think the Minister should be as satisfied as he is saying he is. There is a real need for further improvements in relation to benefits and social welfare.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>when the fuel allowance was set at the rate of £5; the duration of the payment at that time; the changes that have been made since in that regard; the accumulated consumer price index since this £5 rate was set; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April. Some £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones as and when these zones are introduced.</P>
      <P>Up to 1988, assistance with fuel costs was provided through two schemes, the urban and the national fuel schemes. The assistance provided under both schemes was the same &ndash; £5 per week for 30 weeks. The rate payable was set at £5 from October 1985. The two schemes were rationalised and a single unified scheme was introduced in October 1988. The fuel season was reduced to 26 weeks but entitlement was extended to include 30,000 long-term unemployment assistance recipients.</P>
      <P>The duration of the scheme remained at 26 weeks until this year's budget when the fuel season has been increased to 29 weeks. The current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001 and the start of the next fuel season will be brought forward by one week to the beginning of October 2001.</P>
      <P>Every person who gets a fuel allowance also gets a weekly primary social welfare payment, such as unemployment assistance or old age pension. For this reason, the fuel allowance payment rate cannot be looked at in isolation from primary payment rates. It is important that the overall increase taking primary payments and fuel allowances together is sufficient to fully compensate for all inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
      <P>Fuel price movements are tracked in the fuel and light component of the CPI. This shows that fuel price inflation was 25.3% in total between October 1985 and October 2000. The overall consumer price index rose by 52.1% in the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases in overall weekly social welfare payment rates have compensated fully for <Col N="414" /> inflation, including fuel price inflation, over the period. For example, the total weekly payment for a single retirement pensioner with a fuel allowance rose by over 79% while the total weekly payment for an unemployed person rose by over 106%.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>This does not take into account the increases announced in last week's budget which were the largest ever provided. These will provide a real increase after fully compensating for inflation.</P>
    <P>Giving people a real increase for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, I believe it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs. Also, it can be very difficult for people on low incomes to adjust to the loss of the fuel allowance in April when the fuel season ends. Those difficulties would be made worse by increasing the fuel allowance instead of giving a larger all year round increase.</P>
    <P>I have opted, as was recommended in the review, for giving substantial all year round increases in this year's budget. All social welfare primary payments increase by either £8 or £10 per week. The qualified adult allowance will also be increased by amounts ranging from £7 to £15. This means that in 2001, a pensioner couple, where both are over pension age, will get a combined increase of between £20 and £25 per week. Furthermore, these increases will come into effect from April 2001, a month earlier than this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister ashamed that the level of the fuel allowance introduced in 1985 has remained unchanged in the 15 intervening years? The Minister is good at telling us all the time how he has improved and changed things and how he has brought forward extra money. In this case, there has been no movement in 15 years. The consumer price index has changed by 52% in that time so the very minimum it should be is £7.50 and even if one takes the fuel cost increase, it should bring it to £6.20.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister stand over a Department that fails to keep track of the consumer price index and the fuel price index? All the Minister is doing is marking time. In fact, the allowance was reduced in 1988 from 30 weeks to 26 weeks. Does the Minister agree that there is a decided need to change this fuel allowance and to increase it? Perhaps the best way to do it might be to give it all year round.</P>

      <P>I looked at this issue but I took the strong advice from my officials and from the expenditure review published about a year ago, or maybe more, which said that rather than increase the fuel allowance, it would be better to increase the general increases which is what I did. I put the extra money we had into the general increases because people get those for 52 weeks of the year instead of 26 or 29 weeks.</P>
      <P>The other issue, which is very important, is that the more one increases the fuel allowance, the more the sudden death there is for a family in April. I do not have to tell Deputies that there are families who use this as a payment and do not use it just for fuel. In effect, the more one increases that payment, the more they lose and the greater the sudden death come April. I would be worried about families which rely totally on social welfare as there would be a severe loss in their income come April.</P>
      <P>I would be inclined to agree with the Deputy and would far rather put the money into the general increases and give them for 52 weeks of the year. I agree with the Deputy in that if I had a chance, I would like to merge the fuel allowance into the overall payment and, in effect, do away with the fuel allowance so that it would be paid for 52 weeks of the year.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is actually conceding the point I made that people who have been on the fuel allowance for the last 15 years at £5 per week are sick of getting it at that level. He is agreeing that it should be extended to the whole year. What he is also admitting is that he did not have the clout at Cabinet to get that increase. We all know he brought forward a package of compensation for those on social welfare but, unfortunately, it was turned down. One of the items in it would have been an increase in the fuel allowance for 52 weeks &ndash; that is what he is saying &ndash; but all he got was a three week increase. That is not very good. It is a dismal failure on the Minister's part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, I am sure, aware that decisions on entitlement to statutory social welfare schemes under social welfare legislation is a matter for statutorily appointed deciding officers who are appointed by the Minister of the day but who are independent in the exercise of their function. I have no role in relation to such decisions.</P>
      <P>When determining cases deciding officers are bound by the legislation governing the scheme in question. Their task is to establish the facts of the case based on the evidence available and to then apply the legislation to those facts. Under social welfare legislation, a deciding officer may revise a previous decision if new facts or evidence are brought to his or her attention, if there is a relevant change in the circumstances or if a mistake is made in relation to the law or the facts. The need for a revised decision may arise because of new information furnished by the individual claimant or following review of entitlement where the Department establishes that there has been a material change of circumstance. A person who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer may appeal to the social welfare appeals office which provides an independent accessible and fair appeals service in a prompt and courteous manner. In processing social welfare claims, all staff are obliged to follow fair procedures.</P>
      <P>In this connection, detailed guidelines have been furnished to the staff on good decision making, including guidance on proper procedure, on weighing the evidence, and on the need to take account of the principles of natural and constitutional justice which have been laid down by the courts. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure consistency of decisions by all staff who are involved in the processing of claims, including deciding officers and social welfare investigators.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the procedures followed by my staff give rise to good quality decisions being made and that there are adequate measures in place to ensure redress in any case where a person is not happy with the decision in his or her case.</P>

      <P>I worry a little. The Minister seems to detach himself from responsibility for what goes on in the Department. That applies to all Ministers. While I accept the tiger economy has been beneficial to making life easier for many people, it appears, from my experience of dealing with constituents, there is a distinct change and a tendency not to have the same regard for the rights and liberties of the citizen as previously, not only during the term of office of those on this side but by way of comparison with previous Administrations from that side of the House. That distinct impression has been created. I note the Minister's rebuttal of that. I hope he accepts full responsibility for what goes on in the Department and that the Department does not tell him what to do.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the number of appeals made to the chief appeals officer in the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2000 on the basis of being found not to fulfil the genuinely seeking work criteria; the number of appeals made in each of the years 1998 and 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of appeals relating to unemployment payments received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office up to end-November 2000 was 4,996. The figures for 1999 and 1998 were 3,603 and 2,527 respectively.</P>
      <P>The figures include cases disallowed for failure to satisfy any of the statutory conditions relating to entitlement. An exact figure is not readily available of the number of these appeals involving the issue mentioned by the Deputy but it is estimated that about 80% of the appeals would relate to the conditions of not being available for or genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>As is evident from the figures, an increasing number of people are availing of their statutory rights to appeal against decisions of deciding officers with which they are dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>To be regarded as genuinely seeking work a person must show that he or she is taking reasonable steps to obtain suitable full-time work, including applying for and seeking information on jobs, and availing of suitable training opportunities. These requirements are set out in regulations. To ensure that they are applied consistently and uniformly detailed guidelines have been issued to the statutorily appointed deciding officers who decide unemployment claims, and appropriate training has been provided. The decisions advisory office of my Department also provides advice in respect of individual cases on a day-to-day basis.</P>
      <P>In the current economic climate there are many employment opportunities available, both full and part-time, and many employers state that they are finding it difficult to fill vacancies. Deciding officers must have regard to this environment in reviewing and testing individuals' efforts to obtain full-time employment.</P>
      <P>As the live register continues to fall, all persons in receipt of unemployment payments are having their claims reviewed on a more regular, systematic basis. Each case is decided in accordance with the regulations, having regard to what is reasonable in that particular case.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>Other Deputies present and I were invited by the Minister to the launch of a report from the family unit of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs tomorrow, entitled Flexible Working Patterns. It seeks to <Col N="419" /> encourage people, perhaps women on home duties and others, to engage in the workforce, yet at the same time the doubling of the number of appeals shows clearly that he is targeting people in certain areas and in certain jobs.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 56, 60, 72, 178, 180, 182, 183 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. While care groups have stated this figure to be around 120,000 carers, they have provided no supporting basis for this figure. The high number may be due to their definition of carer, whereby a person visiting or assisting an older person may consider himself or herself to be a carer.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the purpose of the carer's allowance is to support carers providing full-time care and attention for persons who are medically assessed as having such a serious disability that they require care for at least 12 months. Based on the research carried out in the review, the number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> At the end of November 2000, there were 16,405 carers in receipt of carer's allowance &ndash; of this number, 13,543, or 83%, were in receipt of the allowance at the maximum rate and 2,862, or 17%, were in receipt of the allowance at a reduced rate. A total of 13,011 claims have been refused in the ten years that this scheme has been in operation.</P>
    <P>These figures show that 33% of full-time carers are in receipt of carer's allowance which is an increase of 78% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million next year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
    <P>The carer's benefit scheme was introduced on 26 October this year. This new scheme is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. The scheme involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by my Department. This will be based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period, which is a key feature of the scheme. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, is currently drawing up carer's leave legislation to protect the employment rights of the carer. It is planned to publish this Bill very shortly.</P>
    <P>The maximum duration of carer's benefit is set at 15 months, as it is considered that employers would experience difficulties in preserving an employee's rights for a longer period. This time period of 15 months will facilitate carers who have to leave the workforce temporarily to care full time.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that eventually there could be in the region of 6,800 people on carer's benefit, but it must be recognised that it will take some years before this scheme reaches maturity. In the meantime, I expect that the scheme will have in the region of 500 to 1,000 recipients in the first number of years.</P>
    <P>In the recent budget, in addition to the substantial rate increases of £8 for carers aged under 66 and £10 for carers aged over 66, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. This will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment. It is not possible at this time to determine the rate of carer's allowance that each of these new carers will receive. However, the effect of this increase will ensure that a couple <Col N="423" /> with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance, while a couple in receipt of £25,100 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes and the measures that I have introduced further enhance the qualification criteria for this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all a good story. The Deputy is trying to curtail me.</P>
      <P>In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider that abolition of the means test, at a cost in the region of £180 million, to be the best way to support carers or the best use of resources. That was also the case in the review of the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>The income disregards I have introduced already exceed the income limits for the minimum wage rate for joint income households and ensure that carers receive a maximum allowance. As I announced in my budget speech, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation, whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information</i>The review of the carer's allowance examined the question of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment and concluded that, in view of the fact that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring, limited resources should not be used to make two income support payments to any one individual. Of course, a person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which he or she is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was a new annual respite care grant payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance to use in whatever way they choose. There has been <Col N="424" /> very positive feedback on this payment and with this in mind, I also made provision for an increase in the amount of the respite care grant from £300 to £400. Respite care is one of the most important services required by carers. Regular planned breaks and emergency cover can assist a carer and reduce the stresses on them. In addition, carers who are caring for more than one care recipient will be entitled to a double respite care grant of £800. These increases will become effective in June 2001, when the grant is next due, at a full year cost of more than £3 million.</P>
    <P>Other supports that I have introduced in my last three budgets for carers in receipt of the carer's allowance or carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance include eligibility for the free schemes, the &ldquo;full-time care and attention&rdquo; rule has been relaxed to allow carers in receipt of carer's allowance to take up paid employment for up to ten hours per week, the residency condition has been relaxed to allow for each non-resident care situation to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, carers are no longer required to satisfy the &ldquo;13 paid contribution&rdquo; rule when claiming disability benefit, carers now qualify for credited PRSI contributions, carers who have ceased their caring responsibilities are now eligible for the back to education allowance and back to work allowance and the introduction of the carer's benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the issue of a cost of care allowance and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children, as is the question of producing a White Paper on caring and carers. The estimated cost of introducing a monthly universal cost of care allowance of, for example, £100 would be in the region of £60 million based on the current number of carers.</P>
    <P>In the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government pledged to put in place a co-ordinated approach to address the needs of carers. One of the key priorities we set was to develop a partnership model to facilitate the development, by the State in conjunction with the private sector, of an improved system for meeting long-term care costs.</P>
    <P>To this end, I recently initiated a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care. The study will examine the strategic issues involved and will involve an assessment of alternative financing and funding approaches and their feasibility in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>The study, which also involves the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance, will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs both in the community and in institutional care and the potential of the private sector or a combined public-private sector approach to develop new initiatives in this area. I look forward to the completion of this study by the middle of next year.</P>
    <P>The many measures I have introduced for carers clearly indicate my personal commitment and <Col N="425" /> that of the Government to carers and are a concrete expression of our appreciation for their valuable role in our society. In addition, my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals in the recent budget to assist carers.</P>

For two years I have asked why the plight of a widow who becomes a carer has again been ignored in the budget, despite my ongoing campaign? Will the Minister indicate the number of carers who have become widows in any one year? Does he consider it fair that a carer who becomes a widow loses the car<Col N="427" /> er's allowance when she qualifies for the widow's pension despite the fact that she may continue to be a full time carer for a doubly incontinent bedridden person in her own home?

      <P>I have answered the Deputy before on this question. The review looked at the issue of two social welfare payments and recommended that the principle of paying one social payment should not be broken to ensure the resources at our disposal go to those most in need. The continual care payment is the answer to those who lose out in the context outlined by the Deputy. It was discussed before he entered the Chamber. It cannot be put in place until the needs assessment scheme is established at health board level to determine those who deserve or need the payment. The issue is currently being discussed by me and the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

It is a disgrace that somebody should be left in that situation. Will the Minister not take political responsibility for addressing this issue? We like to blame committees for decisions of this kind but will the Minister, as a political leader, ensure that the widow or widower who becomes a carer is justly rewarded?</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes in the means test for families involved. They are the first in three and a half years. Will the Minister relax the criteria regarding the residence of a carer? It is very important. Persons caring for loved ones are entitled to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> The issue of close proximity was included in the regulations I introduced to try to take account of situations where people were living beside each other. Up to then the criteria were very rigid. We have removed the issue of close proximity. Each case is determined on its merits. The test is whether or not a person is giving full time care and attention, irrespective of the business. They must live relatively closely to enable full time care and attention to be provided.</P>
    <P>On the question of minimum rights for carers, I am responsible for the carer's allowance, not the carer's benefit. Very significant changes have been made over the last three and a half years. In this year's budget a co-ordinated approach was taken by the Ministers for Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and me. Each Minister introduced changes for carers. I introduced changes to the carer's allowance and the care grant. The other Ministers dealt with the disabled person's grant. A number of other initiatives were taken. Tax changes were made by the Minister for Finance. For each of the past few years changes have been made by those Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is abroad on business and I wish to reply to the questions raised on his behalf. Within the last few months four of the people in custody on charges arising in connection with the murder of Detective Garda McCabe have been granted short periods of compassionate parole. The applications for compassionate parole were considered in accordance with the normal criteria which applies in such cases.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate it has never been the practice to disclose personal details in relation to prisoners, especially of a kind which would warrant the granting of compassionate parole.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am assured that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was satisfied in each case that the granting of a period of compassionate parole was justified.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that Members share revulsion at the dreadful crimes committed by the prisoners in question. I understand particularly that releases of this kind can cause understandable distress to the family of the victim. However, the granting of compassionate parole has long been a feature of prisons administration both here and elsewhere and each case must be assessed on its merits.</P>
      <P>We are aware of media reports today about the behaviour of two of the prisoners in question when they were on temporary release. I want to make it clear that no reports of breaches of the conditions surrounding these temporary releases have been made to the prison authorities. Any such reports would be fully investigated.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities were informed of the releases in question. It is an operational decision as to what gardaí are informed of the fact that temporary release has been granted. It is also at their discretion whether particular individuals are informed about releases. All releases are subject to standard conditions, such as to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. It is not the practice to disclose in individual cases what further conditions, if any, may be added.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is abroad at the moment, has been made aware of the media reports in question. While he has no plans to review the compassionate leave system which has been operated by successive Administrations, he is determined that if any abuses of the system come to light, they will be fully investigated and any appropriate action taken.</P>

Is it satisfactory that a mem<Col N="430" /> ber of the McCabe family could have come across one of these people by accident without any knowledge that they were at liberty? Is there any confidential agreement between the Department or the Prison Service and these prisoners? Are they subject to any special privileged regime or have discussions taken place with representatives of these prisoners for a particular regime to be applied to them? </P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to outline for the Deputy the difference between compassionate parole and early release. Compassionate parole is not early release. I understand that in some of the cases the gardaí informed the family of compassionate parole, but that did not happen in all cases. The Minister has asked that procedures be put in place in particular circumstances to ensure that the victim's family is informed of compassionate parole being granted in these cases for obvious compassionate reasons. We are not talking about early release but about compassionate parole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State acknowledge that what she is now referring to as compassionate parole is temporary release and is normally referred to as temporary release? Does she understand and accept that there would be widespread public revulsion at the fact that temporary release has been granted to these prisoners, given that it is less than two years since these four persons were sentenced for the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe? Would she acknowledge that in the context of the imposition of sentences of 14 years, it is unprecedented for four persons sentenced and convicted for the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána to be given temporary release within less than two years of them starting to serve those sentences?</P>
      <P>Could the Minister of State explain why it is only now that the Minister is considering the issue of ensuring that in the context of any future release the widow and perhaps other family members of Detective Garda McCabe will be informed? Could she explain how the Minister reconciles the granting of temporary release to each of these prisoners in the context of assurances given to this House and publicly given by the Taoiseach and the Minister prior and subsequent to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and as recently as August of this year that the killers of Detective Garda McCabe would not qualify for early release? Is it the reality that temporary release is now providing for early release by stealth? This House requires confirmation from the Minister of State, the Minister and the Taoiseach that further early releases will not be granted to these prisoners at such an early stage in their sentences.</P>

I want a clear answer to my next question. Are there any confidential arrangements involving the Department or the Prison Service in connection with the detention of these prisoners? Have there been any negotiations on these prisoners' behalf with the Minister or representatives of his Department? The Minister of State indicated to the House that four of the convicted prisoners have been granted parole on compassionate grounds or temporary release. How many occasions in total involved these prisoners?</P>

      <P>Members either want to hear the answer or they do not. If they continue to interrupt they will not hear my answers and it will be clear that they do not want to hear them. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach have stated on many occasions that the persons convicted in connection with the death of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe do not qualify for release under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. If Deputy Shatter had been listening he would have heard me say that earlier. That is the third time I have made that remark during this debate&mdash;</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister of State that, in the context of the normal regime which applies in respect of temporary releases, this decision is extraordinary and unprecedented in view of the seriousness of the crime committed, the statements of Mrs. Ann McCabe and the relatively short portion of their sentences that theses prisoners have served. Is there a political dimension attaching to this decision? Has some agreement been reached with Sinn Féin or any other political grouping in respect of this matter? This is not the normal practice that applies in respect of the temporary release of ordinary prisoners. Even though the Minister of State indicated that these prisoners are not eligible for release under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, is this not a way to release them which does not fall within the normal bounds? Is there a political dimension to this decision?</P>

The Minister of State is aware of the sensitivities which apply in respect of this issue and of the groundswell of public opinion against the decision to release these prisoners. Is it not rather sad that we are obliged to question her about this matter which would not have come to light unless the GRA was alerted to the releases by some of its members and expressed its opinion on them? <Col N="439" /> Does the Minister of State not believe that this will be seen by everybody as laying the groundwork for the full release of these people?</P>

      <P>That it took so long to reach agreement on the draft treaty of Nice is perhaps no surprise given the fundamental importance of the decisions being taken. Each member state had its own priorities but, through long and arduous negotiations, we were able to achieve our mutual objectives of laying the base for the further enlargement of the European Union. I will return in detail to the Nice treaty in the second part of my statement, but I would like to begin by outlining briefly the decisions taken on the other issues which we dealt with over the first two days of the summit.</P>
      <P>The Council began on the morning of Thursday, 7 December, with a European conference with the applicant states. In the first working session of the Council, we formally proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights, took a number of important decisions on economic and social issues, security and defence matters, maritime safety and the establishment of the European Food Authority. We also considered the impact of recent developments on BSE on beef producers. As the House will be aware, subsequent working sessions continued throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday until 4.30 a.m. on Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European conference was a welcome opportunity to reassure the applicant states, <Col N="445" /> including Turkey, of the Union's determination to advance the enlargement process as soon as possible. It was imperative that, at Nice, EU leaders sent a positive message to assure the applicants that their difficult reform programmes would be rewarded by membership of the European Union in the near future. The greatest reassurance which was given was the successful conclusion of the intergovernmental conference because, through readying the Union, we have paved the way for enlargement to commence. Leaders endorsed the Commission's strategy paper on enlargement which outlined a road map for accession negotiations for the coming 18 months. It is now essential that we make a substantive leap forward in the negotiation process.</P>
    <P>Together with the European Parliament and Commission, the leaders formally proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights at Nice. For the first time the Union has brought together in a single comprehensive document the rights and freedoms to which the citizens of the Union are entitled. Fundamental rights have been, and will continue to be, a priority for the Irish Government and are, in most cases, already exceptionally well safeguarded in our Constitution. Importantly, from our perspective, it was agreed that further wide consultation would be undertaken as to the future status of the charter in the context of the declaration on the future of the Union.</P>
    <P>The European Council approved a Presidency report on European security and defence policy, including the outcome of the capabilities commitment conference. While this is a matter with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs will deal in greater detail in his statement, I was pleased the report respected the principle that any missions undertaken would be in accordance with the United Nations Charter. As I have previously stated, it is a sovereign decision for each member state to decide, on a case by case basis, whether to participate in a mission and we will only do so if it has a UN mandate. I am also particularly pleased with the emphasis in the report on developing civilian resources for crisis management.</P>
    <P>Agreement was also reached at Nice on a package of measures which the Presidency billed as helping to achieve a citizens' Europe. I fully endorsed the establishment of the European Food Authority by the start of 2002 as this is the most effective mechanism to address food safety requirements and restore public confidence. Leaders also endorsed the package of measures agreed by the Agriculture Council to combat BSE. I argued strongly that additional funding should be provided to compensate beef producers for the fall in prices. As a result, the Commission was mandated to analyse the situation confronting beef producers. The Commission will make such proposals as it considers necessary to the Agriculture Council as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> I gave my full support to the measures identified for reducing the risk of maritime accidents such as the sinking of the <i>Erika</i> oil tanker. I also joined with my colleagues in expressing regret at the failure to reach agreement at the climate change conference in The Hague, and I look forward to negotiations recommencing as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The European Council also considered a number of essentially economic and social issues. The special European Council held in Lisbon last March set for the Union the goal of becoming the most dynamic, knowledge based economy in the world by 2010 and to achieving greater social cohesion. The Nice Summit made further progress on reaching this goal by endorsing a new social agenda document that will guide the Union's policies in this area over the next five years. To ensure that social policy issues remain at the top of our agenda, a report will be submitted to the spring summit each year on the document's implementation.</P>
    <P>The Nice Summit also agreed on the format for the spring summit in Stockholm and I look forward to the publication of the Commission's synthesis report and of the high level structural indicators I see as a valuable input to the discussion of economic and social priorities at the spring Council.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to my main theme of the summit, namely, the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference. The entire Intergovernmental Conference process, which began under the Portuguese Presidency during the first six months of the year, had a clear purpose, namely, to prepare the institutions of the Union for enlargement. The agenda at the outset comprised the Amsterdam left-overs &ndash; the size and composition of the Commission, the reweighting of votes in the Council and the extension of qualified majority voting &ndash; as well as some related institutional issues. Flexibility, or enhanced co-operation as it is also known, was added to the agenda at the Feira European Council in June.</P>
    <P>During the process, I sought to ensure that the positions which Ireland was adopting on these issues were well known domestically. I believe that from our discussions in this House, from my major addresses on European policy, delivered in March and November to the IEA and ICEM, respectively, and from the debate which ministerial colleagues aroused, there was an unprecedented level of public awareness of the issues under discussion. It is clear that the Government approached the negotiations in a positive light and against the background of the priority we attach to the earliest possible enlargement of the Union. However, in doing so we also sought to ensure that the essential characteristics of the Union were maintained, including its delicate institutional balance. While we had clear priorities, such as the retention of our Commissioner for the foreseeable future and retaining unanimity for taxation, we also wanted to make a <Col N="447" /> genuine contribution to the construction of a Union adapted to the challenges it faces.</P>
    <P>While the real success of the Nice negotiations can only be assessed by taking the new draft treaty as a whole, before doing so I would like to comment on each inter-related issue in the overall package. A number of the larger member states were concerned about the ability of the Commission to undertake its tasks effectively with 27 or more members. On his tour of capitals, President Chirac had even suggested that a Commission of 12 to 14 members would be the best model to follow. However, from the outset we believed it essential that at the current stage of the Union's development, each member state, particularly new members, would retain the right to nominate a commissioner. We took this position for two reasons. First, we are committed to maintaining a strong Commission which would continue to be the fulcrum for the integration and expansion of the Union. Second, it is essential for the democratic legitimacy of the Union's institutions that national links with the Commission be maintained. Together with a number of partners, Ireland successfully resisted proposals to decide on a limit for the Commission. I argued we could not anticipate the nature of developments in the Union over the next decade and so could not now decide the shape of a suitable Commission. I also argued that, while I have always accepted that a Commission of more than 30 members would be almost impossible to manage, it is only after we have experience of a Commission of 23, 24 or 25 members, acting under the direction of a more powerful President, that we should take a final decision on the appropriate maximum figure.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I was very pleased to negotiate the final two-stage model in the draft treaty. First, there will be no change in the size of the Commission until 2005 at which time the larger member states will give up their second commissioner and, second, there will be a review when the Union reaches 27 members. The review will set a cap for the Commission of less than 27. It also provides, most importantly, that any rotation will be on the basis of strict equality among member states. This outcome reflects the position adopted by Ireland that any review should not be overly specific. We were also successful in our aim of significantly strengthening the powers of the Commission President.</P>
    <P>I am very satisfied with the outcome on the Commission which guarantees the Irish Government's right to nominate a Commissioner for the next decade or longer, depending on how soon one believes the Union will include 27 states, and to have secured the right to equal rotation, even with the largest member states thereafter.</P>
    <P>On the second related Amsterdam left-over, the reweighting of votes, we were open to any new model which would ensure that a qualified majority would require the support of a majority of states and a majority of the Union's popu<Col N="448" /> lation. However, we recognised the importance of this issue for the larger states, particularly Germany, fully accepting that those member states who give up a second Commissioner were entitled to expect appropriate compensation in the form of additional weighting.</P>
    <P>As I anticipated, reweighting turned out to be one of the most protracted and difficult parts of the negotiations. For existing member states the issues of absolute and relative weighting were important. A further complication was the need to decide on the voting weights for the applicant states. In Ireland's case, against the background of englargement, whereby all member states were set to lose voting weight, the outcome was very satisfactory. I am particularly pleased we maintained our ranking with Denmark and Finland, each having seven votes out of a total of 345 votes when we reach a Union of 27 states.</P>
    <P>In an enlarged EU of 27 or more members, a substantial decrease in the number of areas where unanimity would continue to apply was required, otherwise the day to day business of the Union would grind to a halt. In recognition of this, we adopted a strongly supportive position on the extension of QMV. In advance of Nice we made determined and successful efforts to reduce our list of exceptions to a minimum. As a result, the Union was able to agree to 30 Articles moving to QMV It is worth noting that, although not previously discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, we also agreed that in future the appointment of the President of the Commission would be subject to QMV.</P>
    <P>However, together with the UK, Sweden and Luxembourg, we continued to insist on retention of unanimity for all aspects of taxation. We took this view because it is simply not possible to ring-fence certain aspects of taxation or to pretend that changes in one area will not have an impact across the board. The right to choose freely how one will be taxed is a fundamental aspect of national sovereignty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to say that we held our line on this despite constant and heavy pressure from the Presidency to accept QMV. I also resisted applying QMV to anti-fraud measures because I genuinely believe that measures to tackle fraud are best adopted and applied on a co-operative basis with the full participation of all member states. The only way to achieve this is by unanimity.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the Intergovernmental Conference agreed to a proposal from Ireland to provide a clear legal base for the Union's social protection committee. We made this proposal to give further momentum to the work begun at Lisbon on social protection and felt that it had complemented the steps taken in relation to social exclusion at Amsterdam. Our proposal in this area is further evidence of the active role which Ireland has taken within the Union. As a mature member state with the Union average GNP <i>per capita</i>, the time has come for us to more actively shape policy in key areas of national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> The Amsterdam Treaty includes flexibility provisions for a majority of member states to undertake closer co-operation in specific policy areas. However, no actual flexibility arrangements were ever proposed due to the perceived restrictive nature of the provisions. While we ourselves were not advocates for change in this area, we listened to the concerns of our partners who wished to be able to move forward. Accordingly, I gave my support for an easing of the flexibility arrangements, provided they were used as a last resort only. I also attached particular importance to confirming a role for the Commission and explicitly excluding the Single Market from the scope of closer co-operation. The draft Treaty reflects these concerns and I was satisfied to accept the proposal for eight to remain as the minimum number for participation across the Three Pillars. The Treaty also allows for the implementation of flexibility procedures on the basis of QMV.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Government was cautious in its approach to proposals to extend the application of flexibility unconditionally to the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy. We believe that the strength of the EU in this area lies in its unity and coherence. Member states have worked hard to develop the CFSP, including the European security and defence policy on the basis of the 15 working together. In the interests of securing an overall package, I accepted that, under certain conditions, closer co-operation could apply to implementation of an already agreed joint action or common position but closer co-operation could not apply to measures having military or defence implications.</P>
    <P>As regards the European Parliament, we recognised that all member states had to play their part in accommodating new member states. However, it was imperative that the burden be shared on an equitable basis among member states. The proposal from the European Parliament could have involved a drop to nine MEPs for Ireland and was not acceptable. I argued that an alternative approach, which took account of the need to ensure meaningful representation from all states, was essential. This view prevailed and within a slightly higher ceiling of 732 members, I am satisfied with an outcome that will leave us with 12 MEPs in an enlarged Union. This figure is at the very top of the range signalled in negotiations prior to the summit.</P>
    <P>At Nice, we also agreed essentially structural changes to the working methods and composition of the Courts of Justice and of First Instance, the Court of Auditors, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, which will prepare them for an increase in the size of the Union. In the context of the overall agreement, these changes are broadly acceptable to us. Leaders also agreed to a declaration dealing with the process for taking forward issues such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Catalogue of Competencies, the inter-relationship between <Col N="451" /> national parliaments and the Union and the restructuring of the Treaties.</P>
    <P>We mandated the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies to initiate preliminary consideration of the agenda and the modalities by which it would be taken forward. At the conclusion of a fully inclusive consultation process there will be a further declaration at the EU Council in December 2001 under the Belgian Presidency which will provide a road map for the work to be carried out by way of preparation for a new conference that will be convened in 2004.</P>
    <P>While fully supporting the declaration, we insisted that it should contain specific assurances that it would not provide any additional barriers to the accession of the applicant states.</P>
    <P>As to whether a referendum will be required to ratify the Treaty over the coming weeks at Union level, lawyers and linguists will seek to reproduce in precise and consistent legal language the decisions taken at Nice. A decision on the referendum can be taken only on the basis of legal advice when the final text is available and examined in relation to the scope of the current constitutional provisions. As I have already indicated, my feeling is that a referendum will be necessary and I would be happy to put the outcome to the people, even if there is some doubt about whether it is actually required.</P>
    <P>In advance of Nice, I met Austrian Chancellor, Mr. Wolfgang Schussel, Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt and French President, Mr. Jacques Chirac, as part of his pre-Nice tour of capitals to discuss the issues arising at the summit. In addition, senior officials in my office maintained close contacts with their counterparts in other capitals in the final run-up to the summit. I also held bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Blair during the summit and maintained close contact with him during the course of the negotiations. In addition to the Intergovernmental Conference, we discussed a range of issues related to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Nice Summit marks the conclusion of the French Presidency. Significant progress was made across a broad range of areas, including the holding of the EU-Balkans Summit in Zagreb, enlargement, the resolution of the long standing tax package and many other issues on which agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>On the Intergovernmental Conference specifically, while I admit the negotiations in Nice were exhausting, the issues under discussion were of such fundamental importance for the future of the Union that nobody would have thanked us for taking the necessary decisions lightly or for avoiding difficult issues. President Chirac can feel proud that he managed to broker an agreement among the many competing member state positions.</P>
    <P>In line with the new policy of even deeper engagement with the Oireachtas on European affairs, which I announced in November, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will also report on <Col N="452" /> the Nice Treaty to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs at the earliest convenient date.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister, Deputy Cowen, Mr. Noel Dorr, the Government's representative to the Intergovernmental Conference, and all of the staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments, including my own, and the Attorney General's office, whose dedicated work over the past year contributed to the successful outcome for Ireland. I would particularly like to thank the staff of those offices, the secretarial staff in particular, who effectively worked for three nights on the trot, with the exception of a few hours. Clerical and secretarial staff who do that should be complimented for their enormous dedication, particularly when it was not expected they would have to work those hours.</P>
    <P>While some media reports have cast the Nice outcome as one of victory for Ireland in terms of the retention of the Commissioner, the retention of unanimity on taxation matters, the number of MEPs we secured and the explicit exclusion of military and defence matters from the new enhanced co-operation procedures, I would rather consider the Nice Treaty as a victory for the Union and the applicant states.</P>
    <P>Ireland's progressive approach throughout the negotiations, for instance, in areas such as QMV, helped to make a real contribution to the substance of the Nice Treaty and, ultimately, to the construction of a more dynamic Union. While Ireland belongs to the Union, through our shaping of the Union over the last quarter of a century, the people of Ireland can genuinely claim that the Union belongs to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was Taoiseach and President of the Council of the European Union, I made it clear to all with whom I dealt that I would not accept, in any circumstances, the removal of Ireland's right to a European Commissioner. That right has now been conceded by my successor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That the Taoiseach would have the lack of self-knowledge to quote media reports describing the outcome of Nice as a victory for Ireland, media reports I can only regard as sycophantic, shows how little in touch he is with what he did. He conceded that Ireland, at a point in the determinate rather than the indeterminate future, will have no Commissioner. He will be remembered for that for a long time. He will be remembered for many good things but when the time comes, as it will, that Ireland has no Commissioner for five years, people will remember that it was Deputy Ahern, as Taoiseach, and Deputy Cowen, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, who sold the pass for Ireland as far as a Commissioner is concerned. It will be for those five years that they will be remembered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> I would not have agreed to that and I speak as someone who is passionately in favour of further European integration and who has no backward look about Ireland pooling its sovereignty with others. I have always believed that it is essential we have a Commissioner and I said so clearly to my friends in the European People's Party and to those of other parties, particularly socialist parties, who were members of the European Council with me. Whatever we would concede, we would not concede that but it has been conceded by my successor.</P>
    <P>It was conceded at a time when he also conceded a reduction in the number of MEPs Ireland would have and a proportionate reduction in the number of votes Ireland would have on the Council of Ministers. This is one of the weakest negotiating outcomes achieved by an Irish Government in the European forum since Ireland joined the Union and it is a direct result of the fact that Fianna Fáil has no friends in Europe and has not cultivated any friends in Europe. Fianna Fáil is a party seen as being provisionally in Europe in terms of its emotional commitment.</P>
    <P>The Commission loss is a serious blow because the Commission is the originator of all legislative and other proposals. The Commission alone has the power of initiative and initiatives, if they are to be taken in a legal area, must be taken on the basis of a degree of political acceptance. While I am strongly in favour of European federalism I recognise that Europe is a union of states also and that Ireland is one of those states. There will not be the same level of Irish acceptance of proposals emanating from a Commission which has no Irish Commissioner.</P>
    <P>That is not the only negative outcome of the compromise accepted in Nice. A time will come when there will be no German Commissioner and 90 million Germans will not be represented by a Commissioner for five years. That will happen as a result of the Nice outcome. It may not be of much concern to those who have presented the outcome as, to use the Taoiseach's quote from a sycophantic media, &ldquo;a victory for Ireland&rdquo; but people should reflect on how they expect the European Commission to work in terms of having the support it needs for the institution which has the sole power to take initiatives, the Commission itself, if the largest nation, Germany, is not represented among the 27 Commissioners around the table. There will not be one German Commissioner and, at another time, not one Irish Commissioner. Does anyone believe that would work?</P>
    <P>The only way this will work is if the Commission ceases to matter and if we move towards intergovernmentalism. If the Commission is to have the sole power of initiative it must represent everyone. As a result of Nice and its late night compromises, the Commission will now operate, at all times after a date not too far away, on the basis that some countries will not be represented on the Commission. That is not tenable and the only way it will be politically acceptable will be if <Col N="454" /> the Commission ceases to be the influential body it has to be.</P>
    <P>The reason for the success of the European Union is the unique institution of the Commission. There is no precedent in constitution building or federations elsewhere for an institution like the Commission. It is a body that is semi-political and semi-non-political, it is representative yet above national politics and it has the sole power of initiative, a power it does not share with anyone else. That is the engine that has made the Union work and by agreeing to a situation in which the Commission will no longer have some countries represented there, the Commission has been eviscerated. That is a very bad day for Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of self-congratulatory atmosphere people exist in at meetings like this but I do not doubt the Taoiseach sincerely believes he had a triumph in Nice, as does the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will no doubt robustly claim the same. However, they are not living in the real world. It is not realistic to think the Germans will accept a Commission proposal in which there will be no German hand. It is not real to think that Irish people will accept with the same alacrity a Commission proposal in which there is no Irish hand.</P>
    <P>It has been truthfully stated that one of the outcomes of Nice was to enhance the position of the bigger States in decision making. As Reuters put it &ldquo;The main outcome was to increase the weight of the four big countries, Germany, Britain, France and Italy&rdquo;. At a time when the European Union is being enlarged to take in a lot of small countries, some of which already doubt whether they should join, what sense does it make to increase the voting strength of the big countries? Very little.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may feel, as other Members do, that it was right to make a sacrifice on the Commission and to make a big stand, at least for the optics, on taxation. That was not the right order of priority. The proposal, for instance, to allow QMV in regard to fraud in tax does not threaten anybody. No nation state in the European Union, that is a true European state, would be willing to see its national status used to defraud the revenues of other European treasuries. Why should there not be the possibility of at least majority voting with regard to fraud? Bear in mind that we have had a very expensive tribunal of inquiry in this jurisdiction because our own authorities could not detect fraud in the beef industry. Fraud is widespread in Europe. It undermines the citizen's confidence in the European Union and needs to be acted upon decisively, firmly and vigorously. It should not be possible for one country to prevent the rest of the Union acting on fraud in the tax area, particularly where one country could actually benefit through fraud being committed against the treasuries of other countries. That is why there is a reasonable case for looking favourably enough at the concept that there should be majority rather than unanimity with <Col N="455" /> regard to decisions on tax. If there was a trade-off and the Taoiseach had a choice, to dig his heels in on holding our commissioner or on allowing qualified majority voting in regard to tax fraud and he chose to dig his heels in to require unanimity on majority voting on tax fraud and to sell the pass on the commissioner, then he made the wrong choice. He made the wrong choice for Ireland and Europe and a political mistake of serious magnitude.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this matter. I wish to share what remains of my time with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. However, I am deeply disappointed with this outcome. It would not be fair, although he is the person who is here and has to take the rap, to lay all the blame for this very poor outcome on the shoulders of either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs. They were only one of 15 delegations present. However, it is obvious that the preparation for the summit by the French Presidency was less than it ought to have been in its thoroughness. It would appear that the French are good at talking but not so good at listening, they do not hear what is said and they produce compromises which, if they had been listening to what had been said, they would know were not compromises at all. That may be to do with internal politics in France over which we have no control here. Be that as it may, this was a bad four days' work.</P>

      <P>Today the Taoiseach reports to the House that he is very satisfied with the outcome on the Commission which guarantees the Irish Government's right to nominate a commissioner for the next decade or longer. He tells us that he and his delegation had clear priorities at the Nice Summit &ldquo;such as the retention of our Commissioner for the foreseeable future&rdquo;. The Taoiseach is revising and rewriting history. What were the priorities established by this Government in relation to Nice? I can only quote his own words. The Taoiseach in a major statement he made in Dublin Castle last month made it quite clear that &ldquo;in our view, it is essential that we agree at Nice that each member state retain the right to nominate a commissioner.&rdquo;  He established the priority in clear and unequivocal terms. How he can now come in and tell us he is satisfied with a result that involves us losing that automatic right, is beyond me. Deputy Bruton also mentioned the issue of other major member states not having the right in the future to nominate a commissioner. That also was covered by the Taoiseach in his Dublin Castle speech. He said &ldquo;Very frankly, however, I would fear for the authority and credibility of the Commission in a period where, for example, there was no French or German &ndash; or, indeed, Polish &ndash; Commissioner.&rdquo;  These are the words of the Taoiseach. Yet that is the very deal to which he agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that what came from Nice, from the Irish camp, has been a great deal of posturing, <Col N="456" /> PR effort and phoney wars on issues which were not issues at all. Whether that was purely because the Taoiseach was trying to give the impression of fighting the good fight or because he took his eye off the ball, I am not sure at this stage. However, he requires to give an explanation to the House. I have no doubt that the outcome at Nice was achieved at very considerable cost to this country. There was a cost in the loss of our automatic right to a commissioner and in relation to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>On that matter, apart from the loss of three seats for us, which possibly will focus on Leinster and Munster &ndash; I am not sure where the third one will go &ndash; before the summit I also asked that particular attention be paid to the situation in Northern Ireland. As of now, although it is not in our quota, there are three seats in Northern Ireland out of the current allocation to the UK. I am concerned that in the reduced allocation to the UK, there should still be three seats in Northern Ireland. We have had no report on that. Do we consider this country at all just beyond our own borders? I asked that that issue be looked at. It has not even been touched on. Has there been any arrangement or discussion with the UK authorities on that issue, which is of importance to this island?</P>
    <P>On the question of the cost to us, as a small member state, perhaps the real loss is the dilution of our voting strength at Council of Ministers level. No matter now one dresses it up, there is a huge dilution because there is now a permanent shift in the balance of power at Council of Ministers level, away from the smaller member states like ourselves, to the larger member states. The Taoiseach could explain and defend all these matters but to come back and suggest that this is an outcome for which he deserves an enormous clap on the back is something which I cannot accept.</P>
    <P>I am hugely concerned that with the media focus on the great fight on taxation, the reality of the situation was not touched on. That was, in many ways, a phoney war. In a situation where the UK, in particular, made it absolutely clear that it would not, under any circumstances, accept any change on the issue of taxation, how was it that we spent so much time having to focus on that? Having read the international media on this issue, the name of Ireland as a potent issue was only entered in as an afterthought, coat-tailing on the UK. How is it that the Irish media approach was that the Taoiseach was spending his time fighting that issue, when what was happening was that we were building up the huge cost to us on the institutions as already detailed?</P>
    <P>I have just one other concern at this stage. The Taoiseach in his speech talks about the unprecedented level of public awareness. I challenge that. Many months ago I pointed out the need for a high level of public awareness because of the probable need for a referendum to ratify any treaty that would be agreed. I challenge the Taoiseach on the issue of public awareness. If one wants to use the phrase &ldquo;what people are dis<Col N="457" /> cussing before their breakfast&rdquo;, I doubt that qualified majority voting is high on the agenda. My concern is that there is a very low level of awareness, and responsibility for that lies with this Government. The Government should have been aware of the need for a much greater public consultation in a situation where it may be necessary to convince the people that this treaty should be accepted on a constitutional basis.</P>
    <P>The Government should have been aware of the need for much greater public consultation, particularly where it may be necessary to convince people that the treaty should be accepted on a constitutional basis. No great marks are due to the Government on its negotiations. It was not a game that was well played.</P>

      <P>It gives me no great pleasure to say that what was agreed and conceded by the Taoiseach and the delegation he led, no matter how well intentioned, and I do not doubt the goodness of his intentions, was a travesty. I agree with what has already been said. No doubt the Taoiseach felt under pressure in respect of the real issue. I have said consistently the taxation issue was a Trojan horse, a phoney war, set up to draw the Taoiseach's fire and he gave it all. It was never going to happen. The Taoiseach and I spent time on the ECOFIN Council and we know the strength of feeling about unanimity in respect of taxation. It was a target set up for the Taoiseach to fire at and, having fired successfully, he felt obliged to concede.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a disaster. That was my first reaction. The Taoiseach could have stopped this. I know, given the isolation of the Taoiseach's party &ndash; I say that in a factual rather than an observational or political sense because this is more about the part and parcel of politics &ndash; it was a long, hard four days and his staff were under considerable pressure. However, he could have consulted Deputy Bruton who has links as vice-president of the European People's Party or me as vice-president of the Party of European Socialists. He would have had the comfort of knowing in the councils in Nice that he had support for holding the line he enunciated in Dublin Castle. Time will march quickly and we may find ourselves in the future blocking the enlargement beyond 27 so as to ensure member states have a commissioner, but that would not be right. We do not yet know the final legal text of the treaty but a major concession was made which cannot, with the knowledge we have at present, be replaced or put back on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why the Taoiseach chose to concede on what he recognised was a fundamental issue is inexplic<Col N="458" /> able. He has, in part, built his entire political reputation around his ability to negotiate and extract a good deal when it seemed, on occasion, impossible to find. However, he did not do it in Nice. As a result, not only will Ireland's interests be damaged but those of every small State because the concession made by the Taoiseach and others, which he could have blocked, means that he has irreparably damaged the role and function of the Commission. Therefore, he has damaged the interest of every other country in the European Union, big and small. When history is written about what happened in Nice it will be said that was the point at which the spirit of the founding fathers during the Coal and Steel Treaty, the Treaty of Rome and the unique creation of Schuman, Monnet and De Gasperi was neutered in a particular way. None of us can prophesy the future or determine what the outcome is likely to be but, as a result of what was conceded in Nice, the debate in this country on the future development of Europe will change dramatically. I regret that.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Bruton, I share a passionate commitment to the European project, the idea of enlargement and the construction of a platform of permanent peace in Europe. But it will not come about through some new form of European inter-governmentalism. We have started down that slippery slope. We have been there before. Perhaps in architectural terms, one of the most aesthetic monuments to European inter-governmentalism of the past 300 years stands in the centre of Paris, the Arc d'Triomphe. It was because of the list of battles on that monument and other monuments across continental Europe and on this island, North and South, that the unique role of the Commission became the key stone in that delicate arch that is the European project. I do not know why the Taoiseach conceded or why he was conned into going for the Trojan horse, the phoney target of taxation. But conned he was and I regret that. The time will come when he, too, will regret it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Taoiseach is saying there must be a referendum and that, on balance, he has moved to the Labour Party position, which was not conceded earlier, that irrespective of the legal advice &ndash; I have heard the political view expressed professionally and diplomatically by people in the Department of Foreign Affairs giving their personal view that a referendum should not be held unless it is strictly legally necessary &ndash; there is now a swing by the Taoiseach, if I detect it correctly, in political terms towards a referendum. This is not over. We do not know if the European Parliament will ratify this treaty. We know that the Belgian and Italian parliaments will refuse to ratify it if it is not ratified by the European Parliament. We have a long way to go on this issue.</P>
    <P>There is nothing particularly wrong with a delay other than &ndash; this is the difficult position into which the Taoiseach has put people like myself and others who support clarity with respect to enlargement &ndash; that it will be a slap <Col N="459" /> in the face to applicant countries, the democratic Governments that are attempting to take the painful path away from command economies not having a tradition of democracy, towards requiring their citizens to climb the very high mountain of <i>acquis communitaire</i>. It is much higher than when we joined the European Union and much more difficult in a globalised economy than anything we had to confront after 1973.</P>
    <P>I am torn between the difficulties of ensuring that process of painful and difficult progress, whether it be in Hungary, Poland, Estonia or Slovenia, and am acutely aware of the geo-political position in which those countries find themselves and the imperative they require to convince their citizens to take painful measures. We had that through the 1980s. It is particularly difficult when there is an Opposition that is saying to those people that health cuts hurt the old, weak and sick, which is what is happening in those countries at present. Not every Opposition in every parliament is as constructive as the one the Taoiseach confronts. He has made our task, as well as his position, extremely difficult by the sell out in relation to his declared position in Dublin Castle less than four or five weeks ago. Why did he do it? I would like Deputy Cowen to answer that. I respect the ability of both the Taoiseach and the Minister on this matter and their overall political ability. Yet, it is inexplicable that they agreed to this.</P>
    <P>There are many other things in relation to the Intergovernmental Conference and its outcome &ndash; we have to await the text to see what precisely is written into it &ndash; and, indeed, the summit. Many good things have come from it and I acknowledge those. However, they are absolutely secondary to the core issue of what we are talking about. It is imperative that the Taoiseach clarifies why he conceded on his own declared principle. What does the Taoiseach envisage will now happen? Does the Taoiseach think this treaty will go through right across the 15 member states? Does he expect it to be ratified by the Parliament in Strasbourg? The groups which will decide to ratify it will not be influenced by the voice of Fianna Fáil in the European Parliament, and that for us, in some respects, is a difficulty as well.</P>
    <P>I am confident that had the rainbow coalition been in Government, this treaty would not have been accepted by us last weekend. It is an appalling set-back. I am not sure where we will go from here in respect of it. The Taoiseach has created the mess and the difficulty and he has sold his own negotiating standing point. I await with interest to hear his explanation because this is the beginning of a debate the parameters and the profile of which are as yet very unclear. That is not to do injustice to the many other things in the conclusions.</P>
    <P>I would say &ndash; this is not a reflection on either of the two gentlemen representing the Government or on the people in Iveagh House &ndash; that one thing is emerging very clearly, we need much <Col N="460" /> more staff in Iveagh House and much more resources for the Department of Foreign Affairs. We need an accelerated programme of creation of new embassies within the applicant countries which we do not have them. At last we have the resource to do this. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs know that I am not making this point for the first time. I am saying, in the light of the major mistake to concede on this point, that the necessity to strengthen and enlarge the resources available to whoever happens to be in Government is an absolute imperative and that has to be informed by a presence in all the capital cities of the applicant countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le Páirtí an Lucht Oibre agus lena cheannaire, Ruairí Quinn, as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. Given that we have only been able to read the Treaty of Nice in French, the Green Party is not only disappointed but alarmed at the outcome of the Nice Council and the treaty. We are alarmed at the erosion of basic principles such as democracy and transparency, at the increased centralisation of power in a few big countries, at the extension of qualified majority voting and the elimination of Ireland's veto in over 30 new areas and at the beginnings of a two tier Europe because of new flexibility rules allowing sub-groups of states to proceed on certain issues.</P>
      <P>The Green Party is, as the House well knows, strongly opposed to the militarisation of the EU, to the development of the European reaction force as a result of the last EU treaty and the establishment of permanent military committees and structures in the EU.</P>
      <P>Nice was supposed to assist EU enlargement, correcting the failures in Amsterdam to facilitate the accession of new states. It is not clear how the proposals put forward in Nice will greatly help the EU applicant countries, but they have certainly harmed a number of the current EU members, including Ireland. The real beneficiaries are the big countries, Germany, Britain and France, in particular. The reweighting of votes means that Ireland's voice in the Council of Ministers has been greatly weakened while the big three will be able to form what is effectively, according to yesterday's <i>The Guardian,</i> a directly &ldquo;able to block virtually anything they want as the enlargement process gets under way&rdquo;. Meanwhile, not only has Ireland's position been weakened in the Council of Ministers but Ireland will also lose three MEPs in the Parliament and our automatic right to a Commissioner.</P>
      <P>This has been an onslaught on democracy. There is already a severe democratic deficit in the EU. Now the EU institutions will be even more remote from the people. The European Parliament, the most democratic institution in the EU, will not only have three fewer MEPs directly elected by the people, but it will not be given co-decision powers for all the new areas to which qualified majority voting has been extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> The approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is also extremely worrying from a civil liberties point of view and is viewed by many as an embryonic constitution for the evolving EU super state, something which the Green Party opposes. The Green Party would be greatly concerned that this charter is undermining the Council of Europe and the Council's European Convention on Human Rights. We believe that instead of reinventing the wheel, the EU should be acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>We also believe that the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights is a misnomer. It should be renamed the charter of conditional rights because Article 52 contains a highly dangerous clause negating all the rights that have gone before. The article states that any and all freedoms might be limited, even suspended, in the name of the general interest of the Union. This raises a horrifying spectre.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate the Green Party's total rejection of the EU's Petersberg Tasks, the rapid reaction force established to carry them out and all the military hardware committee structures that have been put in place by the EU. At what point does crisis management, peacekeeping and peace enforcement turn into warfare? Despite what the Government says, this rapid reaction force is undermining the United Nations. Nowhere in any EU treaty does it state that this force requires a UN mandate. That is because it is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Government may say that Irish troops legally require a UN mandate, but lawyers whom we have consulted say that this is highly debatable. The Green Party believes that the Government should insert a protocol into the Nice Treaty, comparable to the one Denmark has in the Amsterdam Treaty, exempting Ireland from involvement in EU military efforts. In addition, we want an amendment to the Constitution stating that Irish troops cannot serve abroad without a UN mandate. Let us make it a constitutional requirement.</P>
    <P>We are also very concerned at the influence of NATO on these new EU defence structures. It is interesting that Tony Blair argues that this is not a euro-army being developed because the rapid reaction force will be relying on NATO and can only operate with NATO's permission. This, however, should not be satisfactory to the leaders of a neutral country. I wonder how long it will be before we hear from the Taoiseach what the people from neutral Sweden are now hearing from their Prime Minister that the days of neutrality are numbered.</P>
    <P>The Green Party would welcome a referendum on the Nice Treaty. It would be the ultimate in undemocratic behaviour to deny such a referendum. We look forward to putting these issues and many more to the people. Ireland is losing MEPs, its veto and its ability through its MEPs to have an additional say on the qualified majority voting areas which include areas such as international trade agreements covering most services, investments and intellectual property rights, a <Col N="462" /> move which will harm developing countries and increase the destructive tendencies of globalisation. We will be affected by asylum and immigration issues and justice and homes affairs. These issues do not seem to have been given the full airing and debate they need. I hope when the treaty text comes out, we will have more time to debate these issues in greater detail with the full weight and knowledge of legal opinion to deal with them in full.</P>

      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate. I am glad to take up some of the questions which have been raised. Deputy Bruton made the point that he was prepared to veto the Treaty of Nice on the basis that the right to a Commissioner was not being made available for all time. That was his clear position. Deputy Bruton suggests that he knows how to win his friends in Europe on the basis of vetoing the Treaty of Nice on that issue. I would say to him that is probably the most naive comment I have ever heard him make. Even sorrier than that is that Deputy Bruton went on to conduct&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke very highly about his Presidency of the European Council. He had that privilege and the very best of luck to him on that. He also went on to say that the Commission has the sole right of initiative. That is not correct. Whether he is President of the European Council, leader of the Fine Gael Party or vice-president of the European People's Party and thinks that is the situation in relation to the treaties we were negotiating, I am afraid it shows an enormous lack of knowledge about what are the institutional capacities. I will tell him why because it is not the sole right of initiative, it is fundamentally correct. Therefore the Deputy's argument is based on a totally inaccurate assessment and understanding of what is the Commission's capacity or what is the capacity of the Council of Ministers. An initiative can be taken by member states without reference to the Commission. It requires two thirds of the member states and a qualified majority vote procedure for that initiative to be passed by the Council, without any direct input by the Commission. If we are to have a debate on where the Commission goes for the future, let us display some rudimentary understanding and knowledge of the issues. That is a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Commission works and its relationship with the Council. On that basis alone, I dismiss Deputy Bruton's argument because he has shown a basic misunderstanding of what the treaties contain. I cannot <Col N="463" /> be more blunt than that. The Deputy is suggesting that by his Europeanism he would win more friends for Ireland by vetoing the Treaty of Nice. That is his contention here in the House because when one strips away the rhetoric and the cant, that is what is left.</P>

      <P>We held a hard negotiating line on each of the elements up for debate, as is our job, throughout the whole intergovernmental conference meeting. We then went to the intergovernmental conference on the basis of the options that were to be put by the Presidency. No country emerged from the Nice negotiations having maintained in every respect every negotiating position they held on all the issues. Had they done so, we would not have a Treaty of Nice. <Col N="464" /> Those are the facts. It is easy when one does not have the responsibility to step back and say to me that this, that and the other was a failure. We take the negotiating package as a whole and as such it was a successful outcome. It had as successful an outcome for Ireland as any other country can claim for itself. More importantly, regardless of whether Members like it, it represents the consensus that was negotiated among those 15 member states in Nice during those four days.</P>

I listened to what Deputy O'Keeffe had to say and if he wants to contend, as is his luxury in opposition, that his Leader would veto the Treaty of Nice on the basis of that issue, that is fine. Let the people know that, it is articulated and understood. I ask the Deputy not to come into the House in the future and talk about his commitment to the European project again because at the end of the day that assessment had to be made in those negotiations.</P>
      <P>On what people have said in relation to the Deputy's partners who are heads of state and Deputy Quinn's partners who are heads of state, Socialists or Christian Democrats, the Irish delegation fought that negotiating principle harder than any.

      <P>If there are people who are prepared to step back and say, &ldquo;No, we will maintain our own national interest in every respect, regardless of the common European interest that emerges in the consensus&rdquo;, that is fine. They have that luxury. Let there be no doubt that the Commission did not hold to the position articulated by us throughout these negotiations. We have fought tooth and nail a rearguard action from many states and the Commission on this issue. People wonder why we did not get an outcome that would not prejudge the review. At the end of the day we ended up at a position where we had to look at the whole negotiating package available to us. That is the political reality. There was an alternative in relation to the Benelux question where Guy Verhofstadt negotiated tremendously well for his interest. At the end of the day a compromise had to be reached and the Belgian <Col N="465" /> delegation decided to go forward on that issue. They were very disappointed on QMV issues, for example. Let us not suggest that on the one hand there are ten small member states all with a common interest in every issue and on the other there is the big five. That is not the reality.</P>

We can pander to a stereotype or we can deal with the facts. Overall we got a package which was part of a consensus that was hard won.

It is based on trying to reach common positions which, of course, involve defending national interests, but are not exclusively so. I look forward to the new year when we can debate this matter in greater detail. I look forward also to the debate on Friday on the foreign affairs committee.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 47, after &ldquo;Fund&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall only be used for the development of training within the sector from which the levy was collected&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had detailed discussion on this on Committee Stage. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, said he would look at the case we had made and return to us on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>In a nutshell, we are talking about the moneys collected to date from separate levies which were to be used for training in the construction industry or other relevant sectors. That money is now being amalgamated into an overall pool. We want the moneys collected to date to be ring-fenced until they are spent. We are not talking here about any new moneys that come into the fund. The Minister should accept the amendment in order to show commitment to the industries from which those funds were collected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment. Overnight my Department carried out a detailed analysis of the surplus funds held by FÁS from the levy and grant scheme. The facts are very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The surplus levy funds held by FÁS have been reducing very slowly. At the end of 1999 surplus funds held by FÁS from the levy grant scheme amounted to £11.2 million. This compares to a <Col N="467" /> surplus of £11.7 million at the end of 1997. The amount of surplus funds committed for grants to employers' industrial training projects at the end of 1999 was £5.6 million.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the payments made from the fund in recent years shows that, on average, payments amounted to less than 70% shown as committed at the end of the previous year. It is reasonable to assume this trend will continue. Therefore, we expect that only about £4 million of the current £11 million surplus will actually be spent. This £4 million will include a sum of approximately £2 million for the administration of FÁS schemes.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will be interested to know that over the past four years payments to FÁS for the administration of the levy grant scheme have amounted to between 45% and 58% of all expenditure from the levy grants fund. He may be further interested to learn that payments for administration have exceeded payments made to training projects in two of the past three years. For instance, payments for industrial training projects in 1999 amounted to £1.88 million. The administration payment to FÁS in 1999 amounted to £2.071 million.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the construction sector received £1.77 million for training projects, but the sector only contributed £11,000 in levies. The food, drink and tobacco sector received £3,000 for training projects, but contributed £746,000 in levies. In the same year, four of the seven sectors covered by the levy grant scheme received £3,000 or less for training. The print and paper sector contributed only £3,000 in levies but received £18,000 for training projects.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute the need for training in all sectors of industry, including those not covered by the levy grant scheme. I recognise, also, that the construction sector has been paying the apprenticeship levy since 1994, which explains the low yield from the sector under the levy grant scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled amendments Nos. 4 and 9 in response to Deputy Rabbitte's amend<Col N="468" /> ment, which was inserted on Committee Stage. As with Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, this amendment addresses the issue of consultation. I also believe this amendment addresses amendment No. 6, which is now proposed by Deputy Naughten.</P>
      <P>My concern with the wording inserted by Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is that it ties consultation to the making of payments from the fund. As indicated on Committee Stage, this would be enormously unwieldly. As drafted, every payment from the fund would require such consultation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in our discussions with the social partners, they indicated that they are not anxious to exercise a fiduciary role in relation to the fund. Their real concerns lie in having an opportunity to have a voice in the overall direction of national training policy and strategy and to ensure that the policies and programmes pursued reflect their needs.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that I intend to establish a national training advisory committee to address this issue. In this amendment I am providing that the Bill will specifically provide for consultation with employer and employee representatives in relation to the fund. I envisage this consultation taking place within the context of the proposed national training advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was taken unawares by the expedition with which the previous issue was put through the House. I wanted to indicate that my amendment No. 1 has been met by the Minister. That probably indicates that Committee Stage is still valuable in identifying a flaw in a Bill. The Minister's amendment of last night corrects that flaw.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendments in the Minister's name, the slight modification of the amendment agreed to on Committee Stage, as now advanced, meets the purpose I was seeking to achieve and I do not dispute its restationing in the Bill. It would in some circumstances be impracticable if every disbursement from the fund, no matter how small, had to be the subject of consultation with representatives of both sides of industry. The Minister's amendment will involve the appropriate representatives in the manner I had intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it is her intention to establish an advisory committee. Will she elaborate on the role of the committee and who is likely to comprise it? Her amendment differs from the one in my name on Committee Stage, which was accepted. That amendment referred to consultation with such organisations as appear to the Minster to be generally representative of employers and employees. The Minister's amendment refers to &ldquo;with such representatives of employees and such representatives of employers as he or she considers appropriate.&rdquo; Will there be an overlap between the person the Minister might <Col N="469" /> consider appropriate and those likely to end up on the advisory committee?</P>
    <P>I deliberately omitted inserting IBEC and the ICTU in my amendment. We dealt with this on Committee Stage. If it is a matter to do with the building industry there is not much point talking to anybody other than the CIF and the building group of unions. I presume that is what the Minister intends. I am not unhappy with what is being proposed here. Will there be an overlap between the membership of the advisory committee that will advise the Minster of the day and, if so, will there be an overlap between that and the persons contemplated by the amendments she proposes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 in the name of the Minister provides that &ldquo;the Minister shall, from time to time, consult with such representatives of employees and such representatives of employers as she considers appropriate.&rdquo; It is good to see a proposal to give recognition in the Bill to employers and employees. On Committee Stage we debated the problem associated with the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;. The Minister of State gave a commitment to proposing an amendment referring to an advisory committee. He appears, however, to have overlooked his commitment to consider a number of amendments for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Beyond the terms of this legislation there is no commitment to consultation. Amendment No. 6 in my name proposes an insertion to section 7. It would ensure that when a scheme referred to is established and funding from the National Training Fund is provided, consultation would take place with organisations generally representative within that sector. This is a fair amendment. It does not put any additional burden on the Minister of the day and I ask the Minister to accept it. The amendment is similar to amendment No. 9 in her name, except that it seeks to ensure that consultations take place. It deals with the issue raised on Committee Stage that the legislation marginalises the trade unions and contradicts the life long learning element of the PPF. While I accept amendment No. 9, amendment No. 6 strengthens its provisions with regard to the new programmes and schemes to be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the National Training Advisory Committee is to have workers' representatives, the ICTU, employers' representatives and, I hope, independent expertise in the training area. That is important. Enormous work has been done by the established expert skills groups in recent years. Some individuals on them are not directly involved as employers and employees but would have much to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to consultation, it is not the intention that there would be separate consultations before money is allocated to a programme. Many of the applications to the fund will be made by FÁS. The board of FÁS is representative of employers and employees, including on the employers' side the construction industry and on the employees' side employees across the board, especially those from the apprenticeship area. Other representations will come from Skillnets, <Col N="470" /> which was established as a joint employees-employers led approach to training at ground or sectoral level. That is very much a consultative approach.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind to this. If new initiatives are to be taken it would be natural to consult the interested parties, as happens all the time in this area. However, I do not want a situation to arise where no money can be allocated from the fund for training purposes unless specific consultation takes place. That would be unwieldy and impossible and those involved would find themselves in a very difficult position. The amendment in my name marries as best it can the views put forward by Deputies Rabbitte and Naughten. It is a good amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten is more keen to keep the industrial training committees. I would not be keen to do that for a host of reasons. Some sectors, such as the retail sector and the services area, have no industrial training committee, where training would be important. The approach taken in the Bill is modern and flexible. It is important that greater emphasis is placed on the need for upskilling, training and lifelong learning across all sectors in our society, including all industrial sectors. The establishment of this fund and the ring-fencing of a proportion of the moneys paid through employers' PRSI for a national training fund will be of enormous help in focusing on the new needs of the economy, which are very much training based, especially in some of the more traditional sectors.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the industrial training committees. Perhaps she might get a briefing from one of her officials regarding the content of the debate on Committee Stage because I did not say what she said I did. I said there was a need within the services industry.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the protection of a consultation process. Sadly it appears the Minister's Department is still unaware of the argument made by Deputy Rabbitte and me. It is a huge disappointment to note the Minister's assertion, despite my spending four hours on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) The scheme referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> shall receive the approval of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this amendment in great detail on Committee Stage yesterday. There should be a role for the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland in the dispersal of funding from the new fund. The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the two awarding councils must not only become informed about the education and training needs of industry but it must also promote them. The moneys allocated from the fund will dictate what programmes and courses provide this training. The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland should have a role to play in this regard. It ties in with the issue of lifelong learning and the principle of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act which was introduced by the Minister in May 1999. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment. There is some confusion in relation to the issues. We have new modern legislation in relation to certification and qualifications. I recently nominated a representative to the new authority. However, that authority's remit is to certify particular training programmes. There are many areas where the certification may go outside the remit of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. For example, I understand that in highly technical areas, such as aircraft maintenance, there are external industry-wide certification models which might continue to apply. Qualifications awarded by private bodies will not necessarily come within the remit of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As regards ongoing consultations which my Department has had with the various stakeholders in enterprise training, it is clear there is a strong desire to promote certified training and develop certification models which are appropriate to industry. Issues of scale, modularisation and cost, for example, arise here, as does the critical area of accreditation of prior learning. However, in the legislative context, we must relate this welcome goal and aspiration to the practical reality. It will be some time before the framework of qualifications is fully established and before the new structures will have dealt with the existing training and education schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under paragraph (<i>c</i>), the schemes will involve skills research, not training <i>per se</i>. I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to pro<Col N="472" /> mote the importance of certification and, within the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, to promote the focus on work-based training. However, I cannot accept the amendment which requires every facet of activity, funded or supported by the national training fund, to have NQAI approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response because I felt after the argument last night that it was feasible for the Minister to bring forward a resolution which would take account of the changes to which she has adverted and also the thrust of Deputy Naughten's amendment that some role and involvement for the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland would be desirable. We are caught now in the classic situation of a Report Stage debate that is guillotined in its totality, guillotined amendment by amendment because the rules of the House are extremely strict.</P>
      <P>While I would not go so far as to accuse the Minister of a breach of faith, it is disingenuous to find that the list of amendments does not contain a reference to one of the major focuses of the debate last night, namely, the role of the industrial training committees. We facilitated the Government in terminating this legislation before Christmas and we came into the House on Report Stage in the full knowledge that it was not in our control on the assurance from the Minister of State that he would consider the arguments advanced.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to have got a fuzzy impression of what went on last night if she thinks anyone made an argument on this side of the House for the retention of the <i>status quo</i>. We did not do that. We sought to draw to her attention and to the attention of the Minister of State that there are distinctions to be drawn between the performance, achievement and contribution of some of those committees and other committees which may have outlived their day. We discussed with the Minister of State whether the opportunity would present for us to be able to come forward with some formula which would permit of the continued existence of such committees, as an independent evaluation would suggest they were of merit and still relevant today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if amendment No. 10, for example, has been ruled out of order because I have not been given a piece of paper about the grouping of amendments or about what is ruled in or out. Perhaps that is because I was in late. We raised this specifically with the Minister of State last night. The suggestion was that the Minister would table an amendment. That amendment sought to ensure that all sections of the Bill would not be implemented together. We would invoke different sections of the Bill at different times. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of amendment No. 10 would leave it in the Minister's control to say that she would not implement X or Y until such time as she was satisfied that a transitional arrangement was in <Col N="473" /> place based on evaluation. We would then leave that to continue as appropriate.</P>
    <P>If I am not falsely anticipating, it seems the Minister has got hold of the reins today and that her officials are back in the saddle. She is saying we will not go anywhere with this. She is saying she is a bright, new, shiny Minister and she will get rid of all that social partnership nonsense. We will move on to Michael Porter and the competitive way to do things and we will not have any of the partnership stuff. It might be all right for the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to tell the social partners when he wants them to agree to something but when it comes to something practical, such as training, there will not be a role for them.</P>
    <P>The undertaking given to us in good faith last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, was that he would burn the midnight oil and come back to us with some formula which would give expression in the Bill to a willingness to retain in place some of the more valuable, pertinent, relevant and modern committees and allow the Minister make whatever changes she wanted. I am disappointed that does not seem to be provided for.</P>
    <P>I would not have agreed so readily last night to the repositioning of my amendment, which was carried by the committee, if I had known we would not get a <i>quid pro quo</i>. I would have preferred to have forced the Minister to come into the House and say she would overturn it by a decision of the House having cocked up on it last night. She is doing that now in a more diplomatic and effective way, while at the same time discounting all the arguments we made which are related to this point.</P>
    <P>Perhaps everyone at the central organisation of the trade union movement or the employers movement, that is, IBEC or the ICTU, might not be too upset about the industrial training committees. However, those at the coalface on both sides of industry are concerned. They were not aware that matters were proceeding at this pace and are just catching up with the game. They were not told at congress and, if they were, it would have intruded on the rescue job done recently on the PPF. They would have piled it into that agenda but they did not know because congress and IBEC did not tell them. They could not have known that it was the Minister's intention to fast-track the legislation through the House. Deputy Naughten and I agreed with that purely to facilitate the Bill. It seemed the sensible thing to do but we did not think the social partnership would be entirely excised from the Bill in the fashion now proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair to Members on this side of the House who tried to facilitate the Bill that three separate Ministers responded to our queries. It makes it extremely difficult to get continuity and this has been highlighted by way of the Minister's misrepresentation of what happened on Committee Stage. The Minister of <Col N="474" /> State, Deputy Kitt, failed to respond to our queries on Second Stage. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, responded to the Bill yesterday and the Minister got an inaccurate briefing for today's Report Stage. It is extremely difficult for Members who have facilitated the Minister and her Department in relation to this issue and it will make us think twice about facilitating Ministers again. Commitments were given yesterday on Committee Stage that amendments tabled by Members would be considered and addressed on Report Stage. This has been completely ignored and no reference had been made to these amendments today, which is very disappointing.</P>
      <P>On the specific wording of the amendment, it is fundamentally important that consultations take place with the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. The Minister could take a leaf out of the authority's book in relation to the structures for consultation which it has put in place. It includes representatives of people involved on the ground right on up. For some reason the Minister is afraid to put the advisory committee on a statutory basis. It is a great disappointment that this is what we are left with at the conclusion of Report Stage. The Minister is not aware of the facts and must have received a bad briefing on what took place on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>During the past few months, I have spent much time considering this issue, particularly the management and organisation that would be associated with the national training fund. The industrial training committees served a purpose in their day. They were established in the old style manufacturing sectors. The retail sector did not have such a committee, nor did several other sectors. Given the pace of change in the economy and industry, the last thing we need now is rigidity and inflexibility. Some of the best initiatives recently in the area of training have no statutory basis. The skill nets development, for example, involves approximately 60 different networks throughout the country. Some of these are based on firm size, some are based on cross sectoral training and others are based on geographic location. It would be a nightmare to try to legislate to put that aspect into effect. As someone who has been in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for approximately three and a half years &ndash; Deputy Rabbitte was there before me &ndash; the system is falling down with committees. It is rare to find an official who is not coming from or going to a committee. I am not opposed to committees if they are necessary and meaningful, but I am totally opposed to them if they exist for the sake of having them. The non-<Col N="475" /> statutory approach which allows greater flexibility and allows us to make things happen much more rapidly is the appropriate one.</P>
    <P>On the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, I am certain the advisory committee will establish close consultation with the authority. However, I do not believe it is appropriate to include this in the legislation. We would do many things differently if we were doing them all over again. FÁS has the capacity and is a very representative board. Of the 19 members on the board, two were appointed by the Minister and the remainder are appointed by various nominating bodies. They have the power, if they so desire, to set up various sub-committees, advisory committees or sectoral committees. So too has the board of Enterprise Ireland, therefore, it is not the case that we cannot already do these things. However, it is the case that we cannot write into legislation or mandate ourselves to do something that may not be necessary where there may be a better way of doing it.</P>

      <P>What we have been trying to say for the past 24 hours is that there should be some form of statutory consultation in place where required. That is of fundamental importance for the delivery of these programmes and the success of the fund. At the end of the day we are all trying to achieve the same goal. We are not saying the industrial training committees must remain but that some good elements within these committees can be built on. We are not talking about officials running here, there and everywhere to every committee under the sun. However, there should be some recognition in the legislation in relation to employers and employees regarding consultations that should take place. This was not included in the legislation until last night when the Government suffered an embarrassing defeat on Committee Stage. Otherwise there would be no reference to consultations with representatives of employees or employers.</P>
      <P>Another fundamental element of the National Qualifications Authority is that it is representative of the very bodies the Minister does not want included in the legislation. Perhaps there should be one or two members on the advisory committee because that in itself is representative of both sides and is built on the whole partnership model. Sadly, the lack of consultation structures in the Bill flies in the face of the whole ethos of partnership. The Minister would be the first person to come in here and talk about how well partnership is being used to set the country on a sound foundation. Yet, when it comes to introducing legislation, she is not prepared to copperfasten the requirement for statutory consultation.</P>

      <P>I will not revisit the matters with which we dealt on Second Stage and, at some length, on Committee Stage. Training is more important now than in the past, particularly when one considers the way our economy operates and the pace of developments we are experiencing. This Bill will improve our capacity and ability to upskill people who are already in employment. However, in framing this legislation, it was not necessary to dispense &ndash; in the manner in which it was dispensed &ndash; with the existing social partnership framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is fervently of the opinion, as she appears to be, that the industrial committees have outlived their purpose, are not appropriate, are overly rigid and do not provide for the intersectoral linkages and the other various matters we discussed last evening, it is incumbent on her to state that clearly to the social partners in <Col N="477" /> advance. She may say that she is not responsible for any breakdown in communication between the central organisations representing employees and employers, but there is no doubt that such a breakdown has occurred.</P>
    <P>The people who contributed to the work of these committees in the past are in a state of shock because they were not aware that this Bill was being fast-tracked through the House before Christmas. I do not believe the Minister has formally stated &ndash; I am sure she would make such a statement if invited to do so &ndash; that some of these committees did immensely important work.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>the construction committee. The construction industry is working at 120% of capacity at present and we ought to be trying to induce British construction companies and their workers to come to this country to help implement the national development plan. In that context, it is critical that our workforce is properly trained. The construction committee has chalked up a number of significant achievements in terms of equipping the industry for the modern age, and to dispense with it in the fashion outlined in the Bill is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister will give the House a commitment that she will ensure that these committees, which are seen to have done a good job and are still relevant in the modern context, will be put in place on a non-statutory basis. It is important that she place such an undertaking on the record before we conclude our deliberations on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Rabbitte's party, Fine Gael fully supports the ethos and thrust behind this Bill. It was for this reason we believed it was fundamentally important that the Department should meet its target to have the Bill passed during this session. The Bill is good, in principle, but, as indicated on Committee Stage, there is a need for consultation. We want a formal and statutory commitment that there will be consultation with interests involved in a particular sector in relation to the funding of that sector.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent, the Minister looks at this issue through rose-tinted glasses and she stated that the fund is separate from FÁS and Enterprise Ireland. However, progress will not be made unless these organisations obtain funding for programmes with which they intend to proceed. That is why consultation is important. I hope the Minister will give a commitment to establish a consultation process on a non-statutory basis. She should retain some of the positive elements from the old committees and use them to form part of a consultation mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of her colleagues in Government &ndash; they are probably not members of her party &ndash; have stated privately that the elements to which I refer should have been incorporated in the Bill. They are beginning to do a &ldquo;Willie O'Dea&rdquo; on her in respect of this matter, which is disappointing. I ask her to reconsider this issue to see if we can provide consultation on a non-statutory basis <Col N="478" /> because unless there is a proper consultation mechanism in place, problems could arise in respect of the implementation of the new training programmes. This Bill is of fundamental importance to the future development of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Last January my Department published a document on enterprise, training and consultation in which we covered, among other things, the industrial training committees and considered their relevance and appropriateness. It would be wrong, therefore, to state that nobody was aware of people's thinking on this subject. The Bill, which will, I hope, become an Act later in the week, was approved by the Cabinet whose members were fully aware that the training committees were not included. In that context, it would be wrong, if that is what Deputy Naughten is suggesting, to say that anybody was kept in the dark.</P>
      <P>Clearly there are many models of consultation that work and they do not all have to be placed on a statutory basis. Sometimes those that work best are those which do not operate on a statutory basis, which allows them to exercise the flexibility to which I referred earlier. At present, approximately 1.5% of company revenues is spent on training while the international spend in this regard is approximately 3%. Companies, particularly those in the indigenous sector, have, therefore, a great deal of catching up to do. If the larger Irish companies and their multinational counterparts are removed from the overall picture, the percentage spend by smaller indigenous companies is extremely small. It never ceases to amaze me how companies can identify a need to purchase the latest piece of equipment but cannot see the need to invest in training their employees.</P>
      <P>I hope the fund will play its part in focusing the attention of companies on the need for training and that it will help us pioneer many new ways of delivering training to the employed and the unemployed. That is certainly our intention. I thank the Opposition Deputies for facilitating the speedy passage of the Bill through the Dáil this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Penrose and McGrath.</P>
      <P>It has been another bad couple of days for politics, another two days of indifference on the part of the Taoiseach. Last night the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development refused to answer the charges made against him. We still have not heard the reason he failed to disclose that a farm in which he had a financial interest was licensed to feed meat-and-bone meal to pigs while the Dáil was considering banning that practice. Nothing ends a witch hunt like the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister of State O'Keeffe told the House his Department was precluded under law from making known the 17 meat-and-bone meal licences, and then promptly did so. He told the House he was writing to the Taoiseach to make known to him family interests which, he says, go beyond those required by law. However, for three years he seems to have failed to inform the Taoiseach that his family farm benefited considerably from a scheme, limited to 17 farms and administered and policed by <Col N="481" /> the very section of the Department in respect of which powers were formally delegated to him.</P>
    <P>It is fortunate for him that the Taoiseach is so blindly indifferent to these matters. A Member of this House who has, for months, obstructed a tribunal of inquiry established by this House to examine the behaviour of the former Fianna Fáil Minister and his colleagues, may not be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party but he remains a member of the Fianna Fáil club. The Taoiseach continues to draw money from the parliamentary allowance for Deputy Lawlor and Deputy Lawlor continues to avail of Fianna Fáil facilities in the new building.</P>
    <P>The ultimate irony is that the Minister of State's contribution to the debate last night started by suggesting he was not guilty of any serious offences, such as holding an offshore account. And who had Fianna Fáil nominated to sit in the Chair at that time? Deputy Denis Foley. This is GUBU of a new generation. Unlike Taoisigh of old, this one is quite prepared to stand idly by. As he does so, the reputation of us all, as well as his own, falls further into the mire.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has not even defended himself against the charges made against him. Of course we knew he was a farmer. What we did not know &ndash; and what we were entitled to know &ndash;  is that his business, in which he admits to having an interest, stood to lose £150,000, according to newspapers, from a decision of this House on a Labour Party Private Members' motion. It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The fact that the public offices commission is investigating a complaint does not and should not absolve the Taoiseach of his responsibility. Has he learned nothing from past experience? Has he even asked Deputy O'Keeffe about the issue in the last week or has he, as was the case with Deputies Burke, Ellis, Foley and Lawlor, simply waited for others to do the hard work for him?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party gets no joy from the amendment tabled this evening but it is required if this House is to have any self respect. Members of this House on the Committee of Public Accounts spent months getting to the truth about how laws made in this House were avoided and ignored. Is it any wonder our laws are not being taken seriously when we, and the Taoiseach in particular, are not prepared to enforce those now in place and which the Taoiseach proclaims in newspaper articles. Standards were expected of Members of this House before we formalised them into laws. The Taoiseach has been around long enough to know that. However, it compounds his sin, now that laws are in place, that he seems to want no hand, act or part in enforcing them. That is why the Labour Party amendment requires the support of the House this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Consumer confidence is inextricably linked with ensuring farmers regain market share as soon as possible. Tonight's discussion raises significant questions regarding BSE and <Col N="482" /> the management of the crisis for farmers, meat processors and consumers.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what my colleague, Deputy Upton, said last night when she referred to the question of the value of quality assurance schemes and their implementation and management. Such quality assurance schemes are effective only if they are underpinned by law and contained within a statutory framework. They are of no use unless penalties can be imposed, as a mandatory and not a discretionary measure, for supplying products of an inferior standard to a processor. There is no use in a processor deciding to impose sanctions when he chooses. Unless penalties are underpinned by law they are a whitewash. Quality systems will lose credibility if they are not properly managed and seen to be so. They must be monitored effectively by inspectors.</P>
      <P>Until now, carcases purchased in any country could be processed here and labelled as Irish. Who is fooling who? Is it not the consumer who is being fooled?</P>
      <P>The future well-being of 100,000 beef farmers whose livelihoods are under threat must be secured. I am especially concerned about the future of beef fatteners and beef finishers. I spoke about this matter three weeks ago but little has been done to date. I was astonished that the budget failed to put an appropriate contingency fund in place to provide the necessary compensation for farmers whose income has been decimated and who are in the throes of a crisis not of their own making. The budget was a poor day for rural Ireland, and for the farming community and its beef sector in particular. The increase of 0.1% to 4.3% of the farmers' flat rate of VAT refund from 1 January was a miserable sop to the farming community and showed extraordinary callousness and indifference to the well documented plight of beef producers and particularly beef finishers.</P>
      <P>Farmers are entitled to compensation, especially as this crisis has occurred because individual member states such as France and Germany refused to put in place appropriate BSE control measures in 1996. Surely these countries did not think BSE stopped at borders. The crisis should have been tackled at EU level as a trans-frontier issue. Were figures for BSE concealed in other countries? Was Irish beef discriminated against by these countries? I have no doubt it was. Renationalisation has taken place. We do not have a level playing field. The common market is a farce and the Irish farmer is suffering as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we suffered because of the low prices being paid to farmers over the years? Do our prices compare unfavourably with those paid to the French? We need only look at the difference between the destruction schemes in various countries. Compensation should be demanded at EU level and member states which are found to be negligent in relation to BSE measures should be forced to foot the bill. The compensation paid must reflect the actual level of loss, now running <Col N="483" /> at between £100 and £120 per animal. Livestock to the value of almost £1 billion has been eliminated in three weeks.</P>
    <P>It was a major mistake to agree to the capping of the budget at EU level, especially as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were fully aware of the difficulties in the midst of the negotiations in Nice. The farming organisations are also aghast at the import of the destruction policy agreed at the beef management committee which sees the French gaining at least 30% more per head for similar type cattle. Where does this leave the common market? Where are the farmers in all of this? We are suffering again because we are too good Europeans. The French and others who have pursued policies of renationalisation have benefited more in the negotiations than we have. Britain has spent almost £3.5 billion on dealing with the BSE problem and has recouped about 40% of that amount.</P>
    <P>We must be granted compensation at European level. We will have to spend Exchequer money. We are faced with a huge bill for finished cattle, a cow killed is halved in value and live exports are down by almost two thirds. There is still a demand for cattle under 30 months. A proper compensation scheme must be put in place. The current destruction scheme is not favourable to Irish farmers. For winter farmers in particular, the only way is to pay a top-up of £100 per head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for allowing me to contribute to this debate. I agree with Deputy Penrose's comment on the fate which besets beef farmers. Many beef farmers are facing annihilation and are not going to be able to cope with the prices they paid for cattle and the cost involved in finishing them. One farmer told me he is likely to suffer a loss of £65,000 this winter which will mean destruction. Another farmer told me he is getting out of beef farming. This individual has a substantial farm but stated he had been stung so often he was not going back into beef farming.</P>
      <P>A number of measures need to be taken. The compensation package must be agreed. Today farmers asked me where the Minister was yesterday when the figure of 83p per pound was agreed for Irish farmers, whereas their French counterparts are getting £1 per pound. Where was the Minister, what happened to him and why was he not fighting their case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the marketing of Irish beef? When the testing procedure is implemented surely we will be in a position to strongly market our beef as clean, BSE-free and so on. What about imported beef? We sometimes think that Ireland only exports beef, but the figures issued in recent years show this is not the case. For example, last year we imported 7,700 tonnes of beef, of which 55% came from the Britain which is riddled with BSE. To date this year we imported 6,500 tonnes of beef, of which 3,164 tonnes, almost 50%, came from Britain. Some of the beef imported came <Col N="484" /> from France which is the root of this problem. How can we expect farmers to abide by certain standards when imports are totally different and come from countries which may not have these controls? The French beef was not subject to these controls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important debate. It would be difficult to find a more important or pressing issue for the agriculture industry than the current problem being experienced by the beef industry. There has been a serious erosion of consumer confidence in the integrity and quality of Irish beef because of the perception that we have a BSE problem.</P>
      <P>Ireland has done more than any other country in the EU to tackle this problem and to reassure consumers of the integrity of the meat we are placing on the market. I was a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture in the late 1980s when the then Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, initiated the process under which herds in which a BSE-infected animal was found were slaughtered. Many in the industry felt the measure was excessive but time has vindicated Deputy O'Kennedy's decision. Apart from tackling the problem, the measure was very much about reassuring consumers of the integrity, quality and well-being of Irish meat.</P>
      <P>It is important that spokespersons for the various political parties realise that, in conjunction with the Minister, and irrespective of the party to which they belong, they have a responsibility to the beef industry to contribute in any way possible and, more importantly, to ensure the wording of their Private Members' motions do not undermine consumer confidence in Irish meat and beef. The veterinary regime applied in Ireland is the most rigorous and responsive in the EU but we are failing to get this message across.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt we have a minor difficulty with BSE. RTE cannot take credit for its treatment of the problem of BSE as its news coverage regularly shows footage of a staggering cow to portray the problem. This undermines the confidence of consumers in the integrity of Irish meat. It is time the producers of RTE's news programmes examined their responsibilities in this issue.</P>
      <P>Many of the theoretical farmers do not appreciate the practical difficulties faced by real farmers in rearing cattle. When one gets down to the economics of beef production one sees that, by its nature, it is a marginal activity. If Deputy Dukes did not contribute to the debate I am sure he will do so later, but he would agree that, by its nature, beef farming is a marginal business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, my primary concern is public health and the safety of food consumed by the public. Therefore, I am concerned about the public health implications of BSE and any risk it poses to humans. The protection of the public's health has to be of paramount importance and it is only when the public has been reassured that its interests are being protected that the confidence of consumers will be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> Since 1996 we have been aware of the link between BSE in cows and the new variant CJD, commonly known as VCJD, in humans. Experimental evidence indicates that VCJD and BSE are caused by the same agent. Brain tissue from VCJD patients show similar features to those of animals experimentally infected with the BSE agent. As regards the source of new variant CJD infection, the most likely explanation is the ingestion by humans of BSE-contaminated food, prior to the implementation of the ban on specified bovine offal infected with the BSE agent.</P>
    <P>With the amount of attention BSE has received in the media and in different public fora in recent months, it is important to distinguish between trade interests and initiatives needed to protect the health of consumers. The feeding of contaminated meat-and-bone-meal to ruminants precipitated this unprecedented outbreak of spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. A key step in the control of any communicable disease, is the separation of the infected agent from the susceptible host. In the case of cattle, this means an effective meat-and-bone-meal ban and for humans it is the removal of potentially infected material from the food chain. In infected animals the infected agent is found in the brain and spinal cord and several other specified risk tissues. Their exclusion from the human food chain is a key control step. Eating meat is not the risk, the risk is in eating infected meat, which is most likely to be meat containing nervous tissue. A practice used to exist in the meat industry of mechanically recovering meat from carcases after conventional butchery techniques could remove no more meat. This practice, now banned, was common in the UK but not in Ireland. This mechanically recovered meat would have contained nervous tissue and was included in the manufacture of processed meats, burgers and pies. There are currently over 80 cases of new variant CJD in the UK's population of 54 million.</P>
    <P>Irish people could have been exposed to infected material through: living in the UK during the high risk time in the mid-1980s to mid-1990s; eating contaminated products when visiting the UK; eating UK meat products, particularly those containing mechanically recovered meat imported into Ireland prior to the ban on UK meat in 1996; or eating contaminated products arising from Irish cattle.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a cattle epidemic only. Currently there is no test that can indicate if a human or an animal is incubating the disease. It is not scientifically possible to confirm that beef is BSE-free. Zero risk does not exist and the consumer must be so informed. However, the Enfer test is an additional risk reduction measure.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that BSE has been transmitted to humans via medicines or cosmetics which used bovine material in their preparation, via transplants, surgical instruments or blood transfusions, however, these routes of transmission cannot be discounted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development statistics indicate that all identified BSE cases are in animals born in 1996 or before. Given that BSE has an incubation period of between two years and ten years, that would indicate that the meat-and-bone-meal feeding ban to ruminants has been effective since 1996. The key control measure for preventing the spread of the agent to humans is the exclusion of SRMs from the human food chain. Given that we are not sure that the exclusion of SRMs is an absolute guarantee that all infection is removed and given that we know that there is not 100% compliance with the SRM controls, I welcome the opportunity the EU purchase and destruction scheme presents for the exclusion of animals born in 1996 or before from the food chain as an additional consumer protection measure.</P>
    <P>Young animals born after 1996 which have never eaten meat-and-bone-meal are as safe to eat as beef has ever been. Ireland is one of the few member states that managed to confine BSE to the older age groups. BSE is a problem for all the people of Ireland and consumers will be best served if the purchase for destruction scheme is used to maximise public health gain. I fully realise that beef farmers have serious difficulties. Nevertheless, any support strategy for farmers must be separated from the consumer protection initiatives that are needed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has undertaken consumer health initiatives in the broader context of CJD. First, to be in a position to respond rapidly and in an appropriate manner to the issue of CJD, the Minister for Health and Children established a CJD advisory group in September 1996. Second, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland established a scientific sub-committee specially to examine BSE. This sub-committee is chaired by Professor Michael Gibney who is chair of one of the EU advisory committees on BSE. Third, a CJD surveillance system has been set up. Surveillance of CJD is a priority in order to establish the true incidence of the disease and to determine any changes in the pattern or nature of its occurrence. Fourth, a CJD research programme was established. In Europe, the importance of research into CJD-BSE was recognised at an early stage and the EU established a specific research programme. This dealt with the diagnosis, epidemiological surveillance, prevention and control of BSE-CJD.</P>
    <P>CJD is a notifiable disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate for the purpose of supporting the efforts being made by the Minister and the House to achieve two objectives, vindicating the quality of the Irish beef product and reassuring the consumer, at home and abroad, of the quality of that product. I was Minister for Agriculture when the outbreak of BSE occurred in England and Northern Ireland. I remember in 1989 when we did not have a single case of a BSE infected animal. Every day I sought reports from our chief veterinary officer as to whether an incident of a BSE infected animal had occurred here. I remember the day well in early 1989 when I was informed that because of the outbreak of the disease in England and the proximity of this country to Northern Ireland, where there was also an outbreak of the disease, a case of a BSE infected animal was announced and confirmed in Cavan. I immediately went to the Government, knowing the significance of that incident for our industry and our consumers. I asked the Government to give me leave to do two things, which it did, one of which I could have done in my own right, to ban the use of meat-and-bone-meal feed to ruminants and, second, to guarantee that we could have an immediate <Col N="489" /> slaughter policy of all herds where any single incident occurred. I recall the Taoiseach of the day asking me how much would this cost. My response was, &ldquo;I don't have a clue, but I can tell you it will cost us a lot more if we don't do it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Consequent on that, we vindicated from the start the quality of our product and our concern for consumers. I then went to Europe at that time because there was an outbreak of the disease in Britain, but unfortunately our European partners would not introduce a European regime to tackle the problem because they claimed they had no problem. Britain had an outbreak of the disease and we had isolated incidents. We had a grass based industry compared to most of our European partners, be they Dutch, German, Belgian or French, who had highly concentrated feed lots, which would not have been grass based. I could not understand then why they did not have the problem we have.</P>
      <P>It is time we reminded our European partners of the actions we took from the beginning and of their reluctance to follow us along those lines. It is important that European consumers should know that Ireland was up front from the beginning, that the quality of our product was vindicated from the beginning and that we did not hide or attempt to hide from consumers or others the actions we were taking. Our European counterparts failed to take similar actions and we are all suffering as a result.</P>
      <P>I want to make two further comments. We acted at that time on the level of scientific knowledge available, but as the Minister of State acknowledged, much more scientific knowledge is available now in terms of the link between BSE and CJD. That was not available then. Despite the fact that our only concern then was protection of both the producer and consumer interest, we paid top dollar for all animals that were slaughtered. Unfortunately, a small number of rogue farmers abused that to an extent. It has been proved to have happened since and is always a problem. They introduced BSE into their herds to avail of the premium payments we were making available. That is a disgrace to any industry and anyone found doing so should be penalised and punished.</P>
      <P>We had another problem at the same time when the term &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; was used widely about other rogue farmers. When I was Minister for Agriculture I refused to use that term and called it devil dust, which is what it was. There were some unrepresentative, individual farmers who did their damnedest to undermine the quality of our great industry for their own selfish reasons. The Minister is working hard to vindicate it now and I hope the fact we took action before anyone else is seen by European consumers as a vindication of that industry.</P>

      <P>The emergence of BSE in the livestock of countries hitherto believed to be BSE-free is a huge challenge to food producers and consumers in Ireland and throughout <Col N="490" /> Europe. It places a great responsibility on Governments which are charged with safeguarding the health of their citizens. Once again the confidence of the public in the ability of the agricultural sector to produce safe and high quality beef has been shaken and one of our key industries faces massive difficulties. The great potential for further development of Irish beef production and processing and the promotion of the Irish product in a world market is under threat and clearly a determined and comprehensive approach is required of the Government.</P>
      <P>I concur therefore with most of the proposals contained in the Private Members' motion signed by Fine Gael Members. These measures are necessary to ensure that Irish beef is safe and is seen to be safe. The testing of all beef animals entering the food chain will be a major and costly undertaking but it must be done. Those farmers who are affected must be assisted appropriately and the Government must push for consistent and effective anti-BSE measures throughout the EU, a number of whose member states have been far more lax than this State in their approach to the problem.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the proposal in this motion for the construction of an incineration plant. This could prove to be the Trojan cow for the entire network of incinerators which the Government and other interests wish to impose on communities throughout the State. I share the strong view of many people that such an approach to waste management is unacceptable both on human health and environmental grounds.</P>

      <P>Any motion relating to BSE at present is important but the matter of CJD and its effect on human health and, therefore, on consumer confidence is even more important. The debate in Ireland tends to concentrate on the problems BSE creates for producers rather than on its consequences for human health. I have been concerned for some time that public health is not high on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development's list of priorities. As a result, consumer confidence at home and abroad has been greatly lessened, as has been indicated by the present market difficulties. If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development were to reorder his priorities and put trade concerns after human health and consumer confidence, the market problems would soon disappear. Consumer confidence leads trade, not the other way around.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago I drew the attention of the Minister privately, by letter, to the fact that a meat plant in Patrickswell, County Limerick, which was the sole location for the slaughter of BSE-depopulated herds in the country, was also being used to slaughter cattle for human consumption in the Limerick region. I drew his attention to the potential dangers of this to human health and the extreme undesirability of this practice, which was fully authorised by his Department. After a lapse of some time I finally got a reply from which I learned the Department proposed to change the practice and to confine this plant to killing BSE-depopulated herds only. This, of course, was only done by the Department when they learned I knew what was going on. If I had not found out no change would have been made.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority was not aware of what was happening in Patrickswell and I understand they expressed their concern about it, quite understandably. After I informed the Food Safety Authority I understand it contacted the Minister for Health and Children who insisted with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development that this arrangement would have to cease because of its implications for public health. This had been going on for several years and if I had not drawn attention to it it might well have gone on for several more years, with potentially serious consequences. Is it any wonder that consumers are worried and have no confidence in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The real danger to public health is likely to arise only from elderly animals and in particular those fed on meat-and-bone-meal prior to proper controls coming in here for the first time in 1996-1997. The European scheme endorsed here, of unnecessary wholesale destruction, is really a market support scheme and not a public health measure. A new proposal to offer a test or destruction to all animals over 30 months is unnecessary and immoral in a world where one billion people or more do not have enough to eat. As only a tiny proportion of depopulated herds are shown to contain a BSE case, the unnecessary destruction that has been going on for some years is no more than a public relations exercise and is indefensible. Whatever destruction is necessary could be done on a more limited scale. The culling of elderly animals, usually spent cows, is all that is essential.</P>
    <P>The real crime is the use of meat-and-bone-meal here which was tolerated for so long and is still tolerated in the pig industry. I believe on good authority that the reason that 17 licences were granted to large pig producers for the use of meat-and-bone-meal was simply to comply with World Trade Organisation rules which would have prevented us exporting meat-and-bone-meal unless we were also selling it on our home market. That meat-and-bone-meal was exported to Britain and re-exported on from there to other countries, most of them non-European. I warn now that the long-term consequences of that could be very serious indeed.</P>

      <P>The Government's failure to deliver any EU aid for the embattled livestock sector begs major questions of the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development regarding their ability to lobby and get support from the EU for Ireland's most important industry in this serious crisis. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development attended the Agriculture Council meetings and, in fairness, I understood he went to Egypt but to date, no results. The Taoiseach spent days in Nice, France, at the European Council meetings but failed to get the extra funds needed at EU level to compensate farming families for an EU based problem. It was clearly in our minds that Germany, France and others opted out of that serious situation over past years. They failed to get full information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final straw is the fact that the EU Beef Management Committee meeting in Brussels on Tuesday will have disastrous results for Ireland and discriminate heavily against Irish livestock farmers. The Government's failure to reopen the live export markets to Egypt and Libya left Irish livestock farmers vulnerable at times like this. In <Col N="494" /> the first 11 months of 1995, 263,000 live cattle were exported to non-EU countries where, as in the first 11 months of the year 2000, only 63,000 found their way to non-EU countries. These are not facts of mine, they are facts of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>Where is the Government's commitment to the people, that if they were returned to power after the last election there would be no problem reopening these markets and the beef market to Iran? I accept that there has been a major increase in live exports of high quality young cattle to continental Europe and this has been important to the suckler cow farmer but it has caused serious problems for the committed livestock farmers who have to compete for store cattle and now find themselves facing bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year, there will be up to 2,000 fewer cattle disposed of, either live or dead, compared to 1999. There is no doubt we are heading towards a build-up. Cow kill is now down to less than 50% of normal over the past few weeks. Cattle prices have fallen, with steers down around £90 to £100 per head, heifers over £60 per head with cows down anywhere from £150 to £200, depending on quality. The fact that the Government ignored agriculture in the budget and only mentioned BSE in a passing fashion means that we first must get the Government and the Minister for Finance to realise that we have a problem, admit the extent of the crisis and immediately provide national finance, if not EU finance, to prevent thousands of livestock farmers from going out of business.</P>
    <P>The Government must act decisively and quickly on this BSE crisis. They must restore confidence in the industry by taking every step necessary to guarantee consumers a quality product. The Taoiseach must ensure his Ministers lead by example. It is very important the Minister leads by example and that all his colleagues do the same.</P>
    <P>The then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, when the BSE crisis hit first, had to ring the Egyptian Prime Minister to get the cattle taken off the boats that were then at sea. At that stage, there was a major debate in this House. It was interesting to hear the comments of Deputy Kirk tonight, condemning Deputy Dukes for raising the debate. I clearly remember in the House at that time, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen and the Taoiseach telling us all how easily situations like this were dealt with. They had all the answers. They just boarded planes, went out and solved those problems overnight.</P>
    <P>This Minister is a very nice man. He obviously has the farm organisations, or some of them, closely involved with him. As I learned the other day, they are more likely to be in his pocket than worry about the crisis out there. I urge the Minister and farming organisations as well to do what is necessary to make sure a quality product is pro<Col N="495" /> vided for the consumers and that thousands of farmers are not put out of business as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not contributed in this House for a long period on a debate as serious at this for the people I know best, that is, the farming community. What happened in 1996 with the BSE problem could be a garden party compared to what could happen if this crisis is not handled properly. I do not want to be a bearer of bad news. Over the past few years, I have gone out of my way to be restrained regarding anything concerning BSE because although there were many actions that should have been taken, some of the hysterical things I heard about it were out of all proportion. However, this time the chickens have come home to roost, unfortunately, and it is not of our making.</P>
      <P>In case anyone is in any doubt, there will be many losers in this but the foremost losers are the men and women of the farming community with stocks in their slatted houses today, who do not know from one day to the next whether they will be able to take the cattle out in the ordinary way and sell them either at a mart or a factory. It is that bad and anybody in the House that does not understand that is fooling themselves. One does not have to be a genius to know the effect that will have on 160,000 Irish farming families. It is important to put on record that when one see what happened in France and Germany &ndash; and I am very ashamed of what the Germans and the French did because they were in a state of denial since even 1996 &ndash; if ever I saw a case for the renationalisation of markets within the European Community, I see it now. There is no doubt there is BSE in those countries and unless this is solved as an overall problem, we will be submerged in the middle of it.</P>
      <P>I agree with most of what has been said in the House tonight. There is a consensus here. We did what we could as a nation to ensure that we had the best possible product for our customers at home and worldwide. Our problem was that not everybody else did the same thing and because we export nine out of every ten animals in Irish fields, one can take it that in a domestic market like France or Germany, they are always importing. They will buy first from their own farmers even though we signed up to a Common Agricultural Policy where our produce had the same right to be on their market as their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that I do not have enough time. However, one sees the corrosive effect every day as markets are closed to us, Saudi Arabia one day or Egypt the next, that means the other states that might have lived with us are being forced to lose their borders. What kind of parliament would we have if the computer industry closed down? If the chemical industry closed down and there were no exports from Dublin Port there would be many more worried people than there are with regard to what is happening now. Despite all the raiméis about what we will have <Col N="496" /> to do, this will cost money. If we are to keep the farming community together as a viable unit, it must not be asked to take less than other European farmers. I am talking about 90p intervention. I do not know whether there will be a cull or if a test will be introduced. Whatever measure is introduced, I hope our partners are subjected to the same, otherwise we will be seen in a poor light.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that the Minister of State with responsibility for food should have tied himself in a knot, particularly when we have such problems. I do not wish to personalise the matter, but such a Minister, with the image he has all over the world, is not good for us in our present predicament.</P>

      <P>A fortnight ago Deputy Upton tabled a Private Members' motion on which we had a reasoned and organised debate because we did not want to affect our beef industry. Much has changed in that time.</P>
      <P>I was appalled listening to Deputy O'Malley who made very serious allegations against the Department of Agriculture and Food. I was not aware of that until he spoke in the House tonight. The Minister must respond to these allegations immediately. If they are true, and the Minister and the Department were aware of it, three new Ministers must be appointed.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time we had a problem in the beef industry. We did not learn from it the last time. Recently in the south we saw where farmers pumped slurry into cattle. Others infected their herds in order to get compensation from the Department. Do they realise what they are doing to this product, to the State and to farmers who depend on this industry? If a poor person stole £10 from Dunnes Stores in Dublin they would be given a six months' sentence but <Col N="497" /> the judge in that case gave a suspended sentence. That sent out the wrong message. A strong message should have been given by the judge that anyone who tried to sabotage this national industry would be put behind bars.</P>

      <P>I was not a Member of the House for long when Deputy Yates was Minister. Then we had the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and his two men from the south, the rebels beside him, and Deputy Cowen who was frothing at the mouth. He was doing so well he could have taken flight. He told Deputy Yates what to do. Deputy Yates went to Europe and agreed a package of £50 per head. What has the Minister negotiated?</P>
      <P>I read the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> last week. I am not a farmer, but I like the paper and buy it every week as it keeps me informed. The Minister informs the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> about what is happening more so than the House. If the message he wants to send is that he has disrespect for this House, that is fine.</P>
      <P>There is no future in farming for many farmers. Deputy Connaughton is right, there are many farmers in my constituency and throughout the country who will not have a good Christmas. Their product will remain in sheds and they do not know what will happen to it. We have three Ministers from the south, one disaster after the other, doing nothing about it. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, and Ministers of State, Deputies Davern and O'Keeffe are three nice guys but nice guys do not get on in the world. What we want is three strong men in Europe and it is time we had them. The Taoiseach is not strong enough to do the job. We need a new Government, Taoiseach and three Ministers.</P>

      <P>I regret that I have little or no confidence in the capacity of the Minister and his colleagues or the Department to deal with the crisis in agriculture, particularly in beef production, and the health risks posed by the outbreaks of BSE. As Deputy O'Malley said, we can prioritise the issues according to how strongly we feel about them, be they health risks, markets, producers and so on.</P>
      <P>I do not understand how, when the Council of Ministers established a community approach to dealing with BSE, the Minister capitulated and agreed that if there is a purchase for destruction scheme we must accept a price of £170 less per animal than our counterparts in France. That is the fault of the Minister. He has failed the farmers once more, the producers, who are now in crisis. Many family farms depending on an income from farming have been let down by the Minister, but that is nothing new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was made aware of a serious matter in County Galway relating to an outbreak of BSE. In his reply to me today, I was astounded <Col N="498" /> at how out of touch the Minister is with reality. This animal was dying from BSE and was buried, under the supervision of the Department, beside the source of water for four families. When it was discovered, the Department was informed but failed the remove the animal for a week. In reply to a question I tabled on the matter, the Minister informed me that, in the case referred to, the trailer that was used to transport the animal was abandoned in a most dangerous manner without regard for human or animal health. Now it is in a secure place which the Minister is not allowed to disclose. A more permanent solution for the disposal of the carcase is to be decided upon. Is the Minister stating that months after this animal was identified, buried and exhumed it is now in a secure place which he will not disclose? That is a disgrace. It is a danger to human health. The Minister said he cannot release the trailer used to transport the animal. He cannot have it both ways. The Minister has failed on all counts. That is why I do not have any confidence in his capacity to deal with the crisis in agriculture, particularly in relation to BSE. The Minister, along with his junior Minister, has to reassess his situation. The most reasonable thing he could do is to hand this over to somebody who will tackle it in a more serious way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week when this motion was tabled someone asked me why we tabled a motion on BSE. It is important because it is not just an issue facing the farming community. Last Sunday the international media ran with an article which published a report that the first known indigenous case of variant form Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was diagnosed outside Europe. This report, which came on top of the closure of Irish beef markets in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines in conjunction with the drop off in beef consumption in the European Union, has now set in train a serious catastrophe in the agriculture industry and the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>This is a disaster not just for farmers or for meat factory employees but for the consumer, food production, manufacture and export. There are approximately 12,400 staff working within the Irish meat industry. Their jobs are now threatened by this new BSE crisis. Some 39,300 jobs are directly reliant on the reputation of Irish food and its reputation abroad. How many billions of pounds will the BSE outbreak cost us when every animal has to be tested at a cost of £25 per head, when every at risk animal has to be destroyed, when all these carcases have to be incinerated or otherwise disposed of, when the costs have to be met and when compensation has to be provided to farm families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, with a herd of 7.5 million cattle, could be faced with a bill of up to £2.8 billion. That is why this situation is serious for everybody and <Col N="499" /> not only the farm bodies. We must ensure immediate measures are taken so that Irish and foreign consumers continue to have the confidence to consume safe Irish beef, that farm families can make a living from its production, that our processing plants can continue to employ Irish staff and that we can secure the reputation of all Irish food products abroad.</P>
    <P>Our ability to deal with these issues is seriously compromised by the Government's ineptitude in dealing with the grave issues that confront us. It is not a responsible Government like the previous one whose Minister, Deputy Yates, tackled this issue head on. He did not play to the gallery; he was prepared to take the tough decisions needed. We have to be conscious that we are dealing with one of the most important public health issues and consumer perceptions are not conscious of the minuscule risk of infection.</P>
    <P>We need to be in a position where we can certify tested BSE free beef at home and in the markets abroad as quickly as possible. We must be able to track beef from the farm to the fork &ndash; from the farm to the processor to the retailer to the kitchen table. We require an effective and transparent system which will give us the opportunity to restore public confidence in beef production which is a vital element of our food production. We must provide immediate testing for animals entering the food chain and we must be able to identify, track and ensure we eliminate BSE. This testing must begin now. Such a test has been in place for a number of years in some supermarkets, namely the ENFER test. In all the tests which have taken place, no animal has been found with BSE.</P>
    <P>Ireland has implemented the most stringent regulations in Europe. We need our European partners to buy into the same stringent regulations. We need to lead this debate and to lead in the introduction of these new measures. As this country has a greater reliance on the beef industry than any other country in the European Union, we need to ensure all our European colleagues implement a fair system that ensures we can guarantee the viability of our farms and of beef production and guarantee our beef is BSE free, safe to eat and a prime quality product. I urge the Minister to reconsider his decision to amend this motion. This is of fundamental importance to the Irish beef sector and I urge him not only on behalf of the beef sector but on behalf of the consumer to accept the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion put forward by my colleague, Deputy Dukes. It is remarkable, but unfortunate, that this is the second time in almost a fortnight a motion has been tabled to deal with the BSE crisis. I concur fully with what my colleague, Deputy Naughten, said. This issue is not simply about the farming side because BSE is a huge problem from the consumer point of view and we must tackle it <Col N="500" /> both from a consumer and a producer point of view.</P>
      <P>Nobody can doubt the value and importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy. That is something to which my party leader, Deputy Bruton, referred during his speech on the budget today. At a time when there is a major economic emphasis on the computer and pharmaceutical industries, we have to be very careful to prepare for the day when agriculture is again our core industry. It would be a great shame and an economic disaster if we cannot protect and provide for the beef industry.</P>
      <P>It was disappointing that the Minister for Finance, during his very lengthy budget speech, almost totally ignored the agriculture sector and did not give any indication of a provision for compensation for BSE. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development knows that unless adequate compensation is put in place, tens of thousands of beef farms will disappear. That will be bad for rural Ireland, for the economy and for the social fabric of this country. Sadly, what we have seen and heard from Brussels and from the Minister's efforts in recent days gives us no cause for optimism. We need to see the colour of the Government's money on this issue. We need an early statement from the Minister on what compensatory measures will be put in place.</P>
      <P>There is a fear among the agricultural community about where the beef industry is going. Over the past fortnight or so, the confidence which was slowly and effectively built up in the beef industry over the past three or four years has disappeared. Sadly, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. The Minister's job is to lead, to show the farmers there is a future in the beef industry, to ensure a package is put in place to give compensation where it is so urgently required and to put in place an intervention system that will give a reasonable return. Unfortunately, we have not had any indication to date from the Minister that he is meeting this challenge.</P>
      <P>The motion put forward by the Fine Gael Party is cautious in its wording and takes into account a very serious national debate that needs to take place on this issue. It is not scaremongering; it is simply responding to what is a genuinely serious situation for rural Ireland, the consumer and the producer. The Minister's response last night and that of his junior Minister gives no cause for optimism or confidence. I hope the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will be able to add something further to what was said last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the point scoring that occurs in every Dáil debate fades away, we will still have to ensure there is a beef industry and that the Minister and his Government colleagues can lead in the defence of that beef industry over the next few days and weeks. I would like to hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, what, unfortunately, we did not hear from the Minister last night. The Fine Gael motion is worthy of support. It is a bit like the motion put forward by <Col N="501" /> Deputy Upton and her colleagues in the Labour Party a fortnight ago. Because of the political games played on the Government side the motion was cast aside. That is not how we should deal with the issue. When a serious motion, properly constructed in a fair and balanced fashion, is brought before the House it should not be dismissed. I regret the Minister is attempting to sideline the Fine Gael motion for his own political purposes. There is no word in the motion which is offside as far as a constructive debate on this industry is concerned.</P>

      <P>This is the fourth occasion in two weeks when Members have had the opportunity to discuss matters relating to BSE, food safety and related issues, including the impact on markets. This intense focus by the Oireachtas on the most recent developments relating to BSE reflects the national importance of the issue. It should convey a clear message at home and abroad that Members of this House and of the Seanad take a great interest in food safety, consumer protection and matters affecting our agri-food sector. Let us put it in perspective. We have 567 cases of BSE out of a herd of 7.5 million animals which is 0.0012%. England has 177,000 cases out of a herd of over 11 million animals. For God's sake let us not decry our farming community in this fashion. Let us have confidence in our own community.

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Dukes. This matter is all about compensation. We can talk forever here and argue major points but at the end of the day if we are to save the farming population it is about compensation. The money is available. I hope the Government has the willpower to provide a decent package for farmers on top of what he has already achieved. I understand the compensation proposed is the average price of beef during the past four weeks for each country. A case is being made that it should be the average price during the past four weeks in the whole Community. That is where the negotiations failed. The price of beef in France and in other countries is much higher than here. If the average price applies in each country it means Irish farmers will receive less compensation than their European counterparts. We have been caught again. The only way this can be made up is through a national package in addition to the European package. If the Minister is concerned and if there is a commitment from the Government towards the farming population, which is still the backbone of rural communities, then he must act. I do not want to cast any slurs in this House on the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, whom I know well and is a nice man outside the House. In here though he has stooped to low depths over the years and he has done so in relation to myself. I do not wish to say anything to him. It is up to him and his conscience and his Leader to decide what he should do. As regards farmers it is a matter of compensation and it is within the Minister's power to act. He will have to make it available if they are to be saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Minister for Finance to think again about the position he will take on this motion, if he means what he says then he actually agrees with our motion. Two paragraphs in the Minister's amendment are directly taken from the Fine Gael motion. They are two important ones:</P>
      <P>conscious of the new and greater difficulties for Irish farmers resulting from the detection of BSE in Continental EU member states;</P>
      <P>wishing to counter the serious consequences which this could have for farm families, workers in the food processing industry and the fabric of rural society and communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's motion has taken those two paragraphs word for word from the motion I tabled in the names of all the Fine Gael Deputies. If the Minister really means that he should accept the motion before the House. The Minister talked about safeguarding the integrity and the safety of Irish beef. That is perfectly in keeping with the motion. In all the places in the amendment where the Minister speaks about what he will actually do in relation to the difficulties this creates for Irish farmers and for rural communities, the Minister's amendment is weaker than the Fine Gael motion. He does not say we want a compensation scheme. He does not say we want equality of treatment with farmers in other member states. <Col N="504" /> The Minister would do well to listen to what Deputy Deenihan said. The Minister's amendment is weaker than our motion on every one of those important aspects. The Minister even has a paragraph in his amendment similar to ours about the energetic and innovative approach to the promotion of Irish beef and cattle. Even that, unfortunately, is less specific than the terms of the motion before the House.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister, if he really means what he said here last night and in the Government's amendment to the motion, to withdraw the amendment and agree with the Fine Gael motion. Let us proceed on this crucial issue on the basis of agreement. Let us proceed to protect the health of consumers on the basis of agreement in this House. Let us proceed to deal with the consequences of this for farming families, rural communities, our food processing industry and the people who work in that industry on the basis of some agreement in this House.</P>
    <P>Let us make no mistake about this. I do not want to dramatise it, but we must face the reality. The crisis we are facing now has the potential to bring about the greatest change in dietary habits across Europe in a generation. That is what we are facing. We must deal with that with credibility and assurance.</P>
    <P>Irish farmers and the Irish food processing industry will suffer because other member states of the European Union did not take the action in 1996 that we took. We are about to be caught up in the consequences of that. The Irish rural community and food processing industry will be affected as a result of the laxity and carelessness of other member states four years ago when we took appropriate measures.</P>
    <P>It is up to our Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to ensure that damage is limited as much as possible and that we put in place measures that will restore the name, reputation and image of safety and quality of Irish beef. I again ask the Minister, if he means what he said here last night and in the amendment he tabled, to support the motion and not make a political football out of it, rather than coming here with a rag of an amendment, which is what Departments always do at the bidding of Ministers who simply do not want to agree that the Opposition has taken the lead on a matter. The Minister should forget that because this is too important.</P>
    <P>There is a very important point here, to which Deputy Deenihan and others referred last night and tonight. We want to ensure there is equality of treatment of farmers throughout the European Union on how this problem is dealt with. We want to ensure Irish farmers do not unfairly have to bear a higher cost than they should because of the negligence of governments of other member states.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I am appalled by something in the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, which he did not have time to say but which I have read in his script. In it, he refers to the <Col N="505" /> difference in prices that will be available to Irish producers, compared to those that will be available to farmers in France. I will quote what he was going to say because, I regret to say, these seem to be the facts of the situation that faces us. The speech states:</P>
    <P>The French price under the scheme will be higher than the price in Ireland, only to the extent that it is normally higher than Irish prices. Secondly, it is of major importance to Irish producers that the scheme actually succeeds in removing the surplus. This will happen only if the destruction price is attractive to producers in all member states, which means that it needs to be set at a reasonable level, relative to the market.</P>
    <P>That means the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and at least one of his Ministers of State have already thrown in the towel. They are accepting that once again, as has happened time after time, in scheme after scheme, Irish farmers will be less well treated than farmers in other member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>It might be said that the destruction price has to be attractive to producers in all member states, which it has. It also has to be attractive to farmers here. There is no reason any Irish Minister should accept, as a matter of form or practice and without arguing about it, that the price available to Irish producers should be less favourable than that available to producers anywhere else. I call on the Minister to ensure that scheme when it is put into operation gives Irish farmers the same treatment that farmers will get in other member states of the European Union. It is just as important that every aspect of this scheme works as well in Ireland as it does anywhere else.</P>
    <P>There is one major point of difference between the Government and the Opposition on this motion, which is the situation of the Minister of State in charge of food quality and safety. Last night the Minister of State delivered a most incoherent rant to the House, a 20 minute speech which he tried to deliver in ten minutes. It avoided all the main issues and was littered with inconsistencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, was interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning about the situation of his Minister of State. I do not want to dramatise this, but everyone who heard that interview will know what I mean. His replies about the situation of the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, were terse. He gave every appearance of being somebody who knew he was on the radio to defend the indefensible. I must confess I felt a bit sorry for him because I knew he wanted to say that the Minister of State should go, especially after his performance here last night.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke last night of the fact that he is now writing to the Taoiseach to draw his attention, under the terms of the Ethics <Col N="506" /> in Public Office Act and Cabinet procedure handbooks, to the connections of his family with various businesses, thereby admitting that he has not done so up to now and that he should have done so before now. On that ground alone, he deserves to resign. That is an admission of a serious impropriety on his part. The fact that these matters have been referred by myself and Deputy Howlin to the Public Offices Commission does not, in any way, absolve the Taoiseach of his political responsibility for office holders appointed by him. The Taoiseach should act now without waiting for the Public Offices Commission to act.</P>
    <P>Second, the Minister of State admitted that he was a member until yesterday of a committee of Dairygold, membership of which requires that one is a full-time farmer. He was fooling either Dairygold or this House until yesterday evening, when he said he was resigning from that committee.</P>
    <P>Third, the Minister of State referred last night early in his speech, after where a paragraph had obviously been deleted by the spin doctors, to this &ldquo;minimal activity&rdquo; in relation to his farm. He has not explained what that minimal activity was. I submit that, on the basis of what the Minister of State said here last night and other information that has become available, he has been actively involved since he took office in running the affairs of his family's farming enterprises in contravention of the terms of the Ethics in Public Office Act and the procedures set out in the Cabinet handbook. Having admitted to doing so, he should now resign.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the Minister of State admitted last night that his family's farm, which he is clearly involved in managing, decided explicitly not to follow best practice in pig production. They decided explicitly not to do what over 90% of pig producers in the country have done. He is the Minister of State who is supposed to promote food quality and good standards in food production in our country.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also admitted last night that there was an involvement by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in the question of licensing. He tried to pretend that the issuing of licences under statute is a matter for civil servants. We know it comes within the political responsibility of the political heads of the Department, that is, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his Ministers of State. A Minister of State who does not accept that position has no business staying in his job. He should go now.</P>
    <P>I again invite the Minister to withdraw the idiotic Government amendment, support the motion and let us go forward on that basis. I also call on him to tell his Minister of State, who has sullied the name of Irish quality food, to resign before it is too late.</P>

    <Title>Insurance Bill, 1999: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, perhaps it would be helpful if the Minister of State gave the House a brief clarification of the amendments. I was only able today to obtain a copy of the Bill as passed by the House. The Minister of State was most helpful in this regard but perhaps he could outline the amendments as we go through them to simplify the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to each amendment at the request of Deputy Naughten or any other Member. This might help to provide the necessary information so we can reach agreement.</P>
      <P>Section 7: Seanad amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 33 to 36 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>v</i>)particulars of any rating factor applicable and of any additional amount payable by reason of it;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In response to comments made on Committee Stage in the Seanad, I brought forward an amendment to avoid any suggestion that the mention of specific rating factors gave them official sanction. Accordingly, the Seanad adopted this amendment which achieves the objective of providing the consumer with relevant information without conferring any particular legitimacy on one rating factor over another. Consequently, with the agreement of the Seanad, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. This is an important amendment and I will give two examples of how the change strengthens the Bill. The first concerns genetic testing which has become an issue. A recent decision by the British Parliament approved a genetic test for insurance purposes regarding the diagnosis of Huntington's disease.</P>
      <P>There are pros and cons to this decision. It protects those who may be members of families prone to the disease as they would obtain insurance if they took the test. That may not happen if the suspicion exists that such people have Huntington's disease due to their parentage.</P>
      <P>This is a fundamental issue and the British Parliament's decision to allow this practice could open the flood gates to genetic testing over the long term. In principle, this would discriminate against anyone with any form of genetic error, however mild, or who has a possibility of developing an illness in the long term. For example, in a few years someone could be genetically tested resulting in a diagnosis that he or she would only live to the age of 55. Such a person may not be able to obtain life assurance and that would be wrong. This is a fine line and I hope the Minister of State will note this issue to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected. This amendment can help to facilitate this objective, even though it will not make a decision one way or the other.</P>
      <P>The second issue is car insurance for young people, which is close to the Minister of State's heart and one in which I have a personal interest. I am fully aware of this issue as I am paying through the nose for insurance. People are discriminated against on the grounds of age and not inexperience. The fundamental principle behind car insurance is that people are treated in accordance with the risk they pose. However, insurance companies do not consider people on the basis of the risk they pose but on the basis of their age.</P>
      <P>The age group 17 to 24 includes the youngest people who will seek car insurance. If a 17 year old seeks insurance he or she will be quoted the same figure as a 23 year old. This takes no account of the fact that the 23 year old may have been driving for four years, have built up experience and have a clean record. However, such people are discriminated against because they are within this age bracket and because the insurance companies' decisions are taken solely on the basis of age. I am glad this amendment takes account of this situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State might comment on the two points I have raised which are fundamental issues. I know he is examining the issue of car insurance and he might like to outline when he hopes to receive a report from the advisory board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am concerned about genetic testing which I raised on the Adjournment some weeks ago. Following the British decision to allow genetic testing, there is concern that this could mean insurance companies could ask people to take a genetic test. Even if they do not ask people to take such a test, there is concern they could ask if one has taken a test in the past. This opens up a minefield in that if one has taken the test does one want to make the information available? Many people would feel this infringes their right to privacy. I agree that one's genetic make-up is a private issue and that it should not be available for insurance purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> A number of Deputies raised this issue and the answer has been that it does not affect people in Ireland. However, I am concerned that a number of insurance companies operating in Ireland have a base in the UK and, therefore, we should be concerned the practice could spill over into this country.</P>
    <P>A number of geneticists working in this country, particularly in Trinity College, have published their concerns on how this issue will develop in the letters page of <i>The Irish Times</i>. They feel now is the time to introduce legislation to restrict such practices. I have discussed the matter with them a read a number of reports on the subject, and I too am concerned.</P>
    <P>Genetic testing is a private issue. It is not allowed in the US and, to the best of my knowledge, the UK is the first European country to allow it. Now is the time to act to ensure such information is not made public and is not available to insurance companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the Deputies' contributions that they are aware that the Irish Insurance Federation is finalising a code of conduct for its members. I expect the code will be observed by any insurer active in the Irish market. The code, as drafted, would forbid insurers to require clients to undergo genetic testing. It would also prevent them from offering rates lower than the norm to clients who are willing to undergo genetic testing. This is an important safeguard and prevents the introduction of genetic testing by the backdoor. Thanks to this code we have time to consider all of the issues in relation to insurance and genetic testing and come to a well researched position.</P>
      <P>The officials of the insurance division of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have begun a process of consultation initially with public bodies so that we may consider all of the relevant matters, including contributions from the scientific and health communities. I am conscious of the importance for public health of voluntary genetic testing in certain circumstances. I note the point that in the majority of cases environmental factors are of more significance than genetic inheritance for the purposes of longevity. Some European Union countries have legislated on this matter and I would be interested to learn what they have done and what effect their legislation has had to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment, rating risk according to sex, place of residence and other criteria is familiar in non-life insurance. It is deployed most frequently, as Deputy Naughten said, in motor insurance. Women, by and large, are less expensive in terms of claim settlements. Drivers based in rural areas are exposed to less risk than those driving in Dublin or certain other parts of the country. The size of car, engine size and age are also other rating factors. That is an accepted norm in the insurance industry in terms of insurance cover. There is nothing wrong with <Col N="516" /> using such factors. However, rating risk on grounds of age or sex will have to be backed up by actuarial data to comply with the Equal Status Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten referred to the price of motor insurance. I and my officials have devoted a great deal of time to this matter during the past three years. I established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1998, which is representative of every organisation, Department, State agency and interest in the motor insurance area. I expect it will conclude its work some time next year, perhaps towards the end of the year, but I am not sure, although the indications are it will need another year to conclude its report.</P>
    <P>A total of 50% of all accidents involve 17 years olds to 35 years olds. Insurance companies impose a loading on motorists in certain age categories, motorists aged 17 to 19, 19 to 21, 21 to 23, 23 to 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 35 and motorists over that age are treated fairly equal, depending on other criteria.</P>
    <P>We have a serious litigation situation as people are very litigation conscious. There are many insurance claims and many claims paid out are in excess of £1 million. It takes 1,500 premia to equate to £1 million of a liability payment, which is a vast amount of money. The litigation situation is creating a major difficulty in the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>The insurance report for 1999, which I hope to publish during the next fortnight, will show that all the companies involved in the motor insurance industry providing motor cover have had an underwriting loss, which equated to approximately £16 million, an increase of 10% on the figure for the previous year. Worse than that, which makes it very difficult for me as Minister with responsibility for commerce, they had an investment loss which was 16% greater than the figure for the previous year. This is the first time they have had an investment loss, which compounds the problem pertaining to the necessary liquidity and reserves which I, as regulator in the insurance area, am obliged to ensure they have available to meet the liabilities that must be honoured in the event of the claims submitted. That is a serious situation for the industry. I cleared that report today and it should be available in the next few weeks. It is against that background that I have a responsibility to ensure that the companies provide cover and that they have the necessary reserves, liquidity and proper ratios to meet the claims submitted.</P>
    <P>Given that this is a small country with an open economy in which the number of motor vehicles increased from 828,000 in 1996 to approximately 1.28 million today, it is difficult to resolve the issue of the high cost of motor insurance. I am hopeful that when the Motor Insurance Industry Advisory Board reports we will be able to proceed on the basis of some of its recommendations which, when implemented, will hopefully mitigate against and reduce the high cost of insurance as it is a major problem facing young motorists, in <Col N="517" /> particular, and public representatives. I hope, collectively, those in the political and parliamentary systems can assist in introducing a new policy which will take a good deal of effort, education, imparting of information, a change of culture in terms of our attitude to road safety and careful motor management to ensure that motor premiums are reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Returning to the issue of genetic testing, the Minister of State said that the insurance industry will introduce a code of conduct, which I welcome. Can he give a commitment that we will not go down the road of the Insurance Ombudsman in relation to such a code of conduct? I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the history of the Insurance Ombudsman. I hope we will not witness a repeat of that. Voluntary codes of conduct are the best option if they can be introduced and enforced within the industry. The introduction of a voluntary code of conduct in line with establishing the Insurance Ombudsman on a statutory basis may be the avenue to go. I hope we will not see a repeat of the situation where the Insurance Ombudsman had to resign. I appreciate the Minister of State's officials are more up to speed on that matter than I am.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of voluntary testing, if voluntary testing is offered and individuals do not proceed with it, they may be discriminated against in policy terms. For example, if a man has Huntington's disease and is offered a voluntary test by an insurance company but declines to take it, that could be construed by the insurance company to mean that he has already taken such a test and discovered he has Huntington's disease and he could be discriminated against <i>vis-à-vis</i> another person who has taken the test. Discussing this issue highlights the fact that this area is a can of worms as it is difficult to say this is where something starts and this is where something stops. I hope the Minister of State will be extremely careful in relation to that matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said he is examining the position on genetic testing in other European countries, or perhaps I misheard him. If that is the case, does he intend to introduce legislation to protect individuals, as sadly &ndash; I made a similar point during the debate on the Patents Bill a few weeks ago &ndash; this country lags very much behind in having in place a proper legislative framework to cover many ethical issues. I hope that the Minister of State who has responsibility for science and technology will examine this area. Irrespective of whether we are dealing with genetic engineering, cloning or in vitro fertilisation, we have dragged our heels in introducting legislation in those areas. Is it the Minister of State's intention to introduce legislation to protect people in relation to the new advances in genetic testing for particular diseases? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a medical doctor, would be more qualified to speak <Col N="518" /> on this than I am. As Minister of State with responsibility for science I suggest that this genetic area has not evolved far enough for us to make a decision as to what we should do. Ethics, research and health are all involved in this wide area. Deputies will know the Government established an interdepartmental committee on this area and that report has now been published and is available as a fine document. We much give consideration to that also, although the debate is in its embryonic stage; we are about 25% of the way through this debate. To answer Deputy Naughten's question, we will examine the legislation of those countries which have passed legislation concerning genetic testing. The fact that the IIF has brought forward a voluntary code gives us time to decide on appropriate action or if action is required.</P>
      <P>I do not see a situation whereby we have to involve the Ombudsman. That is a matter for the industry and for consumers as to whether they want to go down that route regarding a particular matter. However, the code, as it is evolving in discussions with our officials, is very clear and forbids the industry from forcing someone to take a genetic test to get insurance cover. It also forbids the industry from giving special concessions to those who voluntarily undertake genetic testing. It respects the cross-community system and all consumers are being treated equally. I am confident about the strong commitment in the voluntary code. The industry which is self-regulatory has a strong record of adhering to its rules and regulations. While we regulate the industry overall, the industry must regulate its management systems, attitudes, criteria and actuarial considerations. So far the discussions are very positive and I am confident at the end of the day that the protection of the consumer is paramount and that the industry accepts that.</P>

      <P>This proposal was discussed on Committee Stage in the Seanad and these amendments provide that registers maintained by the supervisory authority and the product producers be held in electronic form, taking into account what we have already referred to, that information in future can and may be held in electronic form.</P>
      <P>The first amendment provides that the supervisory authority shall maintain the register or registers in electronic form or in another form if it considers that appropriate. I understand the supervisory authority intends to publish the register on the Central Bank's website.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25 of the 1995 Act defines an investment product intermediary. Those so defined are required to go through a formal process of authorisation. This amendment seeks to make such a process of authorisation unnecessary in the case of two types of tied agent. The first category comprises tied insurance agents, for whom an undertaking takes full and unconditional responsibility. Since the authorised undertaking is prepared to take that responsibility, the consumer can then deal confidently with intermediaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second category covers credit institutions when dealing as tied agents. Since those insti<Col N="520" /> tutions are already subject to an authorisation process, a second one would be redundant. Consequently, instead of having duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy, we have introduced this amendment to clarify the situation.</P>

      <P>The original drafting of this section reflects the language of the Insurance Act, 1989. The intention of this Bill is somewhat different and here the intention is to establish absolute clarity, not least for the benefit of the client, that receipts must issue when, and only when, there has been a payment of some kind. Accordingly, the amendment to lines 15 to 17 makes it clear that receipts are to be issued where payment has been made.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5), now to be deleted, provided for circumstances in the past where an intermediary did not have to issue a receipt where a policy of insurance was being issued in return for a payment. However, to provide absolute clarity to clients and consistency, the Seanad accepted my amendment so a receipt is required in all instances where a payment is made. We will come to this later in the Bill also and we will see this is necessary for sustainability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The deletion of &ldquo;or&rdquo; is necessary to facilitate the amendment, which allows intermediaries to handle cash. The issue of cash handling by certain intermediaries has been the subject of much discussion and debate in recent years. I promised on Report Stage in the Dáil to give further consideration to the matter in the light of the points made during that debate. Accordingly, I brought forward this amendment to provide for both life assurance intermediaries and non-life insurance intermediaries to be permitted to handle cash provided that circumstances in section 25(<i>g</i>) applied. That section provides that a premium paid to an intermediary shall be treated as having been paid to an undertaking when it is in respect of a renewal invited by the undertaking or a new proposal accepted by the undertaking. Thus, when an intermediary handles cash in these circumstances, the insurer is taking responsibility for the handling of that cash. The provision as now drafted permits intermediaries to handle cash without having to demonstrate capital adequacy while safeguarding the interests of consumers. In the case of tied agents the consumer is safeguarded because the insurer is responsible for any act or omission of its tied insurance agent in respect of any matter relating <Col N="522" /> to a contract of insurance offered or issued by the undertaking with which the tied agency agreement relates. This has been welcomed broadly by the intermediaries and is something which both Houses were anxious to achieve. We gave it a great deal of soul searching and time and effort, we had a great deal of consultation and now we think it is to the satisfaction of everybody.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage in the Seanad, concerns were expressed about the freedom of restricted activity investment product intermediaries to offer advice to their clients. This amendment seeks to make clear that when an intermediary has had a discussion with a client in the context of the anti-churning provisions of the Insurance Act and involving any existing life policies held by that client, the Investment Intermediaries Act does not prevent that discussion. The extent to which an intermediary gives advice is determined by their own status. Investment product intermediaries authorised under section 10 of the 1995 Act have to fulfil three conditions. They must demonstrate that they are competent to offer wide ranging advice &ndash; a little like politicians &ndash; they must demonstrate they have adequate capital to run their business &ndash; not like politicians, we do not have the capital mostly &ndash; and they must submit to a strict supervisory regime involving quarterly reporting. The purpose of this is to ensure that such intermediaries are solvent and in a position to meet their obligations to their clients. This regime permits the consumer to seek wide-ranging advice, confident that their investment is secure. Any intermediary can fulfil these conditions and fulfilling these conditions may seek this status and is then free to offer wide-ranging advice. Restricted activities activity intermediaries by contrast do not have to fulfil these conditions. Nevertheless, they may offer advice on the products of the product producers with whom they hold appointments. This amendment permits them now to discuss with their clients any insurance policies that their client may already hold. While this amendment does not meet all the requirements of restricted activity investment product intermediaries, it goes a long way to meet their concerns without compromising the interests of consumers. It gives them the right to give independent advice and I am confident, therefore, that this amendment is acceptable to the House.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. We tried to find a balance here to protect the consumer and allow for the flexibility of advice. Again, it is important that we protect the consumer, especially in relation to the issue of <Col N="524" /> churning which the Minister mentioned, whereby many innocent bystanders take out a policy, then there is a new improved policy available and they are told it is the best thing since sliced bread and of course it is only for the practice of churning. It is important we get the balance and we have it within this Bill. I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>This matter had been raised in the Dáil and later in the Seanad. I re-examined the matter in the light of the debate and brought forward this amendment to the Seanad. The original provision of this Bill excluded travel agents and tour operators from the scope of Part 4 of the 1995 Act because they are already subject to a regime of authorisation and bonding under the Transport Act of 1982. I have now decided to provide that they will be subject to the requirement to issue receipts when transacting insurance business. Accordingly, I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Naughten's agreement. We gave this a great deal of thought and consideration. The difficulty is that our Department does not control the travel agents or the travel industry. Consequently, by and large, their business is travel and looking after people's travel requirements. Insurance is ancillary to that. The best I could do was separate the two by insuring there is an absolute <i>de facto</i> receipt for the insurance cover made available to each consumer. That will assist transparency for the consumer and provide a guarantee also that the cover is available.</P>

      <P>As the first two items relate to the British Army Board they will be taken together. Each Deputy will have five minutes and the Minister or Minister of State will have ten minutes in which to reply. Deputy Keaveney has given notice of her intention to raise the matter of the recent decision by the British Army Board to reject applications to discharge Guardsmen James Fisher and Mark Douglas Wright from the British Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important matter. I thank Deputy Currie from the Fine Gael Party <Col N="527" /> and Deputy Quinn from the Labour Party for their support on this issue.</P>
      <P>After 30 years of violence in the North we have witnessed hundreds of murders, shootings, bombings and beatings, all of them shocking, brutal and disturbing. In some cases, the perpetrators have been caught, in others they have gone undetected. One of the inherent elements of the Good Friday Agreement is prisoner releases, a bitter pill for many people to swallow but generally an accepted and necessary part of achieving a lasting peace in the North.</P>
      <P>This is not about the early release of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright but their reinstatement into the British Army after shooting dead 18 year old Peter McBride on the New Lodge Road area of North Belfast. It is about justice, democracy, the worth and value of a young Catholic man's life in the eyes of the British Army and the British Government. It is an issue that must be addressed on the floor of this House as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>On 4 September 1992, Peter McBride, an 18 year old father of two, was stopped by a foot patrol of the Scots Guards in Spamount Street off the New Lodge Road in Belfast. After an identity check and a thorough body search which found him to be unarmed, Peter ran from the patrol and was chased by the soldiers. They called upon him to stop but he did not. At this point, Guardsmen Wright and Fisher opened fire on Peter McBride. Two bullets struck him in the back, killing him.</P>
      <P>At their trial in 1995, the judge, Lord Justice Kelly, a former member of the Northern Ireland Parliament and a former Attorney General of the Unionist Government at Stormont, found that Fisher and Wright had been both evasive and untruthful in their evidence and that they both lied about material aspects of the case. In particular, he was satisfied that they had seen Peter McBride being searched by their commander. He regarded Fisher's defence that he believed Peter McBride to be carrying a coffee jar bomb in a white paper or plastic bag to be untruthful. Justice Kelly stated:</P>
      <P>I am satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility that Guardsman Fisher held or may have held an honest belief that the deceased carried or may have carried a coffee jar bomb.</P>
      <P>Peter McBride was retreating from them, all the time increasing the distance between them. He also found that the incident was not a panic situation requiring a split second decision or a split second action, if any action was required at all. Further, the trial judge found that the two soldiers had aimed deliberate shots at Peter McBride who posed no threat to them. Both soldiers' defence was thoroughly discredited. The Northern Ireland Court of Appeal heard the soldiers' appeals and conducted a lengthy review of the cases. Both appeals were unanimously dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fisher and Wright were released in September <Col N="528" /> 1998 and flown to Catterick barracks in Yorkshire to meet their commanding officer. The following month the Army Board decided that both men could continue their careers in the services under an exceptional circumstances clause. According to the Army Board they had committed only an error of judgment.</P>
    <P>In 1999, Mrs. McBride applied to the High Court for leave to challenge the Army Board's decision and was granted a judicial review. In this regard, Justice Kerr gave judgment that a new Army Board must be constituted to reconsider the future of the guardsmen. Finally, in November this year, the new board found that the two guardsmen should be allowed to remain in the army. This decision, given the facts I have outlined, is unbelievable. It is a decision which has been condemned by the Independent Assessor of Military Complaints and the Catholic Primate, Dr. Seán Brady. While human rights organisations in the North, including the Pat Finucance Centre and the Human Rights Commission have outlined their concern, the political parties here tonight have united to condemn this decision which is an affront to justice and democracy.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that over the past couple of years Guardsmen Fisher and Wright have not been confined to pen pushing or other such duties but rather have been sent to serve in war torn Kosovo. It is also worth pointing out that, since 1995, 1,406 soldiers have been tried for drug related offences and discharged from the army. What does this say about the British Army's priorities? </P>
    <P>We can take away a number of implicit points from the decision of the Army Board to allow these two men to continue to serve in the British Army &ndash; the murder of a young Catholic man on the streets of Belfast is not as heinous or serious a crime as smoking drugs and you can kill a citizen in Northern Ireland and be deemed fit to serve in other areas of conflict. This decision is, quite frankly, a disgrace. It has served to devalue human life in Northern Ireland. It has served to discredit the British armed forces and has caused further grief and anguish for the family of Peter McBride.</P>
    <P>At a time when people talk about confidence building measures, mutual respect and human rights, I call upon the British Government to examine this decision. It is both insensitive and unjust. The McBride family deserve better. Ordinary members of the public reliant on the protection of the British Army deserve better. Mr. Justice Kerr clearly stated:</P>
    <P>The public has a legitimate interest in whether those who have been convicted of murder should be allowed to continue to serve as members of the armed forces.</P>
    <P>I call for the reversal of this decision and the immediate discharge of both Wright and Fisher from the British armed forces.</P>
    <Col N="529" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to share in what is effectively a motion representing a united front on both sides of the House on this issue.</P>
      <P>The murder of Peter McBride in the New Lodge area of Belfast was that of a young man of 18 years, unarmed, shot in the back in circumstances in which the two soldiers who perpetrated the murder were not under attack and could justify their actions by a plea of losing their heads in a situation of intense pressure, nor was it accidental. The two soldiers were sentenced to life imprisonment but were released after serving only six years and were allowed to rejoin their regiment, the Scots Guards. Both these aspects of the case provoked outrage from the relatives and friends of the murdered youth and a large section of the Nationalist community &ndash; the release after such a minimal period and being accepted back into the Army.</P>
      <P>The decision by the Army Board to retain the two soldiers was quashed at a Belfast court on the application of Mrs. McBride. The Army Board revisited the case and now Mrs. McBride is to seek a declaration again on the grounds that it is mandatory to discharge soldiers imprisoned by a civil court unless there are exceptional reasons. What could be the exceptional reasons that would justify again giving guns to people who murdered with them in the past? Among them, apparently, was the youth and relative inexperience of the soldiers at the time they committed the crime in 1992 and that they had no previous criminal records and had learned a bitter and lasting lesson.</P>
      <P>I am not one for recrimination, vindictiveness or seeking revenge as distinct from justice. I accept that people can be guilty of the most serious offences and yet be rehabilitated, to sincerely regret what they have been responsible for and to lead responsible and even lives of service to the community. The Good Friday Agreement had this hope and commitment at its core. Hundreds of men, some guilty of the most heinous and brutal crimes, have been released, many with years of their sentences still to serve. Deputy Keaveney and I are not arguing that Mark Wright and James Fisher should be returned to prison. They have their freedom and, in the circumstances of the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement, that is their entitlement. However, being allowed back into the British Army to carry guns and be put back into the position where they committed murder in the past is a different matter.</P>
      <P>Scottish regiments serve in Northern Ireland. We hope the day will soon come when they will no longer be with us. The success of the peace process will ensure that men with arms will no longer be part of the scene in Northern Ireland but that day, unfortunately, is not yet. What assurances have we and, even if we had, what credence would we give them, that these two men will not patrol the streets of Northern Ireland? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from Northern Ireland, there are other parts of the world where British troops interface <Col N="530" /> with local populations in places such as the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, Africa and elsewhere and possibly even side by side with our soldiers in the new European rapid reaction force. Should any self-respecting army allow in its ranks, particularly in sensitive situations, men who have been responsible for cold blooded murder in the past? </P>
    <P>There is the question of sensitivity. What message does the continued employment of these convicted killers in the so-called forces of law and order give to ordinary citizens in Northern Ireland, particularly those in the Nationalist community, that they can place their trust and confidence in those responsible for protecting life and property? That is a crucial issue and I hope this decision will be revisited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Keaveney and Currie for raising this important issue. I join them in deploring the recent decision by the British Army Board to reject applications to discharge Guardsmen Fisher and Wright from the British Army and its direction that they be permitted to continue their army service.</P>
      <P>It is now over eight years since Peter McBride was murdered near his home in the New Lodge area of north Belfast by two soldiers &ndash; Guardsmen Fisher and Wright &ndash; who were serving with the Ist Battalion Scots Guards. Peter, who was just 18 years old, was stopped by the soldiers on patrol and, when he ran away, was pursued through a number of streets before being shot in the back.</P>
      <P>The two soldiers, James Fisher and Mark Wright, were charged with murder the day after the shooting. Their trial took place in 1994. The trial judge, Lord Justice Kelly, found that Fisher and Wright had been both &ldquo;evasive and untruthful&rdquo; in their evidence and that they both lied about material aspects of the case. He did not believe Fisher's defence that he believed Peter McBride to be carrying a coffee jar bomb. He also found that the incident was not a panic situation requiring a split-second decision or a split-second action and concluded that the two soldiers had aimed deliberate shots at Peter McBride, who posed no threat to them at all. Both soldiers were convicted of murder in February 1995. On 27 November of that year, their convictions were upheld on appeal by the then Lord Chief Justice, Sir Brian Hutton.</P>
      <P>Following strong representations from supporters of the soldiers, including an intensive campaign in parts of the British media, the then Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, announced in July 1998 that she would review the soldiers' cases and, following that review, they were released on 2 September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The McBride family campaigned &ndash; through the Pat Finucane Centre &ndash; for the two guardsmen to receive a dishonourable discharge from the army. However, on 3 November of that year, an Army Board decided to retain them in the <Col N="531" /> Army because of &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;. The Army board stated that, in reaching its decision, it had taken account,<i> inter alia</i>, of the following circumstances: that the guardsmen &ldquo;had shown contrition for their action which they admitted was an error of judgment; that they had paid the price for their action with a lengthy prison sentence during which time their behaviour had been exemplary; their continued loyalty to the army and their previously unblemished military records; and finally their wish to continue serving their country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following, the board decision, the family continued its campaign to have the soldiers discharged from the British Army. As well as having the support of human rights groups and non-governmental organisations such as the Pat Finucane Centre in Derry, the family has the support of elected representatives in this House, in Britain and in Northern Ireland in their campaign. The Taoiseach met the family in December 1998 and reiterated his support for them and his understanding of their concerns. During that meeting, the McBrides stressed that what was important for them was not that the soldiers had been released, but that they had been retained in the British Army.</P>
    <P>The Independent Assessor of Military Complaints Procedures, in his 1998 report, included strong criticism of the Army Board decision to reinstate the soldiers and referred to the negative impact such a decision would have on Nationalist confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The McBride family applied for a judicial review of the army board decision in February 1999 and in September of that year, Mr. Justice Kerr granted them a judicial review into the decision on the basis that the army board could not have found that the guardsmen's actions were a result of an &ldquo;error of judgment&rdquo;, if as the board claimed, it accepted the findings of the trial judge, Lord Justice Kelly.</P>
    <P>The British Secretary of State for Defence, Geoffrey Hoon, responded that, having considered the outcome of the judicial review in detail and having accepted its conclusion that the Army Board decision was, in one respect, flawed, the Army Board would consider the case completely afresh.</P>
    <P>The newly reconstituted board spent 14 months considering the case, during which the delay in bringing the case to a conclusion caused increasing concern and distress to the McBrides. Through the British-Irish Secretariat in Belfast, officials of my Department raised our concern at the delay with the British Government on a number of occasions. On 24 November last, the family of Peter McBride was informed that Fisher and Wright are to be retained in the British Army. On that day, our disappointment and dismay at the decision was conveyed to the British authorities through the secretariat in Belfast. We also <Col N="532" /> asked what means of redress are available to the family and await a response.</P>
    <P>Understandably, there has been immediate and widespread criticism of the British Army Board decision. Mrs. Jean McBride, Peter's mother, said that she &ldquo;was completely devastated by the decision&rdquo;. The Independent Assessor for Military complaints, Jim McDonald, said that the two guardsmen were convicted of murder and that in his view, there was no room for murderers in the army. He said that he too was absolutely dismayed by the decision of the Army Board, which sent a very negative message to the people of Northern Ireland and to the McBride family.</P>
    <P>I note that in a statement of 24 November, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, said that the decision was entirely a matter for the Army Board. He added that he had suggested to the Secretary of State for Defence that &ldquo;given the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for Fisher and Wright to serve in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  The Secretary of State confirmed that the Secretary of State for Defence has agreed.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that on 5 December, the Northern Ireland Assembly debated an SDLP motion condemning the decision to retain the two guardsmen. The SDLP considered it incredible that the reconstituted Army board could properly have come once again to the decision to retain two convicted murderers in the army. Sinn Féin, in supporting the motion, considered that double standards applied in making the decision. While he did not reflect general Unionist views on the issue, the Ulster Unionist Assembly member, Duncan Shipley-Dalton, supported the motion and, as a former member of the Royal Irish Regiment, expressed very grave concern at the retention of the two soldiers. During the same debate, the Alliance Party described the decision to retain the two soldiers as wrong and said that it was &ldquo;both insensitive and counterproductive, as it could bring the forces of law and order into disrepute&rdquo;. The Northern Ireland Women's Coalition expressed concern that, as work continues to build confidence in the Army and other security services, the decision could imply that the army is above the law and it said that &ldquo;people are right to have high expectations of the security forces&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have maintained contact with representatives of the McBride family. On the day the Army Board decision was made public, they conveyed to Mrs. McBride my disappointment at the decision to retain the two guardsmen as well my sympathy for the family. An official of my Department will be meeting Mrs. McBride shortly to discuss the case and to examine how we can further assist the family. I welcome the fact that the family has been granted a judicial review of the Army Board decision in Belfast's High Court on 19 December and I commend their determination to see a just outcome to this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> At a time when we are seeking to build and sustain Nationalist confidence in the new beginning promised in the Good Friday Agreement, I am deeply disturbed by the decision to retain as serving members of the British Army two men who have been convicted in a court of law of the murder of Peter McBride. As the Independent Assessor of Military Complaints said, that decision sends a negative message to the people of Northern Ireland and to the McBride family. If we are to move forward, as we must, it is vital that the security forces must not only uphold, but be seen to uphold, the best standards demanded in a democratic society.</P>
    <P>I once again thank and commend Deputies Keaveney and Currie, assure them that I will continue to take a close and personal interest in the case and commend their motion to the House.</P>

The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, stated in reply to a Dáil Question of 28 November that his Department was in contact with the British authorities immediately after the British Chancellor's announcement but that no details were available other than the very broad outline in the Commons speech.</P>
      <P>The proposed charge has already become popularly known, or should I say unpopularly known, as the &ldquo;Brit. disc&rdquo;. Even from the broad outline, it is clear that it would be a penalty on Irish hauliers. Chancellor Brown referred to introducing the system in Britain and for British roads but, unless we are otherwise informed, it has to be assumed this would apply not just to the island of Britain, but to the Six Counties, which remain for the moment at least under Chancellor Brown's jurisdiction. In this jurisdiction, therefore, Irish hauliers will be subjected to an imposition which will be uniquely punitive, the vast majority of them having to pass through Britain, and in many cases the North of Ireland also, to get to the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that 80% of truckers from the Twenty Six counties regularly travel to or pass through the Six Counties and or Britain. Trade with other EU countries is predominantly by that route. The Irish Road Haulage Association has stated that the &ldquo;Brit. disc&rdquo; would impose crippling extra costs on the trucking industry, with approximately 16,000 vehicles operating out of <Col N="534" /> the Twenty Six counties being subject to the charge.</P>
    <P>The proposed &ldquo;Brit. disc&rdquo; would be in clear breach of EU freedom of movement regulations and would hit truckers in the Twenty Six counties hardest. We have been involved in developing EU highways which are supposed to facilitate trade across the Continent, including these islands. Our ports are being upgraded for this purpose. A British charge on Irish trade runs totally contrary to these developments. If this charge is to go ahead and if it is to apply to hauliers travelling across the Border, it would represent an attack on Irish trade. We are trying to build all-Ireland and cross-Border trade in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and we are faced with an outrageous proposal which would re-enforce the artificial frontier. In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, and that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there are hundreds of hauliers who would be directly affected. At a time when physical barriers with our neighbouring counties have been lifted, this charge would be a fiscal barrier.</P>
    <P>I have already raised this matter with Inter-Trade Ireland, the all-Ireland trade body established under the Good Friday Agreement. It has been conducting road shows around the Twenty Six Counties in recent months to encourage cross-Border trade. A proposal such as Gordon Brown's runs totally contrary to its work also.</P>
    <P>The reply from the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, on 28 November did not mention the implications for Ireland of Gordon Brown's plans.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance here this evening and I urge him to ensure the British Government is left in no doubt about the universal Irish position to this proposal. The &ldquo;Brit. disc&rdquo; must be strongly resisted by the Irish Government and Mr. Brown must be made to think again.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced recently in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom is considering the introduction of road user charges in respect of heavy goods vehicles. This is seen as a response to criticism by some British hauliers that while they are obliged to pay motorway tolls in mainland Europe, foreign vehicles are allowed to use the British motorway network toll-free.</P>
      <P>Apart from some tunnels and bridges, the motorway network in Britain has been toll-free since its inception. Any tolls currently applied to bridges and tunnels in Britain apply to all users, regardless of the nationality of the user.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A European Council directive, which came into force in January 1995, allows member states to charge minimum rates of tolls and or user charges on motorways, and roads of motorway standard, for goods vehicles of 12 tonnes and over. The <Col N="535" /> rates of user charges are related to the duration of the use made of the infrastructure and differentiated in relation to the costs caused by the road vehicles.</P>
    <P>The directive lays down specific terms under which tolls and user charges may be imposed. They may only be imposed on users of motorways or other multi-lane roads with characteristics similar to motorways, or users of bridges, tunnels and mountain passes. The charges applicable are outlined in a 1999 directive. Charges can vary in relation to the number of axles, the gross weight and the pollution rating of the vehicle's engine. Vehicles with lower gross weights, especially those with road friendly suspension, would have to pay considerably less than these amounts.</P>
    <P>Five member states, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, already impose user charges in respect of their motorway networks. There is a single user charge for the five member state regions, known as the Eurovignette. This avoids the need for separate payments when crossing from one country to another within the Eurovignette area. Eurovignettes may be purchased at post offices, truck stops and other outlets near the borders and in the ports of entry and must be displayed prominently on the front of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>Tolls and user charges may not discriminate directly or indirectly, or on the grounds of the nationality of the haulier, or the origin or destination of the vehicle. Where these tolls or user charges apply, they apply to all goods vehicles over 12 tonnes, engaged in national or international haulage, regardless of the haulier's nationality. Any proposal to introduce user charges in the UK would have to comply with EU laws as regards non-discrimination and would have to apply equally to UK registered and foreign registered vehicles. If Britain decides to apply the terms of the directive to its motorway network, vehicles registered in Britain would have to pay the same user charges applied to non-UK registered hauliers for the use of the UK national motorway network.</P>
    <P>My Department was in touch with the British authorities immediately after the Chancellor's announcement. However, no further details of the proposed scheme, other than the very broad outline in the Chancellor's statement to the House of Commons, have become available.</P>
    <P>I will continue to monitor the developments closely to ensure that any moves to introduce road user charges are fair and non-discriminatory. I will keep the Deputy informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the way in which the Government has dealt with appointments to the Human Rights Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Human Rights Commission is a very important organisation. Its establishment arises <Col N="536" /> from the Good Friday Agreement and it is governed by the UN Paris principles. I am very concerned, as are many organisations, that in way in which appointments to the commission have been announced the issues of accountability and process have been disregarded. I will raise a number of points in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a cut and paste approach to appointments to the Human Rights Commission. This is demeaning and humiliating to those already appointed and to those who may yet be appointed. There were reports yesterday of a corrective climbdown. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about this. If it is true, it is a belated admission by the Minister that, despite written advance warnings to him from Fine Gael, he still got it completely wrong.</P>
    <P>The ICCL has rightly said that the Government showed a total disregard for the process of transparency in the appointments mechanism which it only accepted with the greatest reluctance following considerable pressure from the human rights sector. I have a letter signed by a group of NGOs who support this view. The distinguished selection committee for members which advised the Minister was chaired by Dr. Whitaker. It included prominent activists in the human rights and voluntary sectors. It shortlisted 16 people out of 177 applicants, and recommended eight people with unanimous priority. The Minister then asked only one of these eight to join the commission. This was a contemptuous way to treat Dr. Whitaker and his committee and, indeed, the entire procedure. Why set up a procedure like this if one is going to subvert in the final analysis?</P>
    <P>Already it has been reported that one of the eight people appointed by the Minister is considering her position, presumably because she is deeply embarrassed by the Minister's clumsy and inept handling of the issue. Does this mean resignations before the commission, a vitally important body, in terms of civil and individual rights, even begins its work? To compound the situation, Mr. Justice Barrington also said last weekend that he was surprised at the appointments process.</P>
    <P>Why did the Government ignore the recommendations of the selection committee and why has the Minister failed to give reasons for their actions last week? What view was taken by the selection committee on the applications of the four nominees added to the list by the Government? Does the Government intend to take some action to change the situation or will it remain as it is?</P>
    <P>The belated course correction, if it is true, seems to suggest that people he has already appointed are not good enough and, therefore, need new colleagues, and yet those likely new colleagues were not deemed good enough by him the first time around to merit appointment. It is typical of the Minister that neither the original announcement of the Human Rights Commission last week nor his proposals put forward yesterday can be found on his Department's website.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> I am appalled that such an important body, with such huge implications for human and civil rights, the Human Rights Commission, has been handled in this way by the Government. It suggests that, despite all the scandals this year, nothing has been learned about appointments to public bodies and the need for transparency and openness. The Government set up a procedure which it then did not follow. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is unable to attend the House tonight. Deputies will be aware that he is engaged abroad in the signing of the UN Convention to Combat Transnational Organised Crime.</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, provides that the Human Rights Commission will have nine members including its president, and it specifies that at least four members of the commission will be men and that at least four members will be women. The Act also emphasises the importance of pluralism in the making of such appointments and it stipulates, in line with a requirement in the 1993 UN Paris Principles and the 1995 UN guidelines, that the members of such commissions should have a background in, or connection with, human rights. Specifically, the Act states that no one can be appointed to the commission unless, in the Government's opinion, they have such relevant experience, qualifications, training or expertise in the general area of human rights issues which are of concern to the commission. The Government, in making these appointments, must also have regard to the need to ensure that membership of the commission also reflects the nature of Irish society.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, governs the position regarding appointments to the Human Rights Commission, and it provides that all nine members, including the president of the commission, are to be appointed by the Government. The Government has already appointed Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, the distinguished former judge of the Supreme Court and of the Court of First Instance of the European Court of Justice, to be president of the commission.</P>
      <P>In so far as the ordinary members of the commission are concerned, a selection committee was established under the chairmanship of Dr. TK Whitaker to draw up a list of possible candidates, who were to be considered by the Government for appointment. The other members of the committee were: Ms Inez McCormack, president of ICTU and member of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission; Mr. Frank Murray, former Secretary General to the Government and now a member of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission; Ms Mary Murphy, nominated by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul; and Mr. Martin O'Brien, director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> As already announced, the Government offered appointments to the eight positions of part-time commissioner on the commission to the following persons: Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, professor of law, University of Ulster, member of ICCL, who has been involved in several international human rights cases at the European Court of Human Rights and the International Court of Justice; William Binchy, professor of law, Trinity College, Dublin; Olive Braiden, former director of the Rape Crisis Centre and currently a member of the Courts Service Board; Robert Daly, professor and chairman of the department of psychiatry, UCC, and member of the Southern Health Board, former member of Amnesty International advisory board and currently consultant to that board and founder member Cork Travellers' Support Group; Suzanne Egan, lecturer in human rights law, UCD, former executive member of the Irish Refugee Council and founding member of the Refugee Protection Policy Group; Jane Liddy, former member of the European Commission on Human Rights; Tom O'Higgins, chairman of Concern Worldwide and previously senior partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers; and Meryvn Taylor, solicitor and former Minister for Equality and Law Reform and currently the Irish member of the European Monitoring Committee on Racism and Xenophobia.</P>
    <P>Four of those nominated and offered appointment were drawn from the list of persons recommended by the selection committee. The Deputy might have thought it was only one of them but it was actually four.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Four of those nominated and offered appointment were drawn from the list of persons recommended by the selection committee. The other four were chosen by the Government on the basis of its judgment as to the overall combination of talents and skills that would best provide human rights development and protection for the public generally in all its diversity.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, fundamentally the responsibility and obligation of the Government itself to make that judgment. The fact that the Government had available to it the very excellent recommendations of the selection committee &ndash; and this applies to all recommendations made to all Governments &ndash; did not mean that it was precluded from making its own judgment as to what combination of skills and talents was required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, however, the Minister made it absolutely clear in a statement made at a major human rights conference on Saturday last that the Government would, of course, listen to what others had to say about the human rights framework proposed. He made it clear that he was very much aware of comments that had been made <Col N="539" /> about the nominations and that it was his intention to approach with an open mind the suggestions which were being made concerning the appointments in the context of the general human rights framework which is now in the process of being established. He said:</P>
    <P>If we need to change anything, or we need to do more, then we must look at all the options. It would be entirely inconsistent for us to say, on the one hand, that we are at the beginning of a new phase in human rights protection, that we genuinely want to approach the task in the right way, but, at the same time, to say that we have now put it all together, that all is &ldquo;done and dusted&rdquo;, and that we will not <Col N="540" /> listen to what anybody else has to say about the way forward.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the Minister has now decided that he should respond to suggestions from various groups and individuals for a further widening of the range of interests to be represented on the proposed commission. He is considering the matter at present and he hopes to be in a position to present proposals to the Government next week. The excellent work and recommendations of the selection committee will clearly be of further value to the Government in considering how it should approach the task of widening the range of interests on the committee.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 December 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department has been directly involved in activities to tackle the problems of moneylending and over-indebtedness since 1988 and has been funding the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, programme since 1992. At present the Department is supporting 50 MABS projects, thereby providing a service countrywide.</P>
      <P>Each local MABS project is managed by a committee drawn from local voluntary and statutory services and community groups and operates in partnership with other relevant agencies. The projects are independent information and advice providers, rooted in the local community.</P>
      <P>The MABS budget has grown from £260,000, six projects, in 1992 to £4,542,000, 50 projects, in 2000. The successes of the service are clear to see.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to bring forward very shortly proposals to Government for the establishment of the MABS on a statutory basis with a view to publishing a Bill in mid 2001. This Bill will provide a firm legislative framework for the future development of the service in a structured and effective manner while being sufficiently flexible to support the voluntary management, the sense of community ownership and the independence which are the corner stones of the service. I should stress that I have consulted with the MABS national advisory committee, comprising representatives of all MABS stakeholders, in determining the precise form of my proposals for legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>The role of the MABS is to provide advice on money management and through its links with the credit unions to provide access to low cost credit for its clients. Special accounts are administered by the credit unions on behalf of MABS clients. A MABS client who has a special account facility can, in certain circumstances, access a loan from their credit union which is guaranteed by a fund, called the loan guarantee fund, lodged by the MABS in the relevant credit union. The MABS does not disburse funding to individuals. It was never envisaged that it would do so as it would be contrary to its underlying objectives.</P>

      <P>The Government's Families First approach is designed to make families central to policy making and the development of services. In 2001 Government investment in the development of a range of family services in my Department will amount to more than £16.5 million compared with £1.5 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>The new and greatly expanded services developed over the past three years include the family mediation service which is now available from eleven centres nationwide, up from two in 1997; a greatly improved grant aid programme for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling, £4.81 million in 2001; the introduction of some 67 family and community services resource centres which provide community based support programmes for families, up from ten in 1997; a £5 million allocation to provide out of school hours services for children, and family services pilot projects in Finglas, Waterford and Togher and Mahon in Cork, providing high quality information on a range of services to families.</P>
      <P>Strengthening families and the promotion of continuity and stability in family life, the welfare of children and support and affirmation for parents in carrying out their important child rearing responsibilities are core features of the pro-families policy approach. A family affairs unit has been established at my Department with a range of responsibilities relating to the development of family policies and services in line with this approach.</P>
      <P>The importance of accessible information about parenting issues and child development to strengthen the capacity of families in carrying out their essential functions of caring for children was highlighted by the Commission on the Family. The family affairs unit in consultation with the Department of Health and Children is exploring what would be involved in the development of such an information programme.</P>
      <P>Consultations have been initiated with key interests including child care and family support organisations and professional child health and welfare bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research is under way under the families research programme on a number of themes highly relevant to parenting, including, Effective Parenting &ndash; An Exploration of Need, this project involves a survey of 1000 parents and 200 children; Strengthening Families through Fathers, this research will provide up to date information on the role, involvement, and caring work of vulnerable fathers in families in need, and Grandparenthood in Modern Ireland, which will pro<Col N="543" /> vide information about the important supports provided by the extended family.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is working closely with the national conjoint child health committee, established under the health boards, which is exploring the support needs of parents in promoting children's health gain and well being.</P>
    <P>The deliberations of this expert group and the outcome over the next six months of the various research projects will be critical to the development by my Department of a programme of parent information which is affirmative of parents skills and strengths, builds confidence in families and keeps children's welfare centre stage &ndash;  an approach which is endorsed by the national children's strategy recently launched by the Government.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to announce details of a pilot programme in mid-2001.</P>

      <P>Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure across the different EU member states.</P>
      <P>As well as encompassing social welfare expenditure, social protection expenditure, as defined by Eurostat, also covers expenditure in other areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes, e.g. certain FÁS programmes, and other social exclusion programmes. This is clearly a very different definition to &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; as we understand it in this country.</P>
      <P>The latest year for which this information is available in 1998, and so it does not take into account the very substantial increases in social welfare payments which this Government introduced in 1999 and 2000. Neither, of course, does it take account of the record increases for 2001 which we announced in last week's budget.</P>
      <P>I am, however, arranging to have the Eurostat table circulated with the official report. It shows that social protection &ndash; broadly defined, as set out above &ndash; in Ireland represents a lower proportion of GDP than the EU average: the proportion in Ireland is 16%, compared to an EU average of 27.7%.</P>
      <P>Some important points must be remembered in interpreting this. First, we have a relatively young population compared to most of our EU neighbours. Not alone does this mean our pension costs are lower, but we also have lower costs on health care and caring generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> Second, the measurement of social protection expenditure by Eurostat also includes expenditure on occupational pension and benefit systems. While occupational pensions and benefits play an important role in the overall social protection system in Ireland, information on the significant amount of expenditure involved is not currently available for Ireland. Accordingly the figures provided by Eurostat for social protection expenditure seriously understate the actual level of expenditure involved in this country as compared with other EU member states.</P>
    <P>Third, the figures are based on GDP, but it is recognised that in Ireland GNP, rather than GDP, is the better measure of the income available to society. The figures based on GDP therefore understate the proportion of our income that is spent on social protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998, an interdepartmental working group considered the issues which would arise in the event of the alignment of the tax and calendar years. My Department was represented on this group. The arrangements being introduced for 2001 in relation to matters affecting my Department are those recommended by the group. The Government, in July 2000, confirmed this position when the decision was made to effect the change from 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be some cash flow losses in 2001 and 2002 to the social insurance fund as a result of the alignment of the tax and calendar years. These will be approximately £20 million in 2001 and around £5 million in 2002. These arise as a result of remittance patterns in the last two months of each tax year, reductions in payment levels by <Col N="545" /> annual PAYE-PRSI remitters and in P35 balancing payments as well as the fact that profits on which class S contributors will assessed for 2001 will be 25% below normal levels.</P>
    <P>I will put in place a number of special arrangements so as to ensure that no person is disadvantaged from a social welfare point of view as a result of the alignment of the tax and calendar years. As the Deputy will be aware, 2001 will be a once off short tax year. The social insurance entitlements of all contributors will be protected where 2001 is the relevant tax year for entitlement to benefit. This will be achieved by the addition of 14 contributions or credits, as appropriate, to the records of all persons who had a contribution in 2001. This measure is fair to all contributors and eliminates any possibility of contributors being deprived of benefits that they might otherwise have become entitled to in an unchanged scenario; avoids the necessity for extensive, and expensive, legislative and computer program changes; and will not introduce, once off, confusion in relation to entitlement conditions for customers.</P>
    <P>I have now completed the process of aligning the implementation of increases in weekly rates of social welfare payments with the commencement of the income tax year. Accordingly, the unprecedented levels of increases in these payments announced in the budget will take effect from the first week of April 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have already secured the approval of Government for the continuation of this alignment in 2002. This will mean that increases in weekly payments in that year will be effective from the first week of 2002. This will be a very positive outcome for all social welfare claimants arising from the decision to align the tax and calendar years.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the health boards. An interdepartmental committee is currently reviewing the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations.</P>
      <P>Two health board officers, from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Mid-Western Health Board, were nominated to the working group by the health boards. Both have extensive experience in this area, having worked in the community welfare service for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both SIPTU and IMPACT have indicated that they wish to be represented on the interdepart<Col N="546" /> mental committee that is undertaking the review. As Deputies will be aware, it is not normal practice to have trade union representatives on interdepartmental committees that are preparing policy proposals for consideration by Government. In the circumstances, this request was not granted.</P>
    <P>However, there is no question of unions being excluded from this review. On the contrary, the unions representing community welfare staff, SIPTU and IMPACT, were invited to make a submission to the working group last June. This was received at the end of September. In addition, they have been and will continue to be consulted directly at specially convened meetings by my officials during the review. The most recent such meeting took place on 6 September 2000. The next meeting is scheduled for 21 December 2000 at which SIPTU and IMPACT will meet with the working group and make a presentation of their views.</P>
    <P>The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. It also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion. In this regard the exact nature of the future role of community welfare officers will be examined.</P>
    <P>I expect that the proposals of the interdepartmental committee will be finalised by the end of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 45 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications <Col N="547" /> from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published in April this year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services and noted that there are two main groups affected: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructural problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
    <P>The review notes that while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not obliged to provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles accessible to people with disabilities. These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for public transport.</P>
    <P>The review examined a number of alternatives to the existing system including a voucher system or cash payment to those who qualify for the scheme. It considered that such types of systems, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be complicated and less feasible than the current system. Voucher schemes, by their nature, introduce stigma to a scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, they are administratively not feasible, particularly if issued annually, as the number of vouchers and potential operators would be enormous. Furthermore, vouchers or cashing out would do little to facilitate the provision of public transport services where none exist, nor would it facilitate the provision of accessible public transport. This is evident from the various complaints concerning access to wheelchair taxis in Dublin despite the large numbers in existence, a problem which is significantly exacerbated in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes does recommend that a social transport fund be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles.</P>
    <P>The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy. In this regard, an interdepartmental working group on rural transport has recently been established, chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and including a representative from my Department, to consider how best to address the rural transport deficit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> The group has been charged with the development of a template that can be used by each county development board in carrying out a comprehensive countywide audit of rural passenger transport services to establish the extent to which people in rural Ireland have or do not have access to such services and to establish reasonable rural passenger transport needs. In this regard, a tender has recently issued to consultants for technical assistance in the drawing up of such a template.</P>
    <P>I understand that the audits will serve two main purposes, i.e. form part of the wide ranging audit of services which is being undertaken by each county development board in the context of their preparation of their county strategy for economic, social and cultural development and to assist the Government in developing policy proposals on rural passenger transport.</P>
    <P>With regard to free travel companion passes, these passes have been available since 1990 to certain people who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    <P>The review examined the issue of extending the companion free travel pass scheme to other people with disabilities and noted that CIE has expressed concerns about the operation of the companion pass, in particular that anecdotal evidence would suggest that some pass holders are quite capable of travelling alone. In this regard, the review notes that companion passes should be issued only to people who have definite needs.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the free travel scheme's objective to encourage recipients to remain mobile, the review recommends that a free travel companion pass should be issued to all people in receipt of invalidity pension who are unable to travel alone. This would standardise the qualifying conditions for a companion pass for both invalidity pension and disability allowance.</P>
    <P>The review's proposal in this regard, which has expenditure implications, will be considered in context of future budgets.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to adopting a families first approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies. In 2001, Government investment in the development of family services in my Department will amount to over £16.5 million, compared to £1.5 million in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Following the allocation of significant extra resources in last week's budget, a record £4.81 million is being provided in 2001 for voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services, marriage preparation courses, child counselling services in relation to parental separation and bereavement counselling and support services. Some 400 groups providing these services have already received grant aid amounting to £3.75 million in this current year.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, when I extended the scheme to cover voluntary organisations providing bereavement counselling and support services, an increased number of organisations providing these specialised services have received grant aid each year. This year to date some 380 organisations throughout the country providing child and/or bereavement counselling and support have received grant aid amounting to £1.03 million. Organisations which have received significant grants include: Teen Between, an initiative of Marriage and Relationship Counselling Services Limited, MRCS, and the National Youth Federation, NYF, to provide support and counselling to children whose parents have separated, £23,500 this year; Solas, a specialised bereavement service for children administered by Barnardos, £60,000 this year; Rainbows, which provide a particular type of support for children whose lives have been affected by bereavement or parental separation. The Rainbows National Office has received £110,000 over the past two years to develop their programme. A further 75 Rainbows groups throughout the country received individual grants amounting to £60,000 in total this year.</P>
    <P>Other specialised groups which have benefited include Loved Ones of Sea Tragedies, LOST, and Headway (Ireland) Ltd.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that in addition to the £1 million extra investment provided for the grant scheme in the budget for 2001 special allocations have again been provided for two groups providing specialised bereavement services. Rainbows National Office and Turning Point are to receive £70,000 and £40,000 respectively to further develop their services.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the 2001 scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services will be advertised in January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones. The fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks, as announced in this year's budget. The current fuel season will be extended by two weeks in April 2001 and the next fuel season will start one week earlier in October 2001.</P>
      <P>The standard £5 per week rate of fuel allowance was set at its present level in 1985. However, the fuel allowance payment rate cannot be looked at in isolation from primary payment rates as every person who gets a fuel allowance also gets a weekly primary social welfare payment, such as unemployment assistance or old age pension. It is important that the overall increase, taking primary payments and fuel allowances together, is sufficient to fully compensate for all inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
      <P>Increases in overall weekly social welfare payment rates have compensated fully for inflation, including fuel price inflation, over the period from October 1985 to October 2000. For example, the total weekly payment for a single retirement pensioner with a fuel allowance rose by over 79% while the total weekly payment for an unemployed person rose by over 106%. This does not take into account the increases announced in last week's budget which were the largest ever provided. These will provide a real increase after fully compensating for inflation.</P>
      <P>To put this in perspective, fuel price inflation was 25.3% in total between October 1985 and October 2000, as tracked in the fuel and light component of the consumer price index. The overall consumer price index rose by 52.1% in that period.</P>
      <P>I did not increase the rate of fuel allowance this year because any such increase would be paid for only part of the year. I opted instead for giving people a real increase in their basic social welfare payment for 52 weeks of the year.</P>
      <P>This is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate but I believe it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs.</P>
      <P>Also, it can be very difficult for people on low incomes to adjust to the loss of the fuel allowance in April when the fuel season ends. Those difficulties would be made worse by increasing the fuel allowance instead of giving a larger all-year-round increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, all social welfare primary payments are increased in 2001 by either £8 or £10 <Col N="551" /> per week. The qualified adult allowance will also be increased by amounts ranging from £7 to £15. This means that in 2001, a pensioner couple, where both are over pension age, will get a combined increase of between £20 and £25 per week. Furthermore, these increases will come into effect from April 2001, a month earlier than this year.</P>

      <P>The total income of the social insurance fund in 1999 was £2.49 billion and it is projected that total income in 2000 will be around £2.94 billion. Expenditure from the fund amounted to £2.22 billion in 1999 and expenditure in 2000 is projected to be around £2.60 billion.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the social insurance fund is in a healthy financial situation at the moment. This is due to increased levels of employment, lower levels of unemployment and the buoyant economic climate generally. The surplus is retained in the fund's investment account. This surplus will not continue indefinitely as ageing of the population will greatly increase demands on the fund over the medium to long-term. Clearly, it is important that the fund's surplus should be used to best advantage having regard to emerging demands and the overall interest of its contributors. As announced recently, the Minister for Finance and I are arranging to have an early examination of possible strategies in this regard.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House on 9 November last, I have felt for some time that the current school meals scheme falls a long way short of what is required. A major reform of the scheme is needed and accordingly, I established an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department to review the scheme from first principles.</P>
      <P>The review is being undertaken as part of the series of expenditure reviews which seek to ensure that spending programmes are still relevant and to identify priorities for adjustments in expenditure. In this case, proposals are being developed for a reformed school meals scheme that will meet the needs of today's school-going children in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> The group have engaged in an extensive consultation process as part of the review. All of the issues and difficulties with the current scheme and suggestions for a reformed scheme that have emerged during the consultation process will inform the group's consideration of the future policy direction for the scheme.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the working group's report within the next six months, following which I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government regarding a reformed school meals scheme.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of the report I was pleased to be able to provide interim funding, in September of this year, of £100,000 per annum towards the food costs, for the voluntary and community groups and schools currently providing school meals outside of the existing scheme. This funding has been allocated to nine groups working in this area and will benefit over 2,000 children. I further re-affirmed my commitment to projects in this area by announcing a further allocation of £200,000 in budget 2001.</P>

      <Quest>his plans in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, to increase the earnings disregard for the one parent family payment.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the most effective route out of poverty is through paid employment. The earnings disregard is a major feature of the one-parent family payment and is designed to recognise the additional costs which a lone parent may face in moving into employment and to ensure that the financial implications of making such a move are straightforward and easily understandable.</P>
      <P>Under the means test associated with the one-parent family payment, a recipient is entitled to earn up to £115.38 without affecting his/her payment. Earnings between £115.38 per week and £230.76 per week are assessed at 50 per cent and the rate of one-parent family payment paid is reduced accordingly. Payment ceases when earnings exceed £230.76 per week. However, there are transitional arrangements in place whereby a recipient of the one-parent family payment who exceeds the upper income limit may retain 50 per cent of his/her entitlement for a further 12 months.</P>
      <P>The review of the one-parent family payment, published on 5 September 2000, is the first review of this scheme since it was introduced in January 1997. The review found that about 60 per cent of one-parent family payment recipients have some level of earnings. Of these, approximately 75 per cent have earnings below the £115.38 per week threshold. The level of earnings may indicate a high level of part-time work which often suits parents with young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> The review concluded that the current level of the disregard is adequate at present to support the level and nature of employment, much of which appears to be part-time, being undertaken by lone parents. In the circumstances, I have no plans at present to alter the level of the disregard. However, the situation will be monitored and reviewed as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 53 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Following the agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. Given its multi-dimensional nature, poverty cannot be solely the concern of one Department. Each Department has a responsibility and an obligation to ensure that its policy proposals are poverty proofed.</P>
      <P>To assist in the implementation of poverty proofing, the national anti-poverty strategy unit, based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing and worked examples which were distributed to all Government Departments last year. The unit has also met with the strategy's liaison officers in all Government Departments and discussed poverty proofing with them in order to assist with any difficulties.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the poverty proofing arrangements are currently being reviewed by the National Economic and Social Council. I expect that the outcome of the review will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties that may constrain its effective implementation. Following the review my Department will consider further measures for improving the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed and this has been the case since late 1998. With regard to the budget, spending Departments are responsible for, and obliged to, poverty proof expenditure measures. In relation to my own Department's preparations for the <Col N="554" /> budget, key principles of the national anti-poverty strategy are built into the development of the social welfare budget package from the start and influence the development throughout. Documents outlining the proofing of the social welfare budget package are available to anyone who expresses an interest from budget day, as they were last year. The documents outline the impact of the main proposals including rates increases, increases in family income support and child benefit, the effect of the package on overall income distribution and its effect on various family types. This budget, to an unprecedented extent, will direct the resources of the State at the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities. About half the total investment of £850 million goes to those on the very lowest incomes &ndash; those in the bottom 30% in terms of income. And over 70% goes to people whose incomes are in the lowest half.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for the overall poverty proofing of the budget is a matter for the Minister for Finance, annex C of the budget documentation, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, shows that, in addition to reviewing the impact of the budget tax package using the national anti-poverty strategy guidelines, the income tax package measures were assessed over various income distributions in conjunction in some cases with social welfare measures.</P>

      <P>The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare services. The underlying objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements under a broad range of social insurance, social assistance and other supports and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.</P>
      <P>My Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering each social welfare payment or scheme and these are widely available at local level from my Department, from post offices and from other organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes and improvements to schemes and services are advertised, using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots. Selective use is also made of Freephone services to provide information and advice on the introduction of new <Col N="555" /> schemes or, for example, at budget time. The budget freephone service is currently operating at 1800 400 400.</P>
    <P>Over the past year, my Department has issued over 530,000 customised information newsletters to different groups of customers, including pensioners, lone parents, people with disabilities and carers. This new initiative, which has been widely welcomed as an effective means of informing customers of their full entitlements, will be extended in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Another initiative undertaken by my Department is a website through which the public can access information on the Department's services. Further developments in relation to the website are being undertaken to extend the range of information available and to make the system more &ldquo;user&rdquo; friendly.</P>
    <P>The Department seeks feedback from customers on a systematic basis in relation to the quality of service and in order to tailor the delivery of services, including information services, to meet their needs. Customer panels and customer surveys are among the mechanisms which are used for this purpose. The findings of these surveys are, in the main, very positive and show a high satisfaction rating with the services provided.</P>
    <P>My Department also works closely with all relevant voluntary sector organisations, a number of which receive funding on an annual basis towards the cost of providing welfare rights and information services for their targets groups.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention the work of Comhairle which was established in June 2000 and which comes within the aegis of my Department. It has been formed through a merger of the former National Social Service Board and relevant functions of the former National Rehabilitation Board and provides independent information, advice and other supports to citizens, including people with disabilities. Comhairle has received additional funding each year from my Department to enable it to further develop its services and supports including the development of the integrated citizen's information database which is now in widespread use not only throughout the network of citizens information centres but also by many other organisations involved in the provision of information on social services generally. I am glad to say that Comhairle has received an additional £1 million in last week's budget to enable it to continue with its important work.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, scheme is administered on my behalf by the health boards. Under the SWA scheme, health boards can provide a basic weekly payment to eligible people who have little or no income. An assessment of a person's means and needs is carried out and where there is a shortfall in a person's income a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
      <P>Payments are made where a person has no means to meet their immediate needs pending payment from another source, for example, where they are awaiting determination of an application for a social welfare or health board payment. Any interim payment which is awarded pending the determination or payment of a social welfare or health board payment is fully recoverable from the arrears once the other payment is awarded.</P>
      <P>As part of an ongoing programme of initiatives to improve customer service my Department has been examining measures to expedite the processing of claims for unemployment benefit and assistance in our network of local offices.</P>
      <P>Improvements have been recently introduced, on a pilot basis, in a number of social welfare local office areas in one region in co-operation with the local health board. This approach has led to a significant reduction in recourse to supplementary welfare allowance. It is hoped to extend these measures on a more widespread basis as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Following on from the expenditure review of the one-parent family payment which was published in September 2000, it is intended review the administration of the one-parent family payment which would include interim payments for that scheme.</P>
      <P>Details of overall interim SWA payments made while awaiting a payment from my Department for the years 1995 to 2000 are included in the following tabular statement. The increase in expenditure is the result of the increases in payment rates rather than an increase in the number of payments made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible, and recognises that people who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home may lose out in maintaining their social insurance record.</P>
      <P>For this reason, special arrangements are in place to assist those who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994, periods of time spent out of the workforce, including self employment caring either for children aged up to six years or incapacitated people are ignored or disregarded when calculating a person's pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, extended the homemaker provisions by increasing the age of children being cared for from six to 12 years.</P>
      <P>For any year to be disregarded a homemaker must be out of the workforce for a complete year, 52 weeks, from 6 April 1994. The maximum period which can be disregarded is 20 years.</P>
      <P>Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,998 people are formally registered under the homemaker's scheme, comprising mainly people caring for elderly-sick relatives who do not qualify for carer's allowance. Those caring for children would be certified through child benefit records and do not need to formally register for the scheme. Statistics regarding those currently ineligible for the homemaker's scheme are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August I launched the report on phase one of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This report identified the key issues in relation to qualification conditions. It also sets out suggested guiding principles and outlines a framework for reform. In summary, the main proposals outlined in phase one of the review are a switch be accepted, in principle, from the current yearly average test to a system based on a total contributions approach whereby title to pension would be determined by the total number of contributions paid and credited during a person's working life; a switch be accepted, in principle, from <Col N="558" /> the current system of disregards under the homemaker's scheme to a credits-based approach; further recognition be given to contributions paid prior to 1953; and improvements be made to the old age contributory-retirement pensions reduced rates bands with a view to simplifying and rationalising these.</P>
    <P>In budget 2000 the results of the review were anticipated in relation to the last two recommendations mentioned i.e. further recognition of pre-53 contributions and rationalising of old age contributory-retirement pensions rate bands. Some 38,000 pensioners benefited from the rationalising of the old age contributory pension rates structure with overall increases in weekly personal rates of pension ranging between £7.50 and £12.20. Almost 3,300 new pensions have been awarded as a result of the further recognition now being afforded to pre-53 social insurance contributions with many people on <i>pro rata</i> pensions also having their position improved. My Department is still processing applications for these new pensions.</P>
    <P>The proposed switch towards a system based on total contributions represents a very significant change in approach for overall pensions policy. However, I feel that such a system would be more transparent, simpler and more easily understood by the general public. The current system is based on the average level of contributions made each year over a person's working life and this has given rise to anomalies and problems.</P>
    <P>However, much work needs to be done before such a system could be introduced. In particular, the appropriate level of contributions required for a pension needs to be determined and transitional arrangements will also have to be put in place. These issues will be examined in the second phase of this review.</P>
    <P>The report also examined the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in 1994. Under this scheme periods spent caring for children or disabled relatives can be disregarded when a person's PRSI record is being assessed for old age contributory-retirement pension purposes. The review proposed that, in principle, the disregard approach should be replaced with one based on credited contributions. The operative date of the homemaker's scheme was also examined and it was considered that there is no fundamental reason, in principle, why the homemaker provisions should only apply from 1994; however, there are significant cost and operational issues to be considered. As outlined in my recent speech on the budget, I am strongly committed to implementing these proposals. Phase two of the review, which will get under way in the new year, will consider the most appropriate way of achieving these. When implemented these measures should help many more people to qualify for pensions.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy set out a number of goals to be achieved over a ten year period from 1997 to 2007, including targets in relation to income adequacy. The latest data available, in respect of 1998, show that 6% to 8% of the population are living in consistent poverty, so we are well on our way to achieving our revised target of below 5% by 2004.</P>
      <P>There is no single best way to measure poverty. No one method can provide all the answers. To effectively measure poverty it is necessary to look more broadly at a person's exclusion from the life of society because of lack of resources. Direct measures of deprivation provide a valuable and complementary source of information in measuring poverty and assessing poverty trends.</P>
      <P>The NAPS poverty target defines consistent poverty as being below 50-60% of average household income and experiencing enforced basic deprivation. This, as the Deputy will know, is based on independent research by the Economic and Social Research Institute. Eight basic items were identified by the Economic and Social Research Institute in their 1987 household survey, following their selection by the respondents themselves as basic necessities but which they are unable to afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute, supported by my Department, keeps the deprivation index under regular review to ensure that it remains relevant to people's perception of <Col N="560" /> necessities. The indicators were most recently examined in June 1999 in relation to the 1997 Living in Ireland Survey and an examination in relation to the 1998 Living in Ireland Survey will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Central to a relative conception of poverty is the understanding that expectations and perceptions of needs will change over time as general living standards rise. It is therefore necessary to consider incorporating further items which, through changing attitudes and expectations &ldquo;become necessities&rdquo; over time. Current evidence from the Economic and Social Research Institute suggests that it remains valid to restrict the deprivation index to the original items and that the original set of basic items is more successful in capturing generalised deprivation than an expanded set would be at this point. However, regular review of the deprivation index will continue and changes will be made to the index as necessary, based on evidence from the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>

      <P>I welcome the findings of the second annual report of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy Interdepartmental Policy Committee 1999-2000 which I launched with the Taoiseach on September 29.</P>
      <P>This second National Anti-Poverty Strategy progress report provides an overview of developments in social inclusion and anti-poverty initiatives across all Government Departments over the past year under the five key theme areas: educational disadvantage, unemployment, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty. It also outlines new policy initiatives to combat social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The progress which has been made since the launch of the strategy in 1997 is very significant. The key targets set under the strategy have now all been met. Unemployment is down to 3.7%, long-term unemployment is down from 7% in 1996 to 1.6% today and consistent poverty has almost halved from 15% to just over 8% today.</P>
      <P>While progress to date has been striking much needs to be done. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the methodology underlying the national anti-poverty strategy will be reviewed, existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate and new targets will be considered under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people, and housing-accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of working groups, with social partner representation, are currently being estab<Col N="561" /> lished to facilitate the review of targets. The first meetings of the working groups on housing-accommodation and health were held in October and working groups on employment, education, rural poverty and urban disadvantage are also being established. A separate working group has been established, with an independent chairperson, to examine the issues in relation to benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy Inter-Departmental Policy Committee will continue to play a key role in addressing issues central to the strategy, such as the current review, and agreeing future plans and programmes of activity. I am confident that this work will provide the basis for further progress towards our goal of effectively eradicating poverty.</P>

      <P>Reach is the cross-departmental programme established to integrate delivery of public services to citizens. The programme involves the development of a public services broker that will act as the common gateway to public services and will provide common services such as identity validation, storing and sharing of data and a secure environment for electronic Government services.</P>
      <P>Reach and the public service broker are about providing the best possible service to customers, allowing them to conduct their dealings with the public service in the ways that best suit their needs. This will allow improvements in service through the traditional channels of contacts in local office and over the telephone as well as making services available through the new electronic channels.</P>
      <P>The Reach programme is a major undertaking that will take a number of years to develop fully and that will involve nearly all public service agencies.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has already been made. The Reach agency has conducted an intensive series of workshops and consultations with other Departments and agencies and external experts. The basic model of the public services broker has been validated and developed in greater detail. The high level design of the broker will be published shortly for the guidance of other Departments and agencies, and to initiate the public consultation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next step for Departments in moving forward the Reach agenda will be the preparation this month of their electronic service delivery strategies. A more detailed Reach programme for <Col N="562" /> integrated service delivery will be published following a review of those strategies.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is actively involved in preparations for the development of the broker systems by helping other Departments and agencies to use the personal public services number as the common customer identifier. A publicity campaign &ndash; including the issue of a leaflet and other materials &ndash; has been staged to raise awareness of the number amongst members of the public and other public service agencies. Arrangements concerning the extension of the use of the PPS number have been worked out with several sectors.</P>
    <P>Oasis &ndash; a pilot self-service information system for personal customers &ndash; is now live on the internet for evaluation and feedback purposes. This system is being developed by Comhairle as part of the Reach programme.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is developing a similar system &ndash; called Basis &ndash; catering for the needs of the business customer.</P>
    <P>The other elements of the broker will be developed and implemented on a phased basis in accordance with the Government's overall strategy and timetable which will be announced as soon as the individual Department's and agencies-strategies are finalised and co-ordinated.</P>

      <Quest>the situation with regard to the child dependant allowances; the cost to date in 2000; if he will introduce a standard rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently three different rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients, ranging from £13.20 per week to £17.00 per week. The reasons for this are largely historical. There has been considerable rationalisation of rates over the year, in line with a recommendation made by the Commission on Social Welfare. The number of different rates has been reduced from 36 at the time the Commission reported in 1986, down to the current three.</P>
      <P>Data relating to expenditure on child dependant allowances to date in 2000, is not readily available. However, it is estimated that the cost of child dependant allowances in a full-year presently amounts to £257 million. The introduction of a standard rate would be extremely costly; the full year cost of paying all child dependant allowances at the highest rate currently paid is estimated to be in the region of £49 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients <Col N="563" /> on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. The policy direction followed by successive Governments has, therefore, been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit. Unlike child dependant allowances, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme. Before we came to office, expenditure on child benefit was £397 million annually. Our first three budgets increased this to £575 million &ndash; an increase of more than 40%. The increases I announced in budget 2001 constitute a full-year investment of £330 million in the child benefit scheme. Moreover, this is only the first of three years of increases which will see investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003, that is, almost a three fold increase. By the end of this period, the higher rate of child benefit will be £146 per month, and the lower rate will be £117.50. A family with four children will, in 2003, be receiving £120 per week in child benefit. The relative importance of child dependant allowances will clearly decline in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I believe that investment in the child benefit scheme is the correct approach and represents the most effective use of the resources available for child income support.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one-parent family payment is a means tested payment which is intended to assist a lone parent who is bringing up a child or children without the support of a partner. In order to qualify for the one-parent family payment, an applicant must satisfy a number of statutory conditions. He or she must have the main care and charge of at least one child, must not be cohabiting, must, if earning, have gross earnings of less than £230.76 per week, equivalent to £12,000 per annum, and <Col N="564" /> must satisfy a means test. In addition, in appropriate cases, it is necessary to establish that efforts have been made to obtain maintenance from the former spouse or partner before a payment can be put into effect.</P>
    <P>My Department has as a priority obligation to provide the best possible service to claimants under the various schemes and to process new claims in the fastest possible times. Over the past 12 months, the average number of weeks to decide a claim was 10.1 weeks in the case of claims from unmarried claimants and 12.8 weeks in the case of claims from separated claimants.</P>
    <P>The number of new one-parent family payments claims is currently averaging around 18,000 per annum &ndash; equivalent to about 350 per week. There have been significant improvements in the earnings exemptions for lone parents and, due to the relatively young age-profile of this group, they are more likely to move in and out of employment, education or training on a regular basis. Approximately 52,000 existing cases will have to be reviewed at the clients' instigation this year.</P>
    <P>A number of developments are under way to address this situation. My Department is engaged in a review of its administrative staffing requirements and work priorities in its pension services office &ndash; where the one-parent family payment scheme is administered &ndash; to reflect the growing new claim and workload generally there.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, and following on from the review of the one-parent family payment which was published in September 2000, it is intended to devolve the administration of the one-parent family payment to the Department's network of local offices around the country. This is aimed primarily at making it more accessible to lone parents. It will also be of value in helping lone parents to access information about employment, education and training opportunities in their own area, through my Department's local employment support services. I expect that this devolution of administration will also assist in reducing claim processing times through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network.</P>
    <P>A working group has been set up in my Department to oversee the arrangements that must be put in place to effect the transfer of OFP claims processing to the Department's network of local offices. As a first step, it is proposed to initiate a pilot project for processing new claims in the Dublin west area early in the new year. This pilot will help to identify any issues or problems arising form localisation and allow for these to be addressed before extending localisation to other local offices.</P>
    <P>A large majority of one-parent family payment applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. The main form of such support is supplementary welfare allowance or unemployment assistance while some would be in receipt of maternity benefit, unemployment benefit or disability benefit. This does not, of course, obviate the need to provide <Col N="565" /> an efficient, and speedy claim processing service to one-parent family payment applicants. I believe that the measures now being planned will bring about a measurable improvement in the quality and timeliness of service to one-parent family payment applicants in the future.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on rent supplements up to 1 December 2000 was approximately £109.3 million. It is estimated that expenditure for the whole of 2000 will be in the region of £118.4 million.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, all applicants, including pensioners, are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget, I have eased the means test for pensioners aged 66 years and over who are dependent on rent or mortgage interest supplement. From April 2001 the first £5 of budget increases will not affect the amount of rent or mortgage supplement payable to these people. This improvement will also apply to invalidity and retirement pensioners who are over 65 years.</P>
      <P>Another improvement announced in the budget was an increase of £10 in the maximum rate of rent supplement for tenants under the capital assistance scheme. The maximum rate for a single person has increased from £19 to £29 per week for single people and from £21 to £31 for others. These changes will come into effect in April 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities and will help to ensure that the best possible <Col N="566" /> housing options are made available to people with long-term housing needs who currently rely on supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement.</P>
    <P>The Department of Environment and Local Government are currently setting up pilot schemes in nine local authorities to provide rental accommodation in the private sector for people who would otherwise rely on SWA rent supplement. Under this proposal the local authorities will lease suitable property from property owners and offer tenancies in those properties to people on their housing lists who are also on SWA rent supplement. The tenant will pay rent to the local authority on the same basis as other council tenants.</P>
    <P>In addition, a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is currently under way. All aspects of the scheme will be examined, including the arrangements governing payment of rent supplements to people on social welfare incomes. The report is due at the end of next year. I believe that these initiatives will lead to substantial improvements for people on social welfare incomes who are renting in the private sector.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme falls within the income maintenance framework which provides a safety net against poverty in that it gives a statutory entitlement to a minimum weekly payment, based on criteria set out in legislation. It also provides for the payment of supplements such as the rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, e.g, single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc., as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accom<Col N="567" /> modation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
    <P>The limits in all health board areas take into account information received from local auctioneers and letting agents regarding average rents charged in the area. These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>Health boards must also satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within the limits which they set. If any tenant is experiencing difficulties, the health boards have discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee is currently reviewing the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme which will include all aspects of the administration of SWA including rent supplement.</P>
    <P>I expect that the proposals of the interdepartmental committee will be finalised by the end of next year. All recommendations of this review will be formally poverty proofed to reflect the contribution SWA makes to reducing poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits are set out in section 205 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as amended, and in regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a claim is made late, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office in 1997, I have made a number of improvements to the provisions relating to late social welfare claims. For instance, prior to 1997 arrears of contributory pension claims were limited to either three months or six months before the date of claim. However, under new provisions that came into operation in February 1998, the period for which such arrears can be paid in full was extended to twelve months and, where a claim under these schemes is more than 12 months late, the period of payment is extended on a proportional basis.</P>
      <P>The legislation also provides for payment to be made on foot of late claims in the case of a range of other schemes for a period of six months prior to the date of claim provided there was good cause for the late claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation now also provides for relaxation of the restrictions on backdating late claims under all schemes apart from unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, and for further payment to be <Col N="569" /> made, up to the level of full retrospection where the circumstances would warrant it, where the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department, or illness or a <i>force majeure</i> prevented a person from claiming earlier or, the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</P>
    <P>Regulations made by me earlier this year put on a statutory basis certain extra-statutory provisions that had applied in the case of late claims under certain schemes. All late claims are now determined in accordance with the legislation.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to late claims have been subjected to very close scrutiny in recent years. There is a general obligation on people to claim their social welfare entitlements in time. However, cases will inevitably arise where they fail to do so and the legislative provisions are designed to cater for such situations. I am satisfied that the current provisions strike a reasonable balance between, on the one hand the need to exercise supervision and control of claims and the requirements of sound financial management and control of public expenditure and, on the other hand, the need for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the award of social insurance credited contributions to adults who are engaged in full-time training and education is as follows. Persons who undertake training courses provided by or approved by FÁS, CERT, TEAGASC or Bord Iascaigh Mhara are insurable at PRSI class J and are covered for occupational injuries benefits. However, participants are awarded a class A social insurance credit in respect of the periods spent on these courses provided that the last paid contribution was not a voluntary contribution or at a modified rate. In the latter case, the credited contribution awarded will be confined to those benefits for which that last paid contribution is reckonable.</P>
      <P>Students aged up to 23, who take up insurable employment on finishing full-time education, are awarded student credits which are reckonable for short-term benefits, such as unemployment, disability or maternity benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, participants on the back to education scheme, the vocational training opportunities scheme or any other approved course which qualifies for the retention of unemployment payments, who fulfil the above-mentioned criteria for the award of credited contributions, <Col N="570" /> are awarded a class A social insurance credit in respect of periods spent on these courses.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to ensuring the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible, and recognises that people who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home may lose out in maintaining their social insurance record.</P>
    <P>For this reason, special arrangements are in place to assist those who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994, periods of time spent out of the workforce, including self employment caring either for children aged up to six years or incapacitated people are ignored or disregarded when calculating a person's pension entitlements. The Social Welfare Act, 1996, extended the homemaker provisions by increasing the age of children being cared for from six to 12 years.</P>
    <P>For any year to be disregarded a homemaker must be out of the workforce for a complete year, 52 weeks, from 6 April 1994. The maximum period which can be disregarded is 20 years.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted.</P>
    <P>I am strongly committed to converting the existing system of homemaker disregards, which help women who take time out from the paid workforce, into homemaker credits. This issue along with possible backdating of the arrangements, will be considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualification conditions for pensions which my Department will undertake in the new year. When implemented this measure should help many more people who take time out of the workforce for family reasons to qualify for pensions.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is <Col N="572" /> to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations that have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997, I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million was again provided for the scheme in 2000.</P>
      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was reviewed by external consultants in recent years and there are no plans to change the operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above mentioned programme, my Department operates a number of community development support programmes, namely; community development programme; family and community services resource centre programme; programme of core-funding to locally based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>The focus of these programmes are on disadvantaged groups regardless of the source of disadvantage rather than on particular groups such as the elderly or those with disability. The programmes provide seed money to enable self-help groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs. To be eligible for funding, groups must subscribe to a self-help, community development ethos and must involve intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project. The programmes of support were devised to develop marginalised and disadvantaged people and their capacity to participate in society, rather than for the provision of services. Voluntary organisations and groups seeking inclusion in any of the above mentioned programmes of support are required to have an anti-poverty focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and exclusion.</P>
      <P>As is usual in my Department, information on groups funded under these programmes will be made available to the Dáil library early in 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department has ongoing plans to improve the level of support to projects funded under its schemes of support for community development. These supports include training, management advice and assistance with practical and developmental issues.</P>

      <P>To date I have not had any formal contact with my Finnish counterpart on the specific issue of guaranteed basic income. However, following the Lisbon Summit, a process of open co-ordination has been established to enable the community support and complement the activities of the member states in relation to the combating of social exclusion, and the modernisation and improvement of social protection.

      <P>The programme of action over the coming years will include a national two year action plan for combating poverty and social exclusion by 2001; initiatives to ensure a follow up to the 1992 EU  recommendation on minimum guaranteed resources; and analysis of social protection adjustments and progress made in order to make work pay, promote secure incomes and reconcile work and family life.</P>
      <P>This process will enable all member states shortly to obtain a detailed analysis and evaluation of the various policies being implemented throughout the EU, including a guaranteed basic income, to meet common challenges in the area of social protection.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual at any one time. This is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual.</P>
      <P>However, an exception to this rule is made in the case of widows, widowers and other lone parents who are sick or unemployed. Where a person who is in receipt of a widow or widower's pension or one-parent family payment satisfies the relevant contribution conditions, they may be entitled to receive disability benefit or unemployment benefit at half-rate for a period of up to 15 months, in addition to their pension. Furthermore, if they are entitled to a widow or widower's pension or one-parent family payment at a reduced rate, for example, on the basis of insufficient PRSI contributions or on means grounds, the rate of that payment is increased to the maximum level for the duration of their claim for disability or unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> These provisions discriminate positively in favour of widowed people and other lone parents. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the current arrangements for payment of disability or unemployment benefit in addition to widow or widower's pension are reasonable.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to full compliance with the provisions of the Equal Status Act, 2000. The Act, which came into effect on 25 October 2000, prohibits discrimination, <i>inter alia,</i> in the provision of goods, services and facilities, on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, race, age, sexual orientation, disability, religious belief, membership of the traveller community.</P>
      <P>The legislation has implications for quality customer service and my Department is responding accordingly.</P>
      <P>One of the key components of the programme for the modernisation of the public service is the development of excellent customer service. In this regard principles of quality customer service were endorsed by Government in May 1997. These principles formed the basis of my Department's customer action plan which was published in November 1997.</P>
      <P>The quality customer service principles have been revised to include three new principles including equality and diversity.</P>
      <P>The revised principles were endorsed by Government in July this year. Officials from my Department were involved in the preparation of the revised principles. A copy of the revised principles has been circulated to all staff in my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department's customer action plan is now being revised and the equality and diversity principle will form an important element of the revised plan which is due for publication at the end of March 2001. The provisions of the Equal Status Act, 2000, will be taken into account in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, my Department has developed a comprehensive range of training and awareness raising programmes and initiatives to support its staff who deal with the public. The customer service training programme which includes modules on disability awareness and the importance of an anti-discriminatory approach. The content of the programme was informed by research into best practice in these areas and external specialist trainers were engaged to assist in the delivery of the programme. The programme has been delivered to approximately 1,500 staff in my Department's <Col N="575" /> local offices and is currently being delivered to staff in our headquarter offices. The programme has been recognised as an example of good practice by the equality authority.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining how to build on existing initiatives in order to further enhance the support that staff require to carry out their duties in an objective and sensitive way.

      <P>There were a total of 13,065 families in receipt of family income supplement, as of end November 2000. Details of the numbers who benefited from FIS in each of the years between 1996 and 1999 are set out in the attached tabular statement.</P>
      <P>Regarding poverty traps, I assume the Deputy is referring to the potential for a fall in income when entitlement to FIS is fully exhausted and the level of tax payable increases.</P>
      <P>I would wish of course that no situation would arise where this could occur. The reality is that such traps can feature in any system which is based on income thresholds. The range of measures taken by this Government, particularly the improvements in the tax regime and the assessment of FIS on the basis of net rather than gross income &ndash; have had the effect of greatly reducing the incidence and extent of the poverty traps and ensured that they can only arise significantly further up the income distribution than was the case previously.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the 2001 budget provides for increases of the FIS weekly income thresholds by £25 at each point. This will add an additional £15 to the payments of nearly all existing FIS recipients. These increases will have the effect of further alleviating any remaining poverty traps which occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the desirability of ensuring that there is always a positive return from increases in wages, I will continue to explore the potential for further easing any remaining poverty traps. In general, however, the FIS scheme is very effective in ensuring that workers with families and on the lowest incomes have a real incen<Col N="576" /> tive to take up and remain in low-paid employment and to improve wages.</P>

      <P>Out of Sight &ndash; The Hidden Poverty of Women, published recently by the National Women's Council, is a welcome initiative to ensure that the full extent of women's poverty can be identified and addressed.</P>
      <P>Women are at a significant risk of poverty and some predominately female groups, such as lone parents, are at a very high poverty risk. The Government is strongly committed to eliminating poverty for all our people, including women and </P>
      <P>children. One of the main principles underlying the national anti-poverty strategy is &ldquo;the reduction of inequalities and in particular, addressing the gender dimensions of poverty&rdquo;. Women's poverty has been identified as a central issue for consideration in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As part of the review, existing national anti-poverty strategy targets will be revised as appropriate and consideration will be given to possible new targets under the themes of women's poverty, child poverty, older people, health, and housing-accommodation. Working groups are currently being established, with representation from the social partners, towards this end.</P>
      <P>This Government is taking a number of practical steps to address key issues of relevance to women. Earlier this year I launched a report on women's access to labour market opportunities. I recently launched a review of our one parent family payment which sets out a range of measures to improve parent's income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2001 budget will, to an unprecedented extent, direct the resources of the State at the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities. The changes that I announced last week are focused on people in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty. As well as the young and the elderly, women in general and those dependent on social welfare will all greatly benefit from the provisions in this budget. Measures such as child benefit increases of £25 per month for the first and second child and £30 per month for third and subsequent children; an increase in family income support by £15; extension of the duration of maternity and adoptive benefit; a £10 weekly <Col N="577" /> increase for pensioners aged 66 or over and for people on retirement or invalidity pension aged 65 or over, the extension of free schemes to all people aged 70 or over, and an increase in the rate of qualified adult allowance; the qualified adult allowance for qualified adults over the age of 66 will be increased further over future budgets to the full old age pension rate and arrangements will be put in place so that part of the pension can be paid directly to the qualified adult as a homemakers pension; and increases in rates for carers and changes in the means test for the carers allowance which mean that 5,000 extra people qualify will improve the financial position of many women and will enhance the possibility for women of all ages to achieve economic independence.</P>

This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have under<Col N="578" /> taken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The dependant's portion of an unemployment payment may be paid to the spouse or partner of the claimant as a separate payment where it is likely that the amount of benefit or assistance payable will not be used for the subsistence of the family unit. The spouse may apply at his or her social welfare local office for a separate payment to be made.</P>
      <P>My Department's Guide to Social Welfare Services, SW4, and the relevant guidelines published under freedom of information legislation provide information in relation to the circumstances in which separate payments may be claimed and the calculation of payments. Customers are advised that, if they wish to apply for separate payments, they should write or call to their nearest social welfare local office.</P>
      <P>Spouses or partners who are in receipt of a separate payment in this way are not included on the live register as they are not in receipt of a payment in their own right.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of any case where difficulty has been experienced in claiming a separate payment, I will have it followed up on receipt of details.</P>
      <P>Where a spouse or partner requests payment of the dependant's portion of an unemployment payment, he or she is also advised of the option of making a claim in his or her own right as this may be more advantageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, one-parent family payment may be claimed if the person is living separately to the <Col N="579" /> claimant, or unemployment benefit or assistance if the statutory conditions are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group has been established to examine the range of issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. This will include their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns. It is envisaged that the working group will also take account of work being carried out to review the underlying methodology of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
      <P>A chairperson for the group has been appointed, social partners and relevant Departments have nominated representatives, and the group met for the first time this morning.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the PPF, there are complex issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy cites wages and salaries as a possible index, this is just one of a number of options that may be available for consideration by the group. It would, however, be inappropriate to pre-empt discussions of the working group at this point.</P>

      <P>This Government took up office in mid-1997 at a time when the live register stood at 254,863. Since then the figures have dropped consistently to the current low figure of 136,962 at end November 2000. This decrease of 117,901, a drop of 46%, is a reflection of the success of the programme implemented by this Government since taking up office.</P>
      <P>According to the latest figures available from the Central Statistics Office, there was a decrease of 2,227 &ndash; from 139,189 to 136,962 &ndash; in the live register in November 2000. This decrease consisted of 519 unemployment benefit, 1,626 unemployment assistance, and 82 other registrants &ndash; those who sign for credited contributions only. The overall decrease in the numbers on unemployment benefit comprise an increase of 143 in the number of male claimants over 25 offset by decreases amounting to 662 in other categories.</P>
      <P>Increases were recorded in the mid-west, north east, the south west and south east, and in the western areas, which are consistent with reported temporary layoffs in the meat industry, seasonal layoffs in agriculture and related industries, in the tourist industry, and layoffs in the fishing industry due to adverse weather conditions.</P>

      <P>The latest figures available for average industrial earnings relate to March 2000 and show that average earnings per week were £330.18. If a minimum social welfare payment was pitched at 34% and 40% of this figure, it would amount to £112.26 and £132.07 respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years considerable flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) pension scheme. Some of the more significant improvements in recent years include the introduction of pro-rata pensions for people with mixed insurance records, the reduction in the number of contributions required for the old age (contributory) pension to a yearly average of ten and the introduction of a special old age (contributory) pension for self-employed people in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, this year's Social Welfare Act provided for further recognition of contributions paid prior to 1953 through the introduction of a <Col N="582" /> new flat-rate, 50%, pension for people who had previously failed to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension due to the yearly average test or who qualified for a pension payment at a lower rate. All of these measures are making it easier for people to qualify for pension, particularly those who, for one reason or another, have broken insurance records. Specific issues in relation to the operation of the marriage bar in the public service are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>At present, it is estimated that about 90% of women over 65 years of age are receiving a social welfare pension. Of these 87% have a payment in their own right with about 62% of those who have a payment receiving one based on their PRSI record. While it would be impossible for the social welfare system to cover all gaps in pension coverage, nevertheless, more can be done in this area to improve on the numbers receiving PRSI based pensions. In this regard, I am strongly committed to converting the existing system of homemaker disregards, which help women who take time out from the paid workforce, into homemaker credits. I also believe that, in principle, the homemaker's scheme, which currently operates only from 1994, should be backdated; however, there are significant cost and administrative issues to be considered in this regard. These issues will be considered in the context of the second phase of the review of the qualification conditions for pensions which my Department will undertake in the new year. When implemented this measure should help many more women to qualify for pensions.</P>
    <P>In last week's budget, I announced that the rate of the qualified adult allowance for those over the age of 66 would be increased over this and future budgets to the full old age pension rate. As the first step in achieving this, the rate of the qualified adult allowance paid with pensions for persons over 66 years will be increased by £15 per week with effect from the first week in April 2001.</P>
    <P>Following on the report of the PPF working group which is currently examining the issues of administrative individualisation, it will be possible in future to pay part of the pension directly to the qualified adult. The issues associated with the implementation of this arrangement are being examined by the working group. This measure, when combined with the proposed increase in the qualified adult allowance will benefit many women who cannot qualify for a payment in their own right.</P>

      <P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits <Col N="583" /> are set out in section 205 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as amended, and in regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a claim is made late, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements, where a claim to old age contributory or retirement pension, widow's or widower's contributory pension or orphan's contributory allowance is made late, arrears of up to 12 months is paid. This applies to any claims made on or after 1 January 1997. Under regulations which I made in 1998 additional arrears beyond 12 months is paid on a sliding scale.</P>
      <P>For pension claims made prior to 1 January 1997, arrears of up to six months can be paid. In addition, I obtained Government approval for once-off payments to contributory pensioners who made late claims prior to 1997. Arrears totalling £9.4 million have been paid to 5,700 such pensioners.</P>
      <P>Regardless of when late pension claims are made there is provision to pay further arrears, up to the level of full retrospection where the circumstances would warrant it, where the delay in claiming was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department; illness or <i>force majeure</i> prevented a person from claiming earlier; or, the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve current financial hardship.</P>
      <P>The payment of full arrears to widows and all late pension claimants would give rise to a once-off cost, estimated at £54 million. In addition, there would be an ongoing annual cost of £3 million.</P>
      <P>It is a long-standing requirement of our legislation that claims should be made within a certain time. Similar provisions are a feature of the legislation of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> The changes which have been made in recent years represent a significant improvement in the position that has applied heretofore and, in my view, strike a reasonable balance between the need for effective management of the system and for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty. Pensioners with late claims now receive full arrears for a certain period of their claim plus a proportion of arrears over the remaining period of the late claim. Full arrears for the entire period of the claim may be made in certain circumstances. All late claims are determined in accordance with legislation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the arrangement which I have made since coming into office in relation to the late claims issue represent a reasonable and fair response to this problem.</P>

      <P>There is, at this stage, quite a considerable body of largely EU-led legislation directed at protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers. Responsibility for this legislation is spread over a number of Departments, having regard to their respective policy remits.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 92 of 2000). These regulations give effect to EU labelling rules of a general nature that apply to all foodstuffs. A codified text of the relevant EU rules is contained in European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/13/EC of 13 March 2000.</P>
      <P>The regulations apply to all foodstuffs placed for sale on the Irish market, with the exception of foodstuffs pre-packaged on a retail premises for direct sale to a consumer to which many of the provisions do not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations require certain specific information to be provided on the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs, including the name of the product, the name or business name and address of the manufacturer, packer or seller of the product established within the EU, the list of ingredients, the net quantity and the best before or best <Col N="590" /> before end date, as appropriate. Products that are microbiologically perishable require a use by date. The rules are designed to inform and protect consumers by ensuring that they have the information necessary to make informed choices about the products that they purchase. It is an offence to sell, present, or advertise foodstuffs that do not contain this information. Prosecutions under the regulations may be taken by the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Eastern Regional Health Authority or a health board in whose functional area the offence was committed.</P>
    <P>The question of legislation targeted at the sale of products consumed by children would come within the remit of my Department. Under general food safety legislation which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, I am informed that it is an offence to sell, offer or keep for sale food which is unfit for human consumption.</P>

      <P>I understand that the company are in the process of appointing a liquidator and it will be for the liquidator to deal with the question of severance pay. In the event of an employee not receiving their statutory lump sum, my Department will ensure payment of the correct statutory sum to that employee from the social insurance fund.</P>

      <P>The Dunmanway Inter Agency Task Force was established following the announcement that Molnlycke was to close with effect from 11 February 2000 with the loss of 113 jobs. The task force is chaired by IDA Ireland and comprises representatives from Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, the County Enterprise Board and the county manager for west Cork. The main focus for the task force is on attracting a replacement industry and providing assistance to employees such as advice on alternative career opportunities and training-retraining courses.</P>
      <P>In February 2000, FÁS staff attended the Molnlycke plant to register 103 employees who indicated an interest in FÁS courses or employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>On 21-22 March 2000, FÁS attended Dunmanway to register participants for a return to work-ECDL course &ndash; this course took place from 10 April to 14 July, with 24 participants. On completion of the course, 11 participants were placed in employment. Others expressed an interest in further training. However, there has been a poor response to the FÁS follow-up survey from these participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 4-5 September 2000, FÁS attended Dunmanway to register participants for a second <Col N="592" /> return to work-ECDL Course, which commenced on 25 October and is due to finish in January 2001 with 22 participants &ndash; FÁS was unable to fill this course. Two of these participants are from the Molnlycke plant.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of site visits to the plant by companies but no definite interest has been expressed in the facility.</P>
    <P>On 31 August 2000 the Molnlycke factory was purchased by O'Flynn Construction. This Company has developed major office parks such as the University Technology Park in Cork and the Eastgate Business Park at Little Island. As part of a new marketing programme to attract a tenant to the building, IDA Ireland has collaborated with O'Flynn Construction to produce a colour brochure to advertise the factory. In addition, O'Flynn Construction has taken out a half page advertisement in the national newspapers to promote the factory. IDA has supplied lists of companies which they consider may be interested in the factory, including contacts in IDA overseas offices worldwide and contacts within IDA's operating divisions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Both IDA Ireland and FÁS maintain on-going contact with the Dunmanway employment initiative. IDA Ireland continues to promote Dunmanway for potential overseas investment.</P>

    <P>I am anxious to ensure that, as happened in Cork with the Kinsale gas field, the availability of gas in the western region is used to promote the location of industry in that part of Ireland. My priority is to see the extension of the gas network and a new supply off the west coast used to accelerate economic development in the Border, midland and western region. The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary pipeline infrastructure is in place to bring gas to customers, both domestic and commercial in the west. The availability of such a supply will facilitate opportunities for the generation of electricity in the region. I am actively pursuing options in this regard with my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, with a view to ensuring that the availability of Corrib gas assists in bringing <Col N="593" /> high quality electricity generation to the western region.</P>

      <P>Torture is a particularly serious violation of human rights and, as such is strictly condemned by international law. In cooperation with our EU partners and other concerned states, the Government continually monitors human rights abuses in many countries throughout the world. As members of the EU and the Council of Europe, we have been involved in several practical and important initiatives aimed at eradicating the scourge of torture, including our membership of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which has proved itself to be an efficient and practical monitoring system.</P>
      <P>Recently, Ireland along with our EU partners, cosponsored Denmark's resolution entitled &ldquo;Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment&rdquo; at both the UN Commission on Human Rights and at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. This resolution called upon the international community to establish a global monitoring mechanism similar to that established under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the proposal from Amnesty International that the EU should adopt a comprehensive policy on the eradication of torture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An EU human rights working group of which Ireland is a member is already developing a position on EU guidelines on torture. The purpose of <Col N="595" /> any proposed guidelines would be to continue the efforts to make the human rights dimension of the EU's foreign policy more operational. Any guidelines on torture would be used to provide means and methods for achieving the human rights objectives of the EU's foreign policy. While addressing specific concerns about torture would of course be the primary purpose, the guidelines would also contribute to raising the EU's human rights profile in general.</P>

      <P>A survey to establish the level of salmonella in the Irish pig herd was completed in 1996. The tests were carried out on samples from the gastro intestinal tract, caecal swabs, and on extracts from the gall bladder. The results of this survey showed that salmonella was isolated from between 12.0% and 13.2% of the samples taken in seven slaughter plants involved in the survey. A total of 1282 samples were taken in the survey from 225 pig herds. Further tests were carried out for salmonella typhimurium (St). These showed a 4.5% prevalence of salmonella typhimurium in gall bladder samples and 7.2% in caecal swabs. Phage Type DT 104 was found in three of the isolates. A later survey carried out in conjunction with the industry broadly confirmed these findings. Since July 1997, a salmonella control programme has been in place in pig slaughter plants for which my Department has regulatory responsibility. This programme is a comprehensive one which covers herd management and hygiene at all stages of production from the farm to slaughter and processing stage.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also operated a salmonella monitoring programme in poultry breeding flocks, table egg layers and poultry meat carcases since 1988. A slaughter policy is operated in cases of breeding flocks infected with salmonella typhirimium (St) or salmonella enteriditis (S.e). Ireland has been largely free of St and Se at breeding stock level since 1989.</P>
      <P>The existing pig programme is operated on the basis of a voluntary code agreed between producers, processors and the Department. Arrangements are being finalised to put the programme on a statutory basis and to extend it to all plants including those which are not controlled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

      <P>Under EU residues legislation, third countries wishing to export animal products to the EU must satisfy the European Commission that their legislative frameworks and control regimes offer equivalent guarantees to those in place in the EU. In particular, third countries must furnish to the commission on an annual basis detailed residue monitoring plans, together with results of testing under such programmes. The commission also carries out inspection missions in third countries to verify <Col N="600" /> implementation of control measures. Where the commission is not satisfied with the regime in place in a third country, its authorisation to export to the EU may be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Under an exercise conducted in 1999, 164 samples of poultrymeat imported from third countries into Ireland were tested for the presence of antibiotics. While under the 1999 salmonella programme, a total of 2726 samples were taken from poultrymeat of which 430 samples were taken from imported poultry meat in free circulation in the State.</P>
      <P>Product which originates in the EU is subject to common standards and controls applicable across the community and under single market rules routine testing of such product is not provided for.</P>

      <P>The provision of statistical information on the importation of pigmeat from other member states is a function of the Central Statistics Office and I have arranged to have the request referred to the CSO for direct reply.</P>
      <P>Information on the marketing of imported pigmeat under Irish brand names is not readily available. However, based on EU harmonised rules governing veterinary and zootechnical checks, products imported from other member states must be marked with a health mark in accordance with the requirements of Chapter VI of annex B to Council Directive No. 77/99/EEC, as amended. The health mark contains the initials of the exporting member state and the approval number of the consigning establishment within an oval surround. Where the imported product is processed in the State the processed product must then bear on the health mark the approval number of the processing establishment in Ireland and the initials &lsquo;IRL'.</P>

      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the trailer in question was abandoned in a most dangerous manner, without regard for human or animal health, having been used to transport a BSE positive carcase which was illegally dug up in County Galway. The trailer and the carcase involved are at present being held in a secure location until a more permanent solution to the disposal of the carcase is decided upon. For security and safety reasons I do not consider it appropriate to publish the specific location of the trailer at this time.

    <P>The Iranian market for Irish beef was re-opened in late 1998 following difficult and protracted negotiations with the Iranian authorities. Difficulties relating to specific conditions of supply were resolved earlier this year. While the current requirements are for 24 month old animals, discussions have taken place with the Iranian authorities about increasing this to 36 months. Notwithstanding this, the market is currently open and Irish exporters are free to offer beef there. <Col N="607" /> Offers have been made to supply under public tenders in recent months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no EU scheme permitting exemption from VAT for labour intensive industries. Council Directive 99/85/EC authorises member states to apply a reduced rate of VAT as low as 5%, for a maximum period of three years between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2002 to a very restricted number of services such as repairing bicycles, shoes and leather goods, clothing and household linen, including mending and alteration, renovation and repairing of private dwellings excluding materials which form a significant part of the value of the supply, window cleaning and cleaning in private households, domestic care services, e.g. home help and care of the young, elderly, sick or disabled, hairdressing.</P>
      <P>The services concerned must be labour intensive, largely provided direct to consumers, mainly local and not likely to create distortions of competition and there must be a close link between the lower prices resulting from the rate reduction and the foreseeable increase in demand and employment.</P>
      <P>Ireland was fully supportive of this directive but decided not to participate as most of our labour intensive services are subject to the reduced VAT rate of 12.5%. However, the Government is committed to retaining a low rate for labour intensive services and we will be closely examining any proposals in this respect which may emerge in 2003.</P>
      <P>Member states who wanted to participate were required to inform the Commission before 1 November 1999. It is therefore no longer possible to participate in the scheme at this stage. It is intended that before 31 December 2002 that the Commission shall forward a global evaluation report to the Council and Parliament accompanied if necessary by a proposal for appropriate measures for a final decision on the VAT rate applicable to labour intensive services.</P>
      <P>It is not clear as to how the provisions of this directive could be applied to the carpet industry. The sale of carpets to non taxable persons is usually standard rated at 21%. However, if a carpet is supplied and fitted by a contractor, it is subject to the 12.5% rate if the cost excluding VAT to the contractor in carrying out the work exceeds 2/3 of the total cost to the contractor, exclusive of VAT. A carpet manufacturer which supplies over £40,000 of goods in any one calendar year is required to register for VAT and is able to reclaim their inputs.</P>

      <P>In the budget 2001, I announced that probate tax is being abolished in respect of deaths occurring on or after budget day &ndash; 6 December 2000.</P>
      <P>In the case of estates where the death occurred before 6 December 2000 and where the probate tax has been paid or has not yet been paid &ndash; the following rules apply; The tax is charged at a rate of 2% on the net value of non-exempt assets left by a deceased whether the assets passed under will or intestacy. Estates with a taxable value of £40,000 or less are exempt from the tax.</P>
      <P>In relation to a house being left to a family member &ndash; there is an exemption in such cases where the beneficiary is a dependent child or dependent relative of the deceased. The house is exempt from probate tax provided the dependent child or relative had been residing in the dwelling house at the death of the deceased and had an income not exceeding the &ldquo;specified amount&rdquo; applicable in the tax year prior to the date of death, for the tax year 1999/2000, the specified amount is £5,152. To qualify as a dependent child, the child must have been under the age of 18 years, or if over 18 years, in full time education. To qualify as a dependent relative, the person concerned must have been a relative of the deceased or of the wife or husband of the deceased, who was incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or the widowed father or mother, whether or not he or she was so incapacitated, of the deceased or of the wife or husband of the deceased. The dwelling house relief under capital acquisitions tax is a separate issue as the two taxes are different.</P>

This consideration will explore the opportunities for funding the project under either of the two new EU supported programmes for cross-border co-operation, namely the Interreg III programme and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation 2000-2004. I understand that the authorities in Northern Ireland have not been approached with a similar request for funding.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have been active in my support of the scouting associations in recent years. In 1999, I approved a capital grant of £400,000 to Scouting Ireland towards the cost of their new national headquarters. Further State support is provided annually under the youth service grant scheme administered by the Department of Education and Science. This scheme provides funding for the support of voluntary youth work by meeting the costs of administration and staffing. Between 1999 and 2000, some £1,233,741 was paid to Scouting Ireland in support of their youth programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy may be referring to the Council for Children's Hospital Care which was established in 1999. The council's primary role is to assist the three paediatric hospitals, the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght, to work with each other and in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, to plan and develop acute paediatric services on a co-ordinated basis in the functional area of the authority. While the council has an important role regarding the development and other aspects of paediatric services it is not, <i>per se,</i> my advisory body in this regard.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is a statutory body set up under the Health Act 1970 and its main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts and to specify qualifications for such appointments. It also has a function to advise me on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services as appropriate. Comhairle published a report in December 1998 on paediatric surgery services which included paediatric urology services. This report made a number of recommendations which were subsequently considered by the hospitals concerned.</P>
      <P>The council has identified a number of priority areas which it wishes to address including, in particular, the area of paediatric specialist surgery. It has, in recent months, produced a report entitled Paediatric Specialist Surgery: An Outline of the Position and Options.</P>
      <P>My Department and the ERHA support the council's view that the area of specialist paediatric surgery merits immediate attention and recognises Comhairle na nOspideal's statutory role in this regard. Discussions between all parties, that is, Comhairle, the council, the ERHA and my Department have taken place and the respective roles and expectations have been clarified. It is now generally agreed that there is a need for the preparation of a strategic plan for the development, organisation and delivery of acute paediatric services, including paediatric specialist surgery services.</P>
      <P>I have signalled that a national review of all acute paediatric services will be a priority for my Department in 2001.</P>

      <P>I will keep the question of introducing screening programmes for other forms of cancer under review, having regard to the most up to date advice on the medical effectiveness of the available screening techniques. The National Cancer Forum, which advises me on all aspects of cancer services, will continue to have an important role in this regard and I will be asking the forum to ensure that all relevant research is taken into account in arriving at a conclusion on the introduction of new screening programmes and techniques.</P>

      <P>One of these measures is that referred to by the Deputy i.e. the permanent deferral of donors who themselves have had a blood transfusion. Such donors are deferred at present for a period of twelve months after a transfusion. The IBTS will liaise with the CJD advisory group in relation to any proposals relevant to vCJD which it proposes to implement.</P>
      <P>The measures under consideration could have major implications for the current activities of the IBTS. I have assured the board that I will ensure that it is adequately resourced to introduce new measures which are considered necessary to further improve blood safety.</P>

      <P>My Department has been aware of the need to monitor and evaluate overall MRI requirements in the public hospital service, particularly in light of increasing national demand for access to the country's only public MRI scanner at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. Accordingly, an expert study of the existing arrangements for the provision of MRI facilities nationwide and likely future demand in this area was commissioned from Professor David Banta, an international expert in health technology assessment. Professor Banta <Col N="615" /> identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital, Dublin and the new Tallaght Hospital. In May of this year, I sanctioned substantial funding and capital grants totalling £5.8 million for the provision of MRIs at these three hospitals. The scanners are now installed and will be fully commissioned in the new year.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the pace of developments in this area is fast moving, both in terms of the technologies involved and their applications. I can assure the Deputy that the evolving future needs of the acute hospital service for high-technology imaging facilities, including the possible need for a mobile MRI service, will be fully assessed before any future policy decisions are made in this important area of service provision.</P>

      <P>The following is the number of nurses, employed in the health service, by category, as recorded in the Health Service Personnel Census, for the years 1995 and 1999, 1999 is the latest year for which data is available. All numbers are expressed in wholetime equivalents, wte. It is important to note that certain grade categories were amalgamated or classified under different headings over the period in question. These factors explain the absence of data for certain categories of nursing staff for individual years. Nursing students participating in the nursing registration-diploma programmes are supernumerary to service requirements and are not part of the rostered workforce. Therefore they have been excluded from the census.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1971 there were inadequate provisions to <Col N="621" /> provide for persons who had large medical expenses. In 1971 the long-term illness scheme was introduced, whereby patients received free drugs and medicines in respect of prescribed diseases and disabilities, regardless of income. The following conditions were prescribed in 1971: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. In 1975 the following were included: multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>From 1971 onwards the general medical services, medical card, scheme came into effect. People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>At the same time a scheme to provide for the refund of the costs of drugs above a certain threshold was introduced. Currently, non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the costs of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>The introduction of these schemes ensured that no individual or family would be faced with undue financial hardship as a result of expenses on drugs and medicines. Consequently, the long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend it in view of the other schemes available.</P>

      <P>The blind welfare allowance is a supplementary payment that comes under the aegis of my <Col N="622" /> Department and forms part of special services for blind persons under the Blind Persons Act, 1920. Guidelines referring to this allowance were issued to the health boards in 1979. These guidelines stated that persons not maintained in an institution who are in receipt of the maximum blind pension or the social welfare contributory old age pension may be regarded as eligible for the blind welfare allowance at the maximum rate, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>I understand that health boards take a flexible approach in regard to this allowance. The allowance is paid if the applicant is in receipt of a Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs payment, e.g. disability allowance, invalidity pension, a blind pension or an old age pension.</P>
      <P>This allowance has been the subject of a number of modifications over the years including the following: in 1979, the supplementary blind welfare allowance payable to a blind person in receipt of a blind pension was paid at a rate of £5.50 per week for those aged over 21. By 1982, this was extended to blind persons in receipt of a blind pension, aged 18 years or over, at a rate of £11.50 per week.</P>
      <P>The blind welfare allowance is subject to the normal annual budgetary increases. The rates payable to a blind pension recipient over the age of 18 years from 1986 to the current date are as follows:</P>

      <P>The latest statistics, year to end October 2000, from An Bord Pleanála show that 48% of cases &ndash; 2,112 cases &ndash; were decided within the statutory four month objective as set down in the Local Government <Col N="624" /> (Planning and Development) Act, 1992. The average time taken to decide cases was 20.7 weeks. The delay in deciding cases has been decidedly affected by the ongoing increase in the intake of cases to date in 2000 the intake of cases is 14% higher than in 1999. In view of the pressures on the housing market, and the Government's policy objective to increase housing supply, the board now accords priority status to housing developments in excess of 30 units. In the year to end October 2000, the percentage of such cases decided within the statutory period is 62.2% with the average time taken to decide these case being 17.3 weeks. The board considers that by the end of this year priority housing appeals will exceed four months only in exceptional cases.</P>
      <P>My Department and An Bord Pleanála have been discussing on an ongoing basis a range of measures to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously in the context of the continued escalation in the number of appeals being received and the functions that will be transferred to the board in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Both the Department and the board regularly review the staffing position of An Bord Pleanála to ensure that all necessary resources are made available to the board. In this regard, in July of this year I approved an increase of 29 additional staff, nine professional planners and 20 administrative staff, which brings An Bord Pleanála's authorised staff complement to 134, excluding board members. I expect that these additional staff will assist the board in reducing the time it takes to decide appeals and my Department and the board will continue to keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The 2000 estimates for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance were framed on the basis that an average of 142,780 persons would be receiving payments throughout the year. This figure provided for a projected average live register of 165,000, an estimated 6,080 short-time workers, persons aged 65 and over, persons from the self-employed sector and smallholders and also took account of an estimated 28,300 persons who, at any time, would not be receiving payments because their claims were pending, suspended or they were signing for credits. It is now expected, based on latest returns, that the number of persons receiving payments during the year will outturn at an average of around 133,380. This represents a reduction of 9,400 on the estimates provision and will give rise to savings of £30 million approximately on the estimate for unemployment assistance and £13 million approximately on the estimate for unemployment benefit. Unemployment assistance is financed by the Exchequer and, therefore, the savings that arise on this scheme will be returned to the Exchequer. Unemployment benefit, on the other hand, is financed by PRSI contributions through the social insurance fund and the savings that arise on this scheme will be retained by the fund.</P>
      <P>The 2001 estimates for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, as they currently stand, have been framed on the basis that an average of 116,800 persons will be receiving payments throughout the year. This figure provides for a projected average live register of 136,000, an estimated 4,800 short-time workers, persons aged 65 and over and persons from the self-employed sector and also takes account of an estimated 24,000 persons who, at any time, will not be receiving payments. The overall estimates provision of 116,800 persons represents a decrease of 16,580 on the corresponding projected outturn figure of 133,380 for the current year. When taken in isolation from other factors, such as the additional cost in 2001 of the substantial 2000 and 2001 Budget improvements, this decrease gives rise to a reduction of £49 million approximately on the 2001 estimate for unemployment assistance and £27 million approximately on the 2001 estimate for unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>PRSI contributions are made by employers, employees and the self employed and are paid into the social insurance fund. The fund comprises two accounts, a current account and an investment account. I manage the current account which is used to pay for social insurance benefits and pensions. The investment account is managed by the Minister for Finance and the moneys in the investment account are managed for the benefit of the fund.</P>
      <P>The social insurance fund was initially established in 1953. From its establishment up to and including 1996, annual expenditure from the fund exceeded receipts thereby necessitating a contribution to the fund from the Exchequer. The fund was in surplus for the first time in 1997 and it is projected that the fund will have an annual surplus of £341 million in 2000. The cumulated surplus at the end of 1999 was £329 million.</P>
      <P>I am making a tabular statement available to the Deputy which details the various benefits, pensions and other payments made from the fund. Over the years the various schemes have been modified and extended and increased costs arising from these are financed from the fund. The carer's benefit introduced last October was the last new scheme to be funded from the fund. No new category of payment will be financed by the fund in 2001. As the House is aware, the social insurance fund is in a healthy financial situation at the moment. This is due to increased levels of employment, lower levels of unemployment and the buoyant economic climate generally. This surplus will not continue indefinitely as ageing of the population will greatly increase demands on the fund over the medium to long-term. Clearly, it is important that the fund's surplus should be used to best advantage having regard to emerging demands and the overall interest of its contributors. As announced recently, the Minister for Finance and I are arranging to have an early examination of possible strategies in this regard.</P>
      <P>Benefits and pensions paid from the social insurance fund: old age (contributory) pension; retirement pension; widow's-widower's (contributory) pension; widowed parent grant; deserted wife's benefit; orphan's contributory pension; disability benefit; maternity benefit; adoptive benefit; health and safety benefit; invalidity pension; occupational injuries benefits; carer's benefit; bereavement grant; unemployment benefit; free schemes (paid to social insurance beneficiaries only); treatment benefits; redundancy and insolvency payments.</P>

      <P>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme is administered on my behalf by the health boards. Under the SWA scheme, health boards can provide a basic weekly payment to eligible people who are resident in the State and who have little or no income. An assessment of a person's means and needs is carried out and where there is a shortfall in a person's income a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
      <P>The question of whether any person has a legitimate right and entitlement to reside in Ireland is a matter for the immigration authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Details of claimants' immigration status are not required or recorded in connection with any claims they may make for supplementary welfare allowance and, accordingly, officials administering the scheme have not provided any particular feedback in that regard.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the total cost in 2000 of payments made to people who are found in due course to be illegal immigrants is not available and the question of illegal immigration does not arise in connection with claims for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Board's report &ndash; 'Securing Retirement Income' &ndash; on the National Pensions Policy Initiative (NPPI) laid down a blueprint for the development of supplementary pensions provision in Ireland. It is a particularly complex and detailed report and the culmination of a lengthy consultation process with all the representatives of the Irish pensions area.</P>
      <P>On publication, the Government broadly welcomed the thrust of the proposals and I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's firm commitment to the implementation of the proposals contained in the board's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the Government has already taken action on a number of the main NPPI proposals. The Government has set up a pensions reserve fund to partly offset the future <Col N="631" /> cost of pensions &ndash; as recommended by the board &ndash; and the significant increases in the rate of the old age pension &ndash; including the increase of £10 announced in last week's budget &ndash; means we are making good progress to meeting the NPPI recommendation that the weekly rate should represent 34% of the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>In addition, acting on one of the recommendations in the report, I introduced provisions in the 1999 and 2000 Social Welfare Acts which prohibited reductions in occupational pensions already in payment to pensioners, arising from increases in social welfare pensions. This ensured that the full value of the budget increase in the social welfare pension was passed on to pensioners.</P>
    <P>In relation to outstanding NPPI recommendations, it is proposed that the forthcoming Pensions Bill will give legislative effect to these proposals. One of the key features of the Bill will be the provision of a legislative framework for the introduction and regulation of personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs). PRSAs were recommended by the board as the vehicle to facilitate increased savings for pensions and extend supplementary pensions coverage overall, especially to people who have no such cover at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also make provision for a number of other NPPI related matters, namely the Pensions Board proposals relating to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation. In the context of preparations for the Bill, I am also considering reports from the board in relation to the treatment of scheme surpluses, equal treatment, a pensions ombudsman and a compensation fund.</P>

      <P>Homeless persons have the same entitlements as any other Irish citizen in the social welfare system. The supports provided to homeless people do not discriminate against other vulnerable groups. If they are unemployed but capable of and genuinely seeking work, then they can apply for unemployment assistance. They may be paid basic supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) if they do not fulfil the conditions for any other primary weekly payment from my Department. In addition, they can also apply for payments such as rent supplement, diet supplement and exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on the same basis as any other person in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> The SWA scheme is administered on my behalf by the health boards. Under the SWA scheme, health boards can provide a basic weekly payment to eligible people who have little or no income. An assessment of a person's means and needs is carried out and where there is a shortfall in a person's income a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
    <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA. This occurs in the case of some homeless people who are being provided with full or partial board accommodation. A working group was established earlier this year comprising of representatives from relevant Departments and the health boards to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for SWA purposes. These include the level of SWA which should be paid to people who have means other than cash to partly meet their basic needs. The group will recommend any legislative or administrative changes that may be required to maximise fairness, equity, transparency and efficiency in this area. The group is now finalising its recommendations and a draft report is expected in the near future.</P>

      <P>As part of its employment support services my Department maintains contact with agencies, organisations and groups in the state and community sectors with a view to offering the widest possible choice of options to unemployed people, including older persons, who wish to re-enter the active labour market.</P>
      <P>My Department's jobs facilitators would be aware of the range of labour market programmes, educational opportunities and other similar supports which are available, in addition to the supports provided directly by my Department such as the back to work allowance and back to education scheme. Referral to the local employment service is one of the options considered by the jobs facilitators and the Department's local office staff where it is considered appropriate.</P>
      <P>There is, in addition, 1,000 ring-fenced places on the back to work allowance scheme for the very long-term unemployed (five years plus) which benefit those in the older age group who can be disproportionately represented in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware, that within the framework of PPF, the standing committee on the labour market has been mandated, on the basis of a report by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to examine, identify and <Col N="633" /> develop appropriate supports to meet the needs of those people who because of age, literacy or other barriers, are unlikely to succeed in getting and keeping a job. I understand that proposals in this regard have been circulated within the past few days by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to members of the standing committee for discussion on 15 December 2000.</P>
    <P>Finally, I understand that a strategy for encouraging older workers to stay in, or rejoin the labour force as a short-term response to meeting shortage in the labour supply is currently being considered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This work is being progressed in consultation with the social partners and may have implications for long-term unemployment among the older age groups. A preliminary report on this has been submitted to the Tánaiste for her consideration.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and advocates are comprehensively addressed. In this regard, the Government has placed the needs <Col N="636" /> of people with disabilities as a key issue on the agenda of every Government Department and public body. Last week's budget provides for a continuation of the improvements provided by the Government for people with disabilities with significant improvements in the funding for services for those with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities, in improved employment support services and in upgrading transport services to make them wheelchair-accessible.</P>
    <P>With regard to my own area of responsibility, substantial progress has been made in relation to the supports provided by my Department for people with disabilities and their carers. Last week's record social welfare budget allocation of £850 million continued with these improvements, by providing for a £10 per week increase for people with disabilities and their carers aged 66 years and over; an £8 per week increase for people with disabilities and their carers aged under 66 years; increases to be paid four weeks earlier than last year, from April 2001; fuel allowance to be extended by three extra weeks, from first week in October to late April; additional £6 per week living alone allowance to be paid to recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance, unemployability supplement and blind person's pension from April 2001; full rate disability allowance to be paid where the person's partner is in receipt of any other social welfare payment, from April 2001, weekly increases of between £35 and £46; current exemption of income, up to £150,000, from the sale of a pensioner's residence to be extended to people getting disability allowance and blind person's pension from April 2001; weekly income disregards for carer's allowance to be increased from £75 (single), £150 (couple) to £125/250 respectively, from April 2001; respite care grant to be increased from £300 to £400 and £800 grant to be paid to carers looking after two or more people; access to back to education allowance for all people with disabilities following completion of a community employment scheme; £1 million extra for Comhairle Information Service.</P>
    <P>These measures build on the other improvements which I have introduced since taking up office. For instance payments to people with disabilities and their carers have been substantially increased in real terms; a range of measures have been introduced to improve access to disability allowance for people in full-time residential care; various measures have been introduced to facilitate people with disabilities in accessing employment, training and educational opportunities; significant improvements in the assessment of capital for disability allowance purposes have been introduced leading to a five-fold increase from £2,000 to £10,000 in the amount of capital which is disregarded for means test purposes.</P>
    <P>Going forward, I intend to continue to improve and enhance the services which my Department <Col N="637" /> operates for people with disabilities and their carers to ensure that they share in the benefits of our economic success and that they have an equal opportunity to participate fully in all aspects of society.</P>
    <P>One particular issue affecting people with disabilities is the additional costs arising from disability. Arising from a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group has been established under the chair of the Department of Health and Children to examine the feasibility of the introduction of a cost of disability payment. This working group, which comprises representatives of the Departments of Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my own Department, will consult with the social partners.</P>
    <P>This is a complex area and involves a wide range of payments and services which are currently being provided by a number of separate Departments and agencies. The outcome of the work of the group will inform future policy in this area, and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes, which are not age related are designed to recognise the particular difficulties that arise following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>In Budget 2001, I announced a standard increase of £8 per week to the personal rates of various social welfare payments. This increase applies to those aged under 66 in receipt of widow(er)'s contributory pension, widow(er)'s non-contributory pension and one-parent family payment. With effect from April 2001 a widow/er under 66 years of age, receiving a widow(er)'s contributory pension, will see his or her payment rise to £89.10 per week while those on means tested payments such as the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension and the one-parent family payment will receive £85.50 per week. Widow/ers with children will also benefit from the increases in child benefit announced in the budget. From June 2001, the monthly rate of child benefit will rise to £67.50 per month for first and second children and £86 per month for third and subsequent children.</P>

      <P>A person's entitlement to a social welfare payment is determined on the basis of his or her application under a particular scheme. If it emerges from the details supplied during the course of investigations in relation to the application that he or she would be better off under another scheme, information to this effect is provided and the person is advised to opt for the more favourable payment. When more than one payment is claimed, the higher payment is made as a matter of routine. Information on the extent to which this happens in practice is not maintained.</P>
      <P>My Department places considerable emphasis on providing information on social welfare entitlements so as to ensure that people receive their full entitlements.</P>
      <P>Information is available from any of my Department's local offices throughout the country as well as from the nation-wide network of citizen information centres and other outlets.</P>
      <P>Comhairle, a new body established by me and launched in June 2000 is responsible for providing a fully comprehensive and integrated information dissemination and advocacy service for all citizens.</P>
      <P>My Department has, over the past year, issued detailed customised newsletters to 300,000 pensioners, over 100,000 recipients of disability allowance and invalidity pension, over 70,000 lone parents and over 16,000 recipients of carers allowance to inform them of their possible entitlements, including any ancillary benefits for which they might qualify.</P>
      <P>In the development of the Department's computer systems to support the business into the future, it is intended to take this process a step further by providing information on potential entitlements to people in advance, for example people approaching pension age whose record of contributions would qualify them for pension. It is my intention in this regard that people are given every facility and encouragement to ensure that they avail of their full entitlements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is concerned about the assessment of maintenance payments where they are made on behalf of a claimant for one-parent family payment. Prior to 1997 the legislation provided that maintenance payments made by a liable relative in respect of the claimant, but not in respect of the children, were assessable as means. However, section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1996, which came into operation in January 1997, provided that all maintenance payments by a liable relative, including payments in respect of children, are assessable; provision was also made to disregard contributions by way of payment of mortgage or rent not exceeding £3,900 per annum.</P>
      <P>No new regulations have been introduced in this regard during my period in office. I am not aware therefore of any new qualification tests that have introduced hardship, as inferred by the Deputy. I am open to having any such case examined if he would bring the specific circumstances to my attention.</P>
      <P>My reply to another question from the Deputy today detailed the steps that my Department takes to ensure that fair procedures are followed whenever the question of reduction or withdrawal of an entitlement due to a change of circumstances arises.</P>

    <P>Over the past 12 months, the average time taken to decide one-parent family payment type claims was 10.1 weeks in the case of unmarried claimants and 12.8 weeks in the case of claims from separated claimants. A large majority of these applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. In the case of widow/er's type claims, the average time taken to decide a claim was 4.1 weeks in the case of contributory type claims and 5.8 weeks in the case of non-contributory type claims.</P>
    <P>The relative length of time needed to process one-parent family payment applications in particular reflects the work that is required to ensure that all the statutory conditions of the scheme are met before a claim goes into payment.

    <P>It is my Department's policy to provide an efficient and effective service to all of its customers and resources are deployed appropriately to achieve this. My Department is engaged at present in a review of its work priorities and requirements in its pension services office &ndash; where the one-parent family payment scheme is administered &ndash; in the light of these changes, so as to ensure that an efficient, courteous and speedy claim processing service continues to be provided to widowed and lone parent clients.</P>

      <P>Each social welfare scheme has specific conditions that must be satisfied if a person is to qualify for payment. Schemes that are insurance-based, such as disablement benefit, use a person's social insurance contribution record to determine eligibility, while eligibility for social assistance schemes is based on a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> In addition, where illness or incapacity is concerned, medical evidence is required to prove entitlement. In the case of unemployment, a person is required to prove that s/he is capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>In all schemes there are review mechanisms to ensure that entitlement conditions continue to be satisfied. This is achieved through a process of a systematic review of appropriate cases. It is also open to a person whose circumstances have changed to request a review of his/her claim.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a breakdown as requested by the Deputy in respect of unemployment assistance. However, the following analysis of the Live Register is indicative of the general trend in relation to that scheme. There were, on average, 85,875 persons in receipt of unemployment assistance each week throughout the year. Of these, approximately 22%, or 18,892 claims, would have been assessed as having means when the claim was made and put into payment at a reduced rate.</P>
    <P>The number of unemployment assistance recipients whose claims were reviewed and whose payments were reduced following an increase in means during the past 12 months was 4,183. In relation to the scheme conditions, some 3,245 persons had their claims disallowed, i.e. payments terminated, on the grounds that they were not genuinely seeking work, while a further 3,846 were disallowed on the grounds that they were not available for work.</P>
    <P>There were 54,021 persons in receipt of disability allowance as at 30 November 2000. During the period 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000 some 8,440 disability allowance claims were </P>
    <P>reviewed. Of these, 157 recipients have had their allowance terminated on the grounds that they no longer satisfied the medical criteria for receipt of disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Entitlement was terminated in 837 cases because of changes in means.</P>
    <P>As disablement benefit is an insurance-based scheme, there were no cases of reduction in payment arising from a means test.</P>
    <P>In all cases where there was a reduction in payment, the persons concerned were informed of the decision. Anybody who is not satisfied with the decision may appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>The back to work <Col N="643" /> scheme was introduced in 1993 with the aim of encouraging long-term unemployed and lone parents to take up employment. The scheme provides a financial incentive to lone-parents and long-term unemployed persons to return to the active labour force. Participation in the scheme is voluntary and no compulsion is brought to bear on mothers or other social welfare recipients to engage in it. I have not issued any instructions that mothers on social welfare payments should return to work.</P>
      <P>Under this programme, participants are guaranteed a weekly payment for three to four years which is not affected by any other income from employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>Many mothers have been helped to return to the labour force under the back to work scheme. For example, there are just under 1,000 mothers currently in receipt of the back to work allowance who were formerly recipients of the one-parent family payment.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance has enabled this group of mothers to voluntarily return to the workforce while retaining the financial cushion of a portion of their previous social welfare payment. Many of those who came to the Scheme from the Live Register are also mothers.</P>
      <P>In Budget 2001 provision has been made for the development of a new programme which will provide an integrated guidance, mediation, counselling and referral service to lone parents. The objective will be to get the person &ldquo;job ready&rdquo; for either employment or self-employment. I am confident that many lone parents will avail of this opportunity.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the practice of &ldquo;integration&rdquo; whereby occupational pension schemes take the State old age contributory-retirement pension into account in designing the overall benefit promise being made by the scheme. I should point out that by operating integration, an employer may be able to provide a retired person with an earnings-related pension which might otherwise not be possible.</P>
      <P>In considering any issue relating to occupational pension schemes, one has to take into account that such schemes are voluntary arrangements between an employer and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> However, where such occupational schemes exist, I consider they should operate on a sound basis from the perspective of the pensioner and I have made it quite clear since I became Minister that I expect the significant increases in the old age pension which have been introduced by this Government to be passed on in full to pensioners.</P>
    <P>I have expressed concern on a number of occasions in the House regarding the less favourable aspects of integration. Accordingly, in the 1999 Social Welfare Act, I provided for a prohibition on the practice of reducing occupational pensions already in payment, as a result of increases in the social welfare pension. The effect of this measure is to prohibit occupational pensions in payment from being reduced in any one year from the level obtaining in the preceding year. Such a prohibition was recommended by the Pensions Board in its report on the national pensions policy initiative, NPPI.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, while there is little, if any, evidence that any pension scheme rules permit an actual reduction in the amount of occupational pension in payment as a result of increases in the social welfare pension, this provision will act as a preventive measure to ensure that such a rule is not, in future, introduced in a pensions scheme.</P>
    <P>While integration is generally carried out on a &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; basis at the point of retirement, in a very small number of pension schemes integration continued on an ongoing basis after retirement under a &ldquo;total pension income&rdquo; approach, which was provided for in the rules of these schemes. Therefore, I brought forward an amendment in this year's Social Welfare Act to prohibit this practice.</P>
    <P>I believe that these measures clearly signal my concerns on this issue and ensure that social welfare increases are passed on in full. However, in relation to the specific instance outlined by the Deputy, I will have the matter examined further if the Deputy wishes to provide specific details.</P>
    <P>Of course, another way of ensuring greater consistency across pension schemes in this area would be through indexation, and I can confirm that I am considering a report from the Pensions Board on the indexation of occupational pensions in the context of the forthcoming Pensions Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, pay related social insurance contributions are made by employers, employees and the self employed. The rate of PRSI contribution depends on the class of social insurance applicable which, in turn, determines the range of benefits and pensions to which contributors may, in due course, become entitled.</P>
      <P>The social insurance system has developed and improved over the years. In recent years changes have included the extension of &ldquo;partial&rdquo; social insurance to the self employed in 1988 and of full cover to part time workers in 1991 and new civil and public servants in 1995.</P>
      <P>Historically, public servants were excluded from full social insurance cover. This arose as it was viewed that such employees had provision within the terms and conditions of their employments for adequate cover for contingencies such as sickness or old age and that the risk of unemployment was not a factor in their case.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the Government announced that full rate PRSI would be extended to employees in the public sector generally and that staff interests would be fully consulted in this regard.</P>
      <P>Following detailed and extensive consultation with the staff interests involved, the revised system was brought into operation from April 1995. However, it only applied to new entrants to the public service who are now liable for full Class A PRSI contributions. There are no plans at present for a further review of the PRSI position of civil and public servants.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions are at present being reviewed. The first phase of the review was published in August this year and, amongst other things, recommended a switch to a system of assessment based on the total number of contributions paid rather than the average contribution test which currently applies. This will be examined in more detail in the next phase of the review which will get under way in the new year.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to award pensions to public servants along the lines suggested by the Deputy. That said, a number of measures introduced in recent years have made contributory pensions more accessible to those with mixed or reduced insurance records. These measures include the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions, a reduction in the average number of contributions required to ten and, more recently, the introduction of reduced pensions based on pre-1953 insurance. Former public servants are one of the groups benefiting from these measures.</P>

      <P>Income maintenance payments available under the social welfare code consist of a range of social insurance benefits which are paid on the basis of PRSI contributions and a further range of social assistance payments which are payable subject to a means test to people who are not qualified for insurance-based payments.</P>
      <P>Means-testing has been a feature of the social welfare system since the introduction of the first social welfare payment &ndash; the old age non-contributory pension &ndash; in 1908. The purpose of the means tests is to ensure that for those who do not have social insurance cover or who have insufficient contributions to qualify for benefit, the resources available are targeted at those most in need.</P>
      <P>The legislative basis for means tests currently operated by my Department is contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and subsequent amending Acts and in regulations made under those Acts.</P>

The ark has been very successful since it opened in 1995 and is now regarded as a centre of excellence of arts provision for children. However due to this very success its building in Temple Bar has reached operational capacity. The new action plan, which is costed at more than £2 million has the aim of extending access to the arts programmes and activities of the ark through the development of innovative outreach and touring initiatives and through the use of information technology. In particular the action plan will promote initiatives to provide access to the arts for children that for reasons of social or economic exclusion, ill health or special needs cannot access the programmes that take place in the current ark building in Temple Bar.</P>

      <P>Under the Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness the Government agreed that &ldquo;a fair level of compensation shall be paid, having regard to the level and extent of restriction and all reasonable losses arising as a result of SPA/SAC designation and to the difference between the value pre-designation for environmental purposes and the subsequent value of the land consequent on designation as an SPA/SAC.&rdquo; Provision for such compensation is also included in the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of this commitment, a farm plan will be drawn up when requested by any farmer whose land lies within an SAC and who does not chose to join the REP scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.

      <P>Much as some of my Donegal colleagues would wish it to be so, I wish to advise the Deputy that Ulster Gaelic has not become a third national language. The two official languages of the State are the Irish Language and English. I presume the Deputy has Ulster-Scots in mind. It is not intended to amend the Constitution of Ireland to include Ulster-Scots as a national language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement made specific provisions in relation to the Irish Language.How<Col N="650" /> ever the only provision in relation to UlsterScots is as follows: &ldquo;All participants recognise the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland, the Irish language, Ulster-Scots and the languages of the various ethnic communities, all of which are part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 established An Foras Teanga, the North-South Language Body &ndash; a body with two separate parts which has functions relating to the Irish language and to Ullans, or Ulster-Scots, which is the variety of the Scots language traditionally found in parts of Northern Ireland and Donegal.</P>
    <P>The body has the following functions in relation to the Irish language which are exercised through Foras na Gaeilge:</P>
    <P>promotion of the Irish language; facilitating and encouraging its use in speech and writing in public and private life in the South and, in the context of Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, in Northern Ireland where there is appropriate demand;</P>
    <P>advising both administrations, public bodies and other groups in the private and voluntary sectors; undertaking supportive projects, and grant-aiding bodies and groups as considered necessary; undertaking research, promotional campaigns, and public and media relations; developing terminology and dictionaries; supporting Irish-medium education and the teaching of Irish.</P>
    <P>In relation to Ulster-Scots, the function of the body (which is exercised through That Board Of Ulster-Scots) is the promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulster Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has applied in the United Kingdom for a transfer to serve the balance of his sentence here under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. Officials in my Department were informed yesterday by the United Kingdom authorities that they have just completed collating the necessary documents required in respect of the formal application and that it has now been transmitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>As I have explained in the past, the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, require a three-way consent to enable any transfer to take place i.e. consent from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. The consents can only be given once all parties are fully aware of the legal consequences of a transfer. On receipt of the formal application, my officials will begin the process necessary to ensure that all procedures required under the Convention are completed in good time. Once the required consents have been given, an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to complete this process as quickly as possible assuming the necessary consents are forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I am informed that some Dublin-based members of the IMPACT Trade Union, Mapping Branch, are involved in industrial action and are refusing to carry out certain core functions such as dealing with fee-paying customers at the Land Registries public counters in Dublin. I am further informed that the senior mapping grades of mapping advisor and chief superintendent are not supporting the action, while all Waterford based staff represented by the union are continuing to work as normal.</P>
      <P>I understand that the union's position is that none of the additional posts arising under a recent staffing package should be filled by reference to work-related needs in Waterford. This ignores the fact that the Land Registry has a decentralised office in Waterford where 35% to 40% of the work is handled. The union is also demanding that no staff should be promoted in Waterford until all Dublin based staff at a particular level have been promoted and left in Dublin. I am informed that this would be untenable for the operation of the Land Registry and its fee-paying customers.</P>
      <P>I understand that contact has been maintained with the union with a view to recommencing talks and finding a way forward. In the meantime management in the Land Registry regrets any inconvenience which may arise for its customers as a result of the action taken by IMPACT and will endeavour to maintain essential services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently announced an expansion of Garda CCTV systems. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed in the period 2001-2002. While these Garda systems will be funded by my Department, co-funding will also be a feature of them and will be addressed when detailed costings are available and before work on the installation of the CCTV systems commences.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme in 2001 to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the gardaí will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme, including relevant conditions and grant levels, will be announced early in the new year.</P>
      <P>A total of £12 million has been allocated to the installation of CCTV systems  &ndash; both Garda and local community &ndash; nationwide over the next three years &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001. Following an initial assessment of each area by the Garda authorities, a detailed request for tender document will be drawn up setting out the specifications for each system-area in order to allow a competitive tendering process, in line with EU and public procurement guidelines, to be held. The completed tenders must then be evaluated before contracts can be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> The Deputy will appreciate that the exact number of cameras in each area may differ and will depend largely upon Garda advice in this regard. In the circumstances, it is not possible for me to say at this stage how much of the moneys allocated are for a particular project. Detailed costings will, of course, be available when tenders have been evaluated and selected for particular areas. However, it is the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is on average £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, to conduct a survey of radon levels in schools in 1998. All schools recognised by my Department were invited to participate. The survey is being conducted in three phases. The results of phase one of the survey were released to the participating schools in January this year. In November this year, the results of phase two of the survey were released to schools in the counties participating in that phase. Phase three of the survey is under way at present and the result are expected next year.</P>
      <P>In May this year the &ldquo;Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000&rdquo; (Statutory Instrument No. 125 of 2000) gave effect to the most recent revision of the EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive (Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM). This sets a national reference level for radon in workplaces of 400 bqMf7&gt;3 over any three-month period. If radon levels are in excess of this, an employer must evaluate whether remedial measures should be undertaken and, if so, such measures should be undertaken as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>Remedial measures are complete in 13 of the worst affected schools that participated in phase I of the survey. Arrangements are in hand to have remedial work carried out in another 20 schools with maximum radon levels in a range between 404 bqMf7&gt;3 and 573 bqMf7&gt;3 and it is expected that this work will be completed by January 2001. The RPII has indicated that 23 schools should be given priority when arranging mitigation measures for the schools in phase two with a maximum radon level in excess of 200 bqMf7&gt;3. These schools will be visited by an expert in radon mitigation in January 2001 with a view to having specifications for radon mitigation systems for these schools produced. As soon as the specifications are available arrangements will be made to install the systems.</P>
      <P>A pilot study of the natural ventilation in ten schools with maximum radon levels of between 200 bqMf7&gt;3 and 400 bqMf7&gt;3 is under way at present. The purpose of the study is to establish whether passive ventilation systems can be used to mitigate radon levels in this range, as opposed to the mechanical systems that have been, or are in the process of being, installed in the schools with higher levels. The results of the study are expected in January 2001 and these will allow my Department to plan a mitigation programme for the schools with maximum radon levels in excess of 200 bqMf7&gt;3 but not exceeding 400 bqMf7&gt;3. Meanwhile, my Department is advising schools that increasing the natural ventilation in affected rooms, where this can be achieved without discomfort to the users of those rooms, may be effective in reducing the level of radon.</P>

      <P>My Department does not prescribe any special rules for the treatment of pregnant girls by school authorities. However, my Department would expect that in dealing with any particular case, school management would have regard to the sensitivity of the situation and would have as its priority the well-being of the pupil concerned. My Department would hope the pregnancy would cause no more than a temporary absence from school and each pupil would be in a position to resume her education following the birth of the child.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that no two sets of circumstances will be identical and, accordingly, management practice will vary from case to case. Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving suitable medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl's needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected.</P>
      <P>Home tuition is provided to pregnant school girls who are pupils at recognised schools. It is provided to pupils who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby, when attendance may be impractical.</P>
      <P>The intention is to provide compensatory instruction during the time immediately before or after the birth of their babies when attendance at school may be impractical. It is intended that the tuition will minimise the disruption to the girls' education and so maximise their chance of continuing in school to complete the senior cycle, which is in line with Government policy to improve school retention rates; that it will enable pupils to sit the junior certificate or leaving certificate examinations at the earliest possible opportunity, and that it will be an indication to schools who are expected to support pregnant schoolgirls that my Department is willing to offer these pupils some practical support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements made at examination time for a pregnant girl depend on her particular circumstances at the time: 1. A candidate may not wish to sit for her examinations in the main centre, in which case she may take her exams in a special room in the school. If a candidate is in hospital, arrangements can be made for her to <Col N="659" /> take her exams there; 2. If a candidate feels unwell during the course of the examinations, she may be allowed leave the examination centre and be readmitted provided that she has been in the care of the principal or a representative of the school authority during her absences. In exceptional circumstances, a candidate may take the examinations at a later time than the scheduled time but on the same day.</P>

      <P>The School Attendance Act, 1926, with minor amendments, is the legislative framework for compulsory school attendance in the State. Under existing legislation, school attendance committees in certain parts of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Waterford provide the school attendance service. In the remainder of the country, the Garda Síochána provides the service.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Education (Welfare) Act was passed by the Oireachtas this year. The purpose of that Act is to provide for a new structure to address problems of poor school attendance. The Act provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board and a nation-wide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education. That board will be charged with the employment of educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to treat problems of poor school attendance, with particular focus on areas of disadvantage. That Act also provides for the transfer of all existing school attendance officers to the National Educational Welfare Board upon the commencement of the appropriate section of the Act.</P>
      <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to it under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provision of the Act will be commenced as appropriate. It is envisaged that membership of the board would, as far as possible, mirror that of the final board.</P>
      <P>I have requested nominations to the board from the education partners and relevant Government Departments. I expect to be in a position to establish the designate board in the near future.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-<Col N="662" /> February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
    <P>Similarly, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to depart from these indices as a guideline.</P>
    <P>In the present financial year expenditure on student support, including free fees, is expected to be about £250 million. In view of the scale of expenditure involved and the representations being made by students and other groups, I announced, on 11 November, that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>
    <P>Also, there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan and I have established an action group on access to third level education to advise on measures which would tackle under-representation by disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>As an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>

      <P>There are currently 104.5 serving staff and 15 vacancies in the administrative, professional and technical grades in the planning and building unit of my Department, all dealing with planning and building projects at primary level, second level and third level. There are in excess of 2,250 projects currently being processed.</P>
      <P>The length of time required to complete a school building project, from inception to completion, varies very substantially.</P>
      <P>In the case of all major projects, my Department in the first instance has to undertake an assessment of the long-term needs of an area to determine if the level of school accommodation sought is warranted by virtue of the current and projected enrolments. This process requires that some attention be focused on the possibilities, if any, for rationalisation of existing schools within the area.</P>
      <P>The availability of a suitable site assists enormously in the delivery of a new building. When it is necessary to acquire a site, the identification of a site, negotiating with the landowner, procurement of valuation, procurement of outline planning permission, and attending to conveyance matters all take time to complete.</P>
      <P>The process of appointing a design team to commence the planning process also impacts on delivery times. Compliance with EU procurement procedures alone takes a minimum of three to four months to complete.</P>
      <P>The rate of progress to construction depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team and my Department's building unit, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors.</P>
      <P>The number of projects proceeding to tender and construction in a particular year is also governed by the allocation of funding for school buildings in that year.</P>
      <P>A broad ranging review of business practices within the building unit of my Department is under way. The core objectives of this review are to streamline practices and to require school management authorities to manage their projects more actively. I am pleased to say that the review is nearing completion.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he will fund schools for secretarial and care-taking services in order that they can meet their commitments under the Minimum Wage Act.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. Pay scales for secretaries under this scheme, as for secretaries and caretakers employed in the comprehensive and community and VEC school sectors, are determined centrally.</P>
      <P>However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>At primary level I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January this year. furthermore, with effect from September of this year, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>At second level, in addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this additional annual funding is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet these commitments.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, which was published in December 1999, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children aged from birth to six years.</P>
      <P>Action is proposed on a wide range of issues, including the promotion of quality of provision, measures to facilitate and encourage parental involvement in their children's early education and the development of a system of evaluation to determine whether providers meet quality standards and to assist them in doing so.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, departmental officials carried out an extensive post-consultation process with all of those who made presentations to the national forum. The aim of the consultations was to seek the views of interested parties with regard to the implementation of the policies set out in the White Paper, on a phased basis, in line with the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Following the consultation process, officials from my Department undertook considerable planning for implementation. Most recently, as an initial move towards implementation, my Department has invited third level institutions to submit proposals for a pilot project to develop early childhood education provision in pursuance of the objectives in the White Paper. The pilot project will include, in particular, the development of early education quality standards in relation to equipment and materials, staff qualifications, training, learning objectives, methodologics and curriculum; the development of a support framework to encourage compliance with quality standards by early education providers; the co-ordination and enhancement of early education provision with a particular focus on disadvantaged and special needs groups; and the commissioning of a programme of research and development through which best practice in curriculum, teaching methodology and parent involvement may be implemented and evaluated.</P>
      <P>Following assessment of these proposals, I will be in a position to make further announcements about future developments in the early education area.</P>

      <P>The data to which the Deputy refers are provisional outturn figures which were based on the position as forecast in October 2000. The original capital allocation for national schools in 2000 was £81 million and the forecast was that it would be fully expended before year end. However, there was a projected saving of £1 million on the allocation of £4.775 million for special schools for young offenders due to a slower than anticipated level of expenditure on projects for that area.</P>
      <P>The provisional outturn figures also indicated that £17 million additional capital at second level was required to greater than estimated progress with projects. In order to maintain the momentum, of improvement in this sector, I have sought and obtained the additional sum of £17 million in the Supplementary Estimates for Education Votes for 2000.</P>

      <P>The length of time taken to process applications for capital funding varies depending on the complexity of the proposal and the resources available.</P>
      <P>My Department does not grant aid the provision of student accommodation. However, in recognition of the difficulties facing the student population in finding good affordable accommodation, the Government introduced tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999.</P>

    <P>The ERC began preliminary work on the project in April 1998. The first phase of the study was presented at a special meeting of the council of directors at the end of August 2000. It is expected that the report on the first phase will be formally presented to my Department shortly. The second phase of the study commenced at the beginning of November 2000 and is expected to be completed in May 2001.

      <P>The abridged Estimates and the budget for 2001 are the first stages in the process of determining specific allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education for the next financial year. It is normal practice to review and adjust expenditure provisions in the light of more up to date outturn figures prior to the publication of the revised estimated volume. This process will extend over the next number of weeks and I will convey details concerning the matters raised by the Deputy when final decisions are taken.</P>

      <P>With effect from 1 September 2000, administrative principals are appointed to all schools with seven or more mainstream class teachers. In addition, schools with a principal plus 11 or more teachers, including ex-quota posts, may appoint an administrative principal.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition costs of eligible students, who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of introducing free fees for part-time students generally, similar to those given to full time students, could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. <Col N="676" /> However, the White Paper on Adult Education, &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;, indicates that arrangements will be implemented so that higher education fees, in respect of certain courses, will not apply to part-time students, who satisfy the residency clause, and who are social welfare means-tested or unemployment payment recipients or dependants, medical card holders or dependants, persons in receipt of family income supplement or dependants.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1996, as amended by the Finance Act, 1997, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses which are of a minimum duration of two years and are followed in colleges approved for the higher education grants scheme or in colleges which satisfy the prescribed codes of standards.</P>
    <P>In the 1997 Finance Act provision was made to extend tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses operated by colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State.</P>
    <P>In relation to the above reliefs, the maximum level of qualifying fees is £2,500.</P>
