      <P>The meeting in Waterford on 9 May 2000 was the third regional meeting of the Government. It was the first meeting to involve an overnight stay. The costs arising to my Department have yet to be calculated but will be in the order of £6,000.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Quinn</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>when the proposed new position of solicitor to the Director of Public Prosecutions will be created; if legislation will be required before the new post is created; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12761/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The public prosecutions system study group recommended, among other things, that the Director of Public Prosecutions should consider delegating to the solicitor to the DPP certain categories of decision at present reserved to the director. The Government has agreed in principle to the recommendations of the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of an office of solicitor to the DPP and the transfer of functions from the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office to the new office has taken some time because of detailed and ongoing negotiations between the official side and the union side in relation to staffing and resources. It is hoped that those negotiations will reach finality in the near future. When that happens, arrangements will be put in place to fill the position of solicitor to the DPP and, thereafter, transfer of staff from the <Col N="950" /> criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office to the new office will take place.</P>
    <P>It is not anticipated that legislation will be required before the new post of solicitor to the DPP is created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the establishment of this post is an urgent matter? Will he detail what the negotiations are concerned with in relation to resources and, perhaps, salaries? There is a tight labour market at present, as we are aware in the context of the Chief State Solicitor's office. Will the Taoiseach outline the exact position with regard to additional resources and the level of remuneration the post will command?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The current negotiations involve IMPACT, the Department of Finance, the Office of the DPP, the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office. A significant degree of progress has been made. The DPP has given a commitment that he will not move on the post of solicitor to the DPP until the whole package is agreed. That will involve further promotional posts. It will involve additional allowances for people who stay on because they have been having difficulty. It will involve additional staff and it will also involve changes in the accommodation because, as I understand it, even if they had the extra staff today, they could not accommodate them in the castle. That issue must be resolved also. While they are ready to go ahead with the post of solicitor to the DPP, in the partnership arrangements on which they have agreed to work in recent months the DPP has given the assurance that he will wait until all of these matters are concluded. The state of play is that the negotiations are all put completed. A comprehensive offer will be made to the staff side and it has stated that it must ballot on that. If there is a satisfactory result in that, then all of the matters can move together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it the staff side and the management have linked a variety of related issues but not specifically the position of an additional solicitor directly appointed to the DPP? While the outcome of those negotiations is all but completed, given our appointment procedure on this, is the reality that this would be a Civil Service Commission appointment? Will this person, whoever he or she may be, not effectively take up the responsibilities until late this year or early next year? Is that a fair assessment of the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take a few months anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>He can forget the next three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be about three months from the time of commencement. I am not too sure how the profession will view it, but it will be <Col N="951" /> an important position. The solicitor to the DPP would have the same relationship and status as that of the Chief State Solicitor to the Attorney General. I imagine that it would be seen in the profession as an attractive post. I hope we will move fairly quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why it was decided to create a separate post rather than simply recruit a senior solicitor in the DPP's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This came from the Nally report. The Nally report recommended that, subject to the agreement of adequate staffing levels and appropriate structures, the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office and the solicitor service would be transferred to the DPP to form a unit and that that unit would be headed by a solicitor to the DPP. Rather than just nominating or designating somebody who was there, it would be the creation of a new post. That was one of the recommendations which was accepted. All the recommendations were accepted, but it was one of the recommendations from the public prosecutions system study group report of the year before last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What will be the reporting relationship between the solicitor to the DPP and the DPP? Will the solicitor to the DPP exercise any separate legal functions in his or her own right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The relationship will be the same relationship as that of the Attorney General to the Chief State Solicitor. The report spells out that because the DPP has no real power and no real management role over the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office although practically all the work of that office is the DPP's work, it should be transferred to him. The same is the case with the State solicitor service. More than 80% of the work of the State solicitor service is directed to the DPP. For reasons of administrative consistency these divisions will be transferred to the DPP, but he will have a new unit and a new person who will effectively administer and manage it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the relationship will be the normal one between solicitor and client and that the client, that is the DPP, will make all the important decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The DPP will still make the decisions. Of the 230 staff in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, 70 are in the criminal division. These will move to the new office. The solicitor to the DPP will be responsible for the criminal division. The Nally report also recommended that the work of the 32 State solicitors should transfer to the Office of the DPP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, 11 May I launched the new performance management and development system for the Civil Service in Dublin Castle. This system is the culmination of a wide-ranging and inclusive consultative process, including formal discussions between management and unions. Entitled Excellence through Performance &ndash; Moving Forward Together, the performance management and development system is designed to be practical and workable and to provide objectivity and fairness in its implementation. It is based on clearly identifying roles and the range of competencies that each person needs to fulfil his or her role. I have laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas the information pack on this system, which sets out its main features, and my speech at the launch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness identified as one of its key objectives the implementation of this system in each Department and office. A major investment is being made in training for implementation which is being led by the <Col N="953" /> centre for management organisation and development in the Department of Finance. Project teams have been established in each organisation, including my Department, to facilitate implementation. Implementation plans are now being developed in my Department. The role of partnership committees in implementing and further developing the process in individual organisations will be essential.</P>
    <P>I last briefed the Dáil on progress under the strategic management initiative in October last. At that time I referred to the launch last July of the next phase of the SMI and to the specific initiatives which were designed to improve the functioning of the Civil Service and its capacity to deliver high quality services effectively. The following table sets out the progress of various elements of the SMI.</P>
    <P>The agreement of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with its focus on public service modernisation, will facilitate the speedy implementation of the framework for public service modernisation, with particular emphasis on developing a sectoral approach. Strategies for the Civil Service, the education, health and local authority sectors, are set out in detail. The programme also makes a specific link between the achievement of performance indicators relating to the modernisation programme and the payment of the final 4% of the pay agreement.</P>
    <P>Within my Department, significant progress is being made on the SMI agenda, particularly in relation to performance management and financial management. Indeed, an advertisement will shortly be placed for a professional accountant to assist with financial management changes in the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> On the specific issue of regulatory reform, the following are the main developments: in July last the Government published Reducing Red Tape &ndash; An Action Programme of Regulatory Reform in Ireland. Among other things, the action programme required each Department and office to consult with customers and other interested parties as to the priorities for regulatory reform. Based on those consultations, each Department and office has now listed the relevant legislation, both primary and secondary, and the regulatory reform unit and statute law revision unit in the Office of the Attorney General have been working closely to establish priorities for a work programme of consolidation, revision, repeal or restatement, as appropriate. Consultation with Departments and offices on this programme is ongoing. When completed, the work programme will be submitted by me to Government for its approval.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting, the Government agreed to the publication of a Bill which will empower the Attorney General to prepare versions of Acts of the Oireachtas, to be known as restatements, in a more readable form without altering the substance of the legislation and, accordingly, will not require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The aim of this proposal is to make statute law more accessible and readable. It is expected that the Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible. The OECD is undertaking a country review of regulatory reform in Ireland, which will be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>These initiatives demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to try to make it easier to do business with Government and to make legislation more coherent and accessible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are the key features of the new performance management and development system phrased exclusively in terms of objectives without reference to the overriding consideration in the public service, which is the provision of a service based on integrity in all actions taken and a sense of serving the public? Is there not a risk that the focus placed on concrete objectives will distort the service element in favour of selected measurable phenomena that can be logged for the purposes of career development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The new system does not do away with existing regulations given to civil servants when they enter the Civil Service. They are concerned with the principle of service to the State and include all the rules and regulations on ethics, the decision making process and dealing with official information, including the Official Secrets Act. This next phase attempts to build on the strategic management initiatives that have been undertaken in the past number of years. To date there have been seven initiatives and an attempt has been made to work through all of them, which has involved an enormous amount of consultation. An enormous amount of work has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While those involved would probably say they have not achieved all they would like, they have made a huge difference. They have dealt with the customer service initiative, which seeks to ensure departmental staff work to their Departments' statements of objectives. These include additional initiatives to those referred to by the Deputy to ensure staff provide a better service. They also deal with human resource management issues, <Col N="956" /> which include performance management and IT issues. The Civil Service is involved in an enormous amount of work in the IT area. All Departments and agencies are drawing up IT programmes to try to work more efficiently through information technology.</P>
    <P>Consideration is being given to a performance management and development system, which I hope will assist the staff. With regard to much of what has happened to date, especially practices over the years, the CMOD in the Department of Finance and other agencies, such as the IPA and the IMI, which has worked with the Civil Service, would claim not enough effort has been put into the staff aspect.</P>
    <P>This development will in a few years link matters to the third round of the pay agreement. More importantly, it will mean staff training. The 20,000 plus civil servants will receive training, at least a minimum of five days in the first instance, in an effort to introduce professional training management techniques into the Civil Service. This has not happened in the past. People take up their jobs, are assigned to a Department and to a large extent are left to paddle their own canoes in the absence of proper management techniques. This area has been highlighted as requiring major work, which is what this performance management initiative is about.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is very important that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water? Does he also agree one of the strongest characteristics of the State since its foundation has been the integrity of the public <Col N="957" /> service? The introduction of what are described as the T range of competencies, including clarity in terms of objective, role, career expectations, control in terms of participation and contribution in terms of a business plan are welcome, as are all the other new management oriented and private sector derived ideas. However, does the Taoiseach agree a performance management system that does not put fundamental characteristics &ndash; such as fairness to all citizens, regardless of their stations or allegiances in life or their personal preferences &ndash; ahead of all other management school derived notions runs the risk of loosing something very precious in the public service, which is its integrity that has survived largely intact throughout much turbulence since the State was founded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but that has not been lost. It has not been thrown out. It is still part of the fundamental contract. The integrity of the public service is still number one in the review of the 1956 Act on the Civil Service Commission, on which work is ongoing. It will be next year before it is amended and it will be 45 years next year since that was last done. These other initiatives are perhaps in management terms, but they are that the public and civil service work to their own strategy statement which more than ever before, takes account of for whom they are meant to work, which is the public. Their efforts and techniques are to ensure that in the modern public service, they will gear their work and their efforts towards serving the public. With 6,000 employees in revenue and 5,500 in social welfare, it is important that exercise takes place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach and his senior colleagues in Government recognise that there is a crisis in the public service, but particularly the Civil Service, and that for the first time since the foundation of the State, the Civil Service as a body is having serious difficulty in attracting new entrants? It has major difficulty in ensuring that entrants who go through the procedure of the exams and who find themselves on a panel are actually available to take up a job when an offer is made. Would he agree there has been a virtual haemorrhaging out of the Department of Foreign Affairs of third secretary grade people who have had three or four years experience in the public service in a job that previously was regarded as a plum job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does he accept, broadly speaking, and he has more access to the detail than I have, that there is a transformation in the perception of the public service in general and the Civil Service in particular in the labour market and that we need to do something very quickly to maintain the quality of intake that have previously joined and to ensure that those who join have a satisfactory work environment? If the Taoiseach accepts the broad thrust of that presentation, when will the PMDS system, which was launched by him just over two weeks ago in Dublin Castle, transform itself into <Col N="958" /> an effective performance related pay system that will reward people who go the extra mile in a manner that does not disrupt existing hierarchical structures? When will we see the flattening of those hierarchical structures?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the broad analysis. There is no need for me to go through each point. There is a pull from so many other professions given the advantages in them. I was in UCD very recently and from a group 184 students, more than 150 had signed up for jobs, provided they obtained their degrees. We are living in a different age.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the class of accountants graduating this year, every single student doing his or her finals has a job and contract pending results. I cannot argue against the analysis as that is a fact. I have seen very good clerical workers in my office leave to receive, on the Monday they started in the new job, increases of more than £5,000 on what they were earning on the Friday on which they left the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact of life. As to what we are doing about it, performance management is fundamentally important. Deputy Quinn was kind enough to give up his time, which was appreciated on that day, for the presentations and the launch. He had a deep interest in this from when he was Minister for Finance and he worked with CMOD. They hope to start immediately to review two major elements of work. One is the amendment of the 1956 Act. Under an earlier process, they could work slowly, but that was in a different day. The review is being conducted by the former Secretary to the Government and former Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The second aspect is the design and implementation of systems and the introduction of team programmes not just in the Civil Service but also in the health service employers group and local authorities. The objective is to improve organisational flexibility and better targeting and training. The days of assigning young educated people to a particular Department without checking on how they are getting on, the work they are doing and the training provided are over. That we got away with this for so long&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not getting away with it any more. They are walking out the door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. This has to happen very quickly. As the Deputy is aware, having attended the launch, the final payment of 4% under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is linked to implementation of work programmes. Why am <Col N="959" /> I doing this job? For whom am I working? What is my job? What are we trying to do? These are issues which have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The fifth question is, &ldquo;Why am I being paid the same amount of money as the fellow at the end of the corridor who does not come in?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that the old system of appraisals which was meant to identify and overcome those difficulties did not work well.</P>
      <P>On performance management, it will be difficult in the civil and public service to link staff in a particular area and say, &ldquo;You are going to get this&rdquo; and &ldquo;You are not going to get that&rdquo; but there are other ways of doing it. At present a line manager &ndash; for example, the important grade of principal officer &ndash; cannot bring his or her staff out for an evening with a view to creating motivation. The regulations on these matters are not followed by the commercial State companies. There is a need to ease up in the Civil Service. One cannot build team spirit if one is not allowed any vouched expenses. There is a need for such techniques. I agree with the Deputy that if we fail to do this urgently we will face a crisis in ten or 15 years when we will not have the people in leadership positions that we have had since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>There has been too much emphasis on the status attached to grades. While there is a need for grading structures, it is even more important to take into consideration what people are trying to do and give them due respect and recognition. Whether one is 19th or 59th in the Civil Service it has to be recognised that one is doing a job. Without being over-critical that has not always happened in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

The statements of management practice which were considered at the time &ndash; codes of practice were considered &ndash; may even have replaced them but I am not sure of that. The SMI implementation group's focus was to have statements from Departments on what they were doing. The efforts were placed on the performance management system, human resource management and IT systems. The code of practice may have fallen out along the way, but I will check it for the Deputy.</P>

They believe that the most effective approach is to facilitate entry to the insurance link service by those Departments with a significant volume of personal injury claims rather than providing a central service through the Chief State Solicitor's office.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, if a Department wishes to join on an individual case, it must provide all the information to the insurance link service and provide the relevant data. If one is a member, any data required will be checked within the system. It is working and I have seen what happens concerning individual cases. If one has a case or a complaint, one gives the full data and it is checked through the system.</P>
      <P>The insurance link system will give one the information. If an individual &ndash; Mr. X &ndash; has lodged claims against corporations, health boards or private sector companies, the system can provide a full profile of that individual. There are problems and a number of legal issues have been considered involving the Data Protection Act and the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act. There is also a need to consult Departments and to put clear procedures in place regarding the nature of information for release to the insurance link service. This is what has delayed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> There are also difficulties with giving PRSI numbers but one would have to give all the information. It would be necessary to advise claimants that information supplied could be provided to the insurance link service and shared with insurance companies and other bodies. However, that information has to be given if one is a member of the system. The advantage is that one can check within the system whether a person has lodged multiple claims and where they lodged those claims, thereby reducing the risk caused by people who are abusing the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Exchequer funds are the target of such claims, why is the Government taking the view that it is optional for each Department to join the insurance link service? Surely there is an overriding and comprehensive Government interest in ensuring that vexatious and repetitive claims against Departments by litigious individuals are monitored as a national overriding interest rather than dealing with this issue on a case by case, option by option departmental basis as to whether we pool the information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason is that some Departments have little or no claims against them. Large Departments which have a number of claims against them will join. However, some Departments have little or no claims against them and they are the only ones which have been opting out.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand this. What cost is involved in joining an information pooling system? The cost will arise only in regard to individual transactions of pooling of information. If a Department did not have any claims, it would not have any information to pool. Therefore, it would not have any costs associated with transmitting the information, or is there some fixed fee per Department joining this system, regardless or whether it has any claims, and, if so, why?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's answers are not satisfactory. This is Question Time. I asked a reasonable question about the cost of joining a service, in respect of which I tabled a question with due notice to the Taoiseach. I can understand he does not have the answer with him, but his brief should be prepared more thoroughly in future so that he can answer a very foreseeable supplementary question of this nature.</P>

      <P>The Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's office consider that some Departments &ndash; I am not sure of the number involved &ndash; need not join the insurance link service because they do not have a volume of personal injury claims that would justify their joining it. Some Departments may not have personal injury claims or the claims they have can be handled easily in the traditional way or the claimants involved are not abusing the system. The insurance link system is designed to catch abusers and check who is abusing the system. If there is not an advantage to a Department in the link system because it does not have claimants who are abusing the system, there is not any point in it joining. That is the answer to the Deputy's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Department has very few claims and on that basis does not join the service and it is the victim of claims from a serial claimant, is it not the case that it will not know a rare claim it receives is being made by a common claimant who is claiming against other Departments because the Government has told it that it does not have to make a decision to join this scheme? They can opt out or opt in if they so <Col N="964" /> wish. Is one of the purposes of Government not to simplify decision making? If a single decision could be taken by the Cabinet that all 17 Departments should join, it would be over and done with. If, on the other hand, the Government adopts the approach it is taking, where each of the 17 Departments has to make its own separate decision, God only knows when they will join the scheme. That is not efficient, to use the terms of the strategic management initiative, about which the Taoiseach has been holding forth with such eloquence for the past half hour.</P>

Will the Taoiseach agree there are many Departments in the public service which have little or no likelihood of having a personal injuries claim? Will he agree that the Deputy could possibly illustrate a number of Departments such as the Department of the Public Service, the Department of Foreign Affairs and many more that have never had a personal injuries claim? In those circumstances will the Taoiseach agree that the case he has consistently presented is one that should be credible even to Deputy Bruton?</P>

      <P>In reply to both questions, that is obviously the attitude of the Attorney General to the Chief State Solicitor's office. In reply to Deputy Bruton who asked if all Departments could join, under the Data Protection Act it is not just a question of all Departments signing up, there is a need to consult Departments. Clear procedures have to be in place regarding the nature of information to be released under the service. They have to advise claimants and must have a system to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The former Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, began his work at the end of January. He is the sole member of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings. I have made clear that, if the former Chief Justice requires any additional resources or support, this will be provided. Detailed terms of reference in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were agreed with the former Chief Justice and the Justice for the Forgotten group representing the injured and bereaved relatives some time ago. Mr. Hamilton is currently engaged in his examination of these bombings.</P>
      <P>While it had been hoped the former Chief Justice would have been able to submit his report on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings before the summer break, it is understood that this will not now be possible, although it is hoped that the report will be available in September.</P>
      <P>Discussions between the relevant Departments and offices on the detailed terms of reference for the examination of the Dundalk bombing are close to finalisation, following which they will be the subject of consultation with the legal representatives of the victims' relatives and with Mr. Hamilton. As regards the specific case raised by the Deputy, I have received a number of representations to have a public inquiry held into it. However, the best way forward in my view is for the Government to extend the remit of Mr. Hamilton to this case on a basis broadly similar to that which applies in the case of the DublinMonaghan bombings. In this regard, discussions between the Departments and offices concerned on the detailed terms of reference are close to a conclusion, following which proposals will be put before the Government. If approved by the Government, the proposed terms will be the subject of consultation with Mr. Hamilton and with the legal representatives of the victim's relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also received representations seeking different forms of examination of other cases of concern referred to in the report of the Victims Commission, such as the earlier Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Castleblaney bombing of 1976 and a fatal shooting at the bridge between Lifford and Strabane in 1971. Commissioner Wilson's report, while not recommending that these cases should be the subject of a formal inquiry, recommended that &ldquo;the Government, taking <Col N="966" /> heed of the need to preserve the confidentiality and safety of information, should, on request from the families of victims, produce reports on the investigations of murders arising from the conflict over the past 30 years where no one has been made amenable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will shortly make a submission to Government on the report of the Victims Commission and this will take account of the report's recommendation in relation to these other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Is he aware of the concern of the relatives of the victims, notwithstanding the fact that these outrages go back 28 years or more? The relatives are most concerned that progress is made. Will he indicate if he is happy that Mr. Hamilton will be in a position to issue a definitive report by the end of this year, if not sooner?</P>
      <P>I understand representations have been made to the Government to have the terms of reference of Mr. Hamilton's inquiry altered to include the killing of Mr. Séamus Ludlow. Is the Government giving consideration to that request? Will the matter be included in the terms of reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Hamilton is putting in enormous work and time on the inquiry. My view is that the strategy jointly adopted on this matter will prove to be extremely useful, although it may not solve everything.</P>
      <P>I met the relatives of Mr. Séamus Ludlow some time ago. Deputies will be aware I previously stated that the Government had accepted the Victims Commission's recommendation in the Séamus Ludlow case, but that consultations were to take place. The relatives have strong views and they are not yet satisfied that this is the best way to proceed. However, I remain strongly of the view that an examination of the case by the former Chief Justice is the best way forward and I continue to try to urge them in that regard.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn is aware, there are difficulties in the Séamus Ludlow case, including cross-jurisdictional issues. An added complication is that identifiable individuals were accused publicly in the case and the DPP in Northern Ireland, having considered evidence available there, decided not to prefer charges. This will make a public examination of the case difficult here. However, my view remains that an examination by the former Chief Justice is the best way to proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 28, 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The most recently published inflation figures for Ireland which relate to April show a year-on-year increase of 4.9% in the consumer price index &ndash; CPI &ndash; and a 5% increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices &ndash; HICP. The EU HICP for the same period was 1.7% and it was 1.9% for the 11 countries involved in the euro. As Deputies are aware, this increase is due to a number of factors, including the sharp increase in oil prices, the fall in the value of the euro, the budget increase in excise duty on tobacco and an increase in underlying domestic inflation. The impact of higher energy prices in particular has been significant. Crude oil prices increased from a low of $11 per barrel in March 1999 to a peak in March this year of over $30 per barrel. It is estimated that this has added close to 1.5% to the CPI. The fall in the value of the euro has also added to inflationary pressures. The increase in excise duties for health reasons on tobacco has also added about 0.75% to the CPI and this will pass out of the index by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus a large part of the recent increase in inflation reflects exceptional factors. These factors will become less significant over time and, <Col N="968" /> as a consequence, it is expected that inflation will fall in the second half of this year. The extent of this fall will depend on the value of the euro and future oil price developments.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this uncertainty, it is now clear that inflation will be higher than the 3% average for the year which was forecast on budget day. A revised forecast will be published as usual by my Department in the economic review and outlook in July-August. It is now expected that inflation will average in the order of 4% for the year as a whole, though the rate will be less than this at the end of December. This is higher than was expected when the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness were being negotiated. However, this agreement is for three years, and I am confident that, over the remaining period of the agreement, inflation will fall well below current levels. In this context, the appropriate policy response is to fully implement the terms of the PPF. I am confident the agreed pay increases combined with promised tax reductions will provide for continued gains in real disposable incomes.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view that unsustainable wage and price developments would threaten our economic prosperity. Our objective is to ensure that the increase in inflation does not become entrenched and that the concerns about overheating, which I share with Commissioner Solbes, are addressed. This means the terms of the PPF must be strictly adhered to. This is the best way of sustaining the economic and social progress we have achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has informed us that the annual rate of inflation in Ireland is now 5% but that of the European Union is 1.7% on average, which is significantly less than half the Irish rate. However, in his explanation, he attributes our increased rate to the increase in oil prices from $11 to $30 a barrel and the fall in the euro. Is the Minister suggesting ours was the only country in Europe which experienced an increase in oil prices and that it is the only one experiencing a declining euro? Otherwise, his explanation is nonsense because it does not explain the difference between Irish inflation at 5% and European Union average inflation at 1.7%. His explanation applies equally to all European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just I who gives this analysis and explanation of the consumer price index. Independent assessment of the CPI, which is available to people, will prove the points I made. I have not just made this up. This is as a result of analysis of the consumer price index and underlying data. Everyone is agreed that such data show that 1.5% of the rate relates to higher energy prices which have been caused by factors I have just outlined. Another 0.75% relates to the 50p on the packet of cigarettes which I imposed in the budget. There is an indication of inflation in the domestic services area, and analysis of figures will demonstrate the points I have just made. <Col N="969" /> They are not just made up for the purposes of my giving an answer to the House. That is what independent analysis of the figures proves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that they are not made up, but I asked the Minister to explain why the same level of oil price increases across Europe and the same level of decline in the value of euro across the 11 euroland countries has not resulted in similar inflation in other jurisdictions. Their average is 1.7%; our annual rate is 5%. Can the Minister explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just explained it. People have analysed these figures and they have been subject to a great deal of analysis. It should also be remembered that, in a small, open economy such as Ireland's, it was agreed before we ever joined the euro that one of the main determinants of Irish inflation was the rate of the Irish pound as against other currencies. Before we joined the euro, it was primarily against sterling, and it has been against sterling and the dollar since we joined it. As of 1 January 1999 when we joined, the euro stood at about 1.16 to 1.17 to the dollar. Last week it was about 88c to 89c to the dollar, which is a considerable decrease in its value. The fall in the exchange rate against sterling has been just as dramatic. We also have the highest ratio of imports of any European countries. Consequently, the exchange rate is a key determinant in Irish inflation, and this was agreed by all long before my time as Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that many workers who signed up to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on the basis of a prediction of 3% inflation for this year now feel they have been conned since it is clear they will be less well-off in real terms at the end of the year than they were at the beginning? Will the Minister indicate if he intends to take any measures to reduce the headline rate of inflation between now and the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The PPF is an agreement over the best part of three years. Previous agreements which we concluded were for three to four years and were predicated on certain inflation figures. As I said in my reply and in interviews, wage increases together with tax reductions over the lifetime of the agreement will ensure that workers do well. One way inflation would be set off is if people seek compensatory wage increases on account of a temporary blip in inflation. I recall that, during January, February and March of 1998, there were considerable headlines due to the weakness of the Irish pound at that stage as against sterling which it was suggested could set off an inflationary spiral, but that did not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is a cornerstone of recent economic success. It is also a cornerstone in restraining inflation and maintaining our competitiveness. Some trade unionists were against the concept of social part<Col N="970" /> nership and have taken every opportunity in the run-up to the signing of the agreement and since then to denigrate the basis of the agreement. However, I do not subscribe to their views and, as evidenced by the margin of the vote in favour of &ndash; 69% to 31% &ndash; neither do the vast majority of trade unionists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that a 5% headline rate of inflation undermines a wage agreement where the first annual instalment is a 5.5% increase which is subject to income tax? Does he appreciate that the net gain from the increase will be less than the annual inflation figure? In that context, does he have any proposals to bring forward to reduce the headline rate of inflation so that the current wage agreement may be secured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to make economic decisions based on short-term considerations and make an effort to temporarily reduce headline inflation, that would be the worst possible medicine and most people would agree with me on that. The wage increases under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the proposed tax reductions will give all workers in the State considerable advantages and an increase in their real standard of living in coming years, something previous programmes also did. I am confident the basis on which the programme was constructed and what will happen over the lifetime of the programme will mean everyone will be considerably better-off. It behoves everyone in politics, be they in Government or in Opposition, to encourage people in the trade union movement. People in other areas have said we should take a balanced view of how this will progress. We have seen over the past 12 years the benefits of social consensus and the partnership approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Minister has no proposal to combat inflation? In his initial reply he said that 0.8% of the 5% inflation rate was due to the increase in excise duty on tobacco on budget day. Does he agree that this increase in excise duty on tobacco has nothing to do with the fundamentals of the economy, that it is an arbitrary decision made by the Government, that it is artificial, that it has nothing to do with the fundamentals of economic management and that he would be justified in reducing excise duty elsewhere by a similar amount? I accept it would be tinkering with the headline rate and would be an artificial reduction. However, the increase is artificial and arbitrary in any event and has nothing to do with the fundamentals of the economy. Why not reduce the excise duty on petroleum products by an equivalent percentage? It would place the wage agreement at less risk than it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a good case, although I doubt if he intended to do so, that the <Col N="971" /> price of tobacco products should not be included in the consumer price index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have a consumer price index which does not include the price of tobacco products or mortgage interest but trade unionists and everyone else want to measure it on the CPI. I am sure the Deputy would agree, as a former Minister for Health, that there are good policy considerations for increasing the price of cigarettes by 50p.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right that increasing cigarettes by 20p, 50p or £1 has nothing to do with economic fundamentals. The question relates to the consumer price index as measured and that includes the price of cigarettes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. The trade union movement signed up to PPF on that basis. As I said on previous occasions when discussing former agreements, this is not a one way process. It is not only the Government which must live up to its terms of the bargain but everyone else must do so as well. The trade union movement signed up to PPF by a percentage of 69% to 31%.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy it is not the Government's intention to go outside the terms of the PPF for any group. Difficulties have been caused in public sector pay in the past 12 years as a result of dealing with special groups and this has led to knock-on claims in other areas. As the Deputy knows, a benchmarking body will be set up during the lifetime of the agreement. That was the agreed solution between the Government and the trade union movement on how to address problems and relativities in the future. I urgently request all groups with a gripe about any matter to look at what will happen in the benchmarking body. The Government will not step outside the terms of the PPF for any group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's apparent complacency in face of the increase in the inflation <Col N="972" /> rate is causing considerable concern. He accepts that his Department's forecast of 3% at budget time was wide of the mark, yet he tells us he does not intend to issue a further official forecast until the mid-summer essay which his Department regularly publishes. On what basis is he asserting that the inflation rate will come down between now and the end of the year? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Ad hoc</i> economic policy is the worst policy of all. If I made immediate responses to every economic change, I would have made crazy decisions over the past three years. The figure we announced at budget time was the Department's best estimate of what inflation would be for 2000 and it was more or less in line with what was said by the ESRI and the Central Bank. As is the custom, we review our economic forecast in July and August of each year and I intend to keep that format.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the inflation figures for the months of January, February, March and April that the average for the year will be 4%, unless something dramatic happens in the second half of the year. However, the figure for year on year at the end of December will be less because tobacco, for example, will fall out of the equation. All this is predicated on what will happen to the price of oil and the value of the euro <i>vis-à-vis</i> other currencies and a guesstimate of what will happen to ECB interest rates. As ECB interest rates increase to cool Europe's economy, it has a knock-on effect here in that it affects mortgage interest rates which are included in the consumer price index. As with tobacco, a case could be made for not including mortgage interest rates in the consumer price index. We will take those things into account in the July and August forecast and we will make our usual estimate at that time.</P>

      <P>The Minister replied to four questions, including Question No. 27, but he did not address the issue in that question. The Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr. Pedro Solbes, pointed out that our economy is overheating and that the Government should consider steps to reduce the rate of inflation. What steps does the Minister think he had in mind or will he bother to inquire from the other illustrious communist in charge of this portfolio in Europe? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not asked Commissioner Solbes what he has in mind but I have a fair idea of what economic commentators, including Commissioner Solbes, have in mind when they talk about taking steps to bring down inflation; they are talking about reducing demand in the economy. There are a few steps one could take to reduce demand in the economy but they are not feasible or practical and they would not have any effect.</P>
      <P>In an open economy, such as Germany, France or the United Kingdom, the normal economic textbook applies. However, one would have to take a lot of demand out of our economy to have any effect on inflation. I am talking about a couple of billion, not a couple of million pounds. Do the Deputy and those who advocate taking other steps to reduce inflation want me to telephone the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and ask them to give me back £1 billion which we are providing for the health service and social welfare increases, or to say to the trade union movement, with which we recently concluded a deal for the next two years, that I will not give tax reductions but that I will impose tax increases? That is the traditional economic response of policy makers throughout Europe when dealing with economies.</P>
      <P>I and others have been at pains over the past two years &ndash; many people agree with me &ndash; to point out that the rules about inflation do not necessarily apply to our economy because it is small and open. That is why I disagree with outside commentators who apply the normal textbook rules of economic theory to Ireland. An analysis of the past 25 years will show that. The measures I outlined are what would be needed to have any marginal effect on inflation and no one is suggesting we should do that.</P>

I accept this is not included in the consumer price index but everyone must realise it is proceeding apace. We have already had two Bacon reports, both of which were implemented and failed. Does the Minister propose to take further steps to stabilise the price of houses and to make them affordable to the many young couples, particularly those who live in Dublin who are in absolute despair with regard to their ability to purchase family homes?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan's assertion that the escalating cost of houses is a matter of grave concern. The Government shares his concern about the increase in house prices. When the first Bacon report was received, I introduced the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, which temporarily distorted demand. I recall stating at the time that it would have such an effect in the short-term and that we would be obliged to increase supply in the long-term.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan will be aware that I, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, have provided a great deal of money serviced land initiatives, major water and sewerage schemes, road access schemes and additional resources for An Bord Pleanála and local authority planning departments to increase supply. He will also be aware that Mr. Bacon will submit a further report on housing to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the near future.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the reduction in the CPI which would result from a reduction of 2% in the standard rate of VAT; the consideration, if any, he has made to a reduction in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14314/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that a 2% reduction in the standard rate of VAT, if fully passed on in retail prices, would reduce the consumer price index by 0.8%. Such a reduction would cost in the order of £370 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I considered all relevant options in relation to indirect taxation before the last budget, including the option of changes in VAT rates and I will examine these options further in the run up to the next budget. I am not convinced that cutting VAT is the appropriate strategy for combating inflation. My priority has been to cut direct tax rates to encourage the supply of labour, capital and enterprise and in this way expand the productive base of the economy and our ability to meet the demand side pressure on resources on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister appear to imply that a reduction in the rate of VAT might not be passed on in the form of lower prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the run-up to any budget I would consider changes to all forms of taxation, including indirect taxation. It was suggested that consideration should have been given to reducing the rate of VAT by 1% in the last budget &ndash; Deputy Noonan may have made the suggestion &ndash; to compensate for increases in the price of tobacco and other products.</P>
      <P>It is my view that in buoyant economic conditions when people have a great deal of disposable income, retailers would be tempted to retain the profits from a 1% reduction in the rate of VAT. Given that the market is so buoyant, customers are not necessarily as price sensitive as they would be if the economic situation was different. Furthermore, some of those who advocate reductions in excise and VAT rates as a solution to inflation also state that there is too much demand in the economy. Reducing the rate of VAT or excise duties, which leads to increased demand in the economy, would have no effect other than creating a distorted blip on the CPI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not stating that I will not consider these areas in the run-up to the budget in December. <Col N="976" /> However, I find it difficult to believe that in times of buoyant economic conditions it would be appropriate to reduce the rate of VAT to reduce the consumer price index. These matters will be considered before the introduction of the budget. I am merely laying down my markers at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to lay down a marker. In <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> last weekend, anonymous officials, I presume attached to the Minister's Department, were quoted as being critical of the Opposition. Is it a new departure that unnamed civil servants should become involved in what is essentially a political debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be extremely concerned if a civil servant in my Department had spoken to a media correspondent about such matters. I have no evidence that any person did so. I am aware of the article to which the Deputy refers but I did not read it because there were many other articles in last Sunday's newspapers which occupied my attention. I agree with Deputy Noonan that it is not the job of civil servants, regardless of who is in Government, to criticise proposals offered by Opposition Members. I am satisfied that no civil servant in my Department would ever do so. No one contacted my Department about the article in question, but if the Deputy can supply evidence to the contrary I will examine it. I take a very dim view of such behaviour because it is not the responsibility of civil servants to criticise proposals from any side of the House, regardless of how they feel about them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 34 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I am currently engaged in a series of meetings with my ministerial colleagues with a view to bringing proposals on a new programme of decentralisation before the Government shortly. I intend that the Government will be in a position to take decisions on the new programme within the next number of months. Until such time as the Government has fully considered all of the issues relating to the new programme I am not in a position to comment on the likelihood of any particular centre featuring in the programme.</P>
      <P>The issue of decentralisation has been raised by the Civil Service unions at the general council and my Department has consistently assured the unions that they will be consulted at the appropriate time. In the meantime I can confirm that I have no intention of departing from the long standing voluntary nature of decentralisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The towns and cities included in the current programme were selected by the Government having regard to the desire to promote regional development, economic growth and a more even spread of public service jobs throughout the country. I refer here to the current Administration and its predecessor. These criteria are as applicable today and they will be among those used to select the centres for the forthcoming programme. The Government is also conscious of the other issues which are likely to impact on the success of the programme. These could include proximity to third level institutions, convenient access to Dublin, the scale of the offices being decentralised, the availability of services, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to use decentralisation as a vehicle to address job losses in particular areas of the country. Some of the criteria involved in choosing a location may be in conflict. <Col N="978" /> For example, when the Government considers the centres in which decentralisation has already occurred it will have to decide, in the interests of a greater spread of services, whether these centres should be ruled out for further decentralisation or whether a synergy could be achieved with existing offices on an economy of scale by adding to existing facilities. Having heard all of the issues which must be considered, Deputies will appreciate how difficult it is for me to provide a simple list of criteria against which potential centres for decentralised offices can be measured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am currently engaged in consultations with my ministerial colleagues. I do not expect sections of Departments or Ministers to issue notes stating that their Departments wish to be decentralised to a particular part of Ireland. I am currently engaged in a process of consultation on that issue. I intend to meet the Civil Service unions in this regard at the appropriate stage. I do not have any intention of excluding the unions from the process and the only reason they have not been consulted to date is that I have not been in a position to bring any proposals to them for discussion. Decentralisation will be carried out on a voluntary basis on the part of the civil and public servants involved, as has happened previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience has shown that civil servants are delighted to be transferred down the country and that they wonder why they ever spent time in Dublin. I was interested to note the Minister's comment that he wanted to spread public service jobs evenly throughout the country. Waterford has the highest unemployment rate in the country, particularly in the administrative field, according to figures published by the Central Statistics Office. I hope the Minister will take that into account when he considers the distribution of these decentralised jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, I have received representations from more than 90 cities, towns and villages which are interested in hosting decentralised Government offices. The Deputy is undoubtedly aware that west Wicklow and Kildare have always been regarded as a natural hinterland of Dublin and I would have to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>The current programme of decentralisation has been ongoing for some time and when it is completed &ndash; I hope by the end of next year &ndash; it is hoped that in the region of 14,000 civil servants will be located outside Dublin. It is my intention that the programme which is due to be announced will result in a further 10,000 public servants being located outside Dublin. There are approximately 32,000 civil and public servants in total, breaking down as 29,500 civil servants and 2,500 public servants. We hope the impending round of decentralisation will result in 24,000 civil and public servants being located outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>In the light of increased technology, there is no need to have everyone centred in Dublin. People are conducting businesses all over the globe. Some major multinational firms are working on huge projects, such as building skyscrapers and bridges, by sending drawings etc. over the Internet. That is happening all over the world. It might have been necessary to have had everyone centred in Dublin 40 years ago but that is no longer the case. Deputy Deasy stated that those who have been decentralised wonder afterwards what all the fuss was about and why they did not move out of Dublin years earlier.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that a large number of civil servants has sought transfers out of Dublin. At one stage, some 200 or 300 people from County Clare were actively seeking transfers. People should be facilitated to work in their own areas. The Minister will be aware of the case which has been made for extreme areas in the west such as Kilrush and of the necessity to take some initiatives there. Decentralisation has had a major economic impact on Ennis and the surrounding area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>A later parliamentary question on transfers to County Louth and County Meath reveals that the number of people seeking transfers from two Departments is very high. That reply may provide Deputies with some idea of the <Col N="980" /> numbers of people wishing to return to particular localities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly has made the case for County Clare on many occasions and has pointed out the benefits of decentralisation to Ennis. Perhaps a proportionate benefit could be bestowed on the less populated parts of County Clare. I am sure that Deputy is not advocating that 2,000 civil servants should roll in to a particular part of west Clare.</P>
      <P>There are many issues to be considered in regard to decentralisation such as the availability of housing, water and sewerage services etc. I usually find that when one makes a decision, these things follow. Entrepreneurs take the initiative to provide these services and thereby create economic activity in parts of the country which never previously experienced such activity. People have made the case for their own areas but some 99% of them will be disappointed and there will be hell to pay. There is a political downside to this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The decentralisation programme tends to focus solely on Dublin. However, it could be applied in other cities. In Limerick city, for example, there are 200 people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development office but there is only one part-time person in the office in Newcastle West even though the town is at the centre of the agricultural hinterland. People who must travel to Limerick cannot get parking in the office car park and are often obliged to pay parking fines. Will <Col N="981" /> the Minister consider decentralisation in that situation rather than focusing only on Dublin?</P>
    <P>There might be merit in decentralisation from cities such as Limerick to towns such as Newcastle West. Staff might be able to buy a home for £10,000 less than in the city and their offices would be closer to the marketplace they should be servicing.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised this point. It was also raised in recent discussions in the Department and is now under consideration &ndash; not the situation in County Limerick but the general principle outlined by the Deputy. Decentralisation has resulted in a considerable number of offices being moved to a particular area and there could be further decentralisation from that area. A large number of people were decentralised to one part of the country over the past ten years and there might now be a need to move them further from that area, in line with what the Deputy proposes. The office in Limerick to which the Deputy referred was not under consideration but I support the general principle. One could call it sub-decentralisation.</P>

      <P>This working group has not yet been set up but it will be established before July 2000. The precise mechanism for carrying out the review of the tax treatment of work related expenses has not, as yet, been determined. I expect discussions to take place shortly between the appropriate parties, including the Revenue Commissioners, the ICTU and IBEC to establish the appropriate review mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Which work related expenses does the Minister expect to be the subject of the review? Does he expect trade union membership fees to be considered in the review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>That area will probably be examined by the group. The concerns of the ICTU appear to relate to matters such as the treatment of expenses for travelling to work, including, in one case, the payment of ferry charges, the treatment of expenses for workers who must be on call and benefit-in-kind issues where workers have the use of vans overnight. The IBEC did not raise any matter in this area during the partnership talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that expenses which should be allowed for working people has concentrated the minds of tax advisers for many years. There is a fundamental difference between what is allowed to a self-employed person and a <Col N="982" /> person in employment. If I remember my tax law correctly, it means that in the case of a self-employed person the expense must fall in the category that it is wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred for the business, whereas in the case of a person in employment the expense must necessarily be incurred in the performance of the employment.</P>
    <P>The definitive case in this area was in 1932 or 1933, where a teacher claimed the expense of the cost of his horse travelling to and from the school. The teacher correctly claimed that he could not get to the school without a horse or a bicycle &ndash; I forget whether it was a horse or a bicycle. The judgment was that he could not claim it because he did not require the horse or bicycle in the performance of his duties, which was teaching. However, there is a different rule for a self-employed person who needs his van or vehicle for the purposes of his trade. That is the underlying difference which has remained in the tax code for many years.</P>
    <P>The working group will probably examine this and other issues. It is a difficult area and it will be difficult to arrive at a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>With the changeover to a tax credit system, does the Minister envisage that expenses actually incurred will continue to be allowed as deductible at their full value from the amount of taxable income or will it be convertible in some way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years in the PAYE tax code a number of understandings and agreements were arrived at between categories of workers and the Revenue Commissioners to allow a flat rate expense deduction. That has always been allowed at the taxpayer's marginal rate and I would prefer that system to continue.</P>

The group has not completed its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Oral submissions were heard by the group in early May and an advertisement was placed in the press seeking written submissions from interested parties. The closing date for receipt of those submissions is Friday, 26 May. While I have no definite date for completion of the report, I hope the receipt of the submissions will facilitate the group <Col N="983" /> in its deliberations and in early finalisation.

      <P>The group is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is intended that when the report is completed it will be published as soon as possible after the Government has considered it. Deputy Deenihan has been steadfast in pursuing this matter but, as I pointed out on many occasions, this is a difficult area because the scheme is extremely generous. I do not wish to have to differentiate between one form of disability and another. Each disability is a serious matter for the person who suffers from it. However, the cost of this scheme is so generous that one must take a rounded view.</P>
      <P>Thousands of people suffer some form of disability. The purpose of the scheme is to cater for persons who are severely and permanently incapacitated with regard to physical mobility. I recall the furore that ensued some years ago when it was proposed to make changes to the scheme. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will also remember it because he was the Minister for Health at the time.</P>
      <P>The group is examining all relevant issues and when its report has been considered by the Government it will be published.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that unless two similar limbs are affected &ndash; two hands or two legs &ndash; a person will not qualify for the scheme? Stroke victims whose arm and leg might be disabled do not qualify. I am seeking a small extension of the scheme to include these people. It is a generous scheme for the people who qualify but it is most unfair for those who should qualify but do not. The Minister should look at cases which do not qualify for the scheme. There might not be many and the scheme is most unfair to them.</P>

      <P>The issue of the primary medical certificate is a matter for the area medical officer and is something over which the Minister for Finance does not have control. An examination of the parliamentary questions, particularly those submitted to my office for written answer, in recent years would show that there have been more questions on this than on anything else. It would not be appropriate to comment further on the scheme and on the criteria while the policy <Col N="984" /> review group is looking at the matter. Deputies have shown me examples of people who have not qualified and there are people I know who have not qualified, but all this is being examined by the review group in the total context. It would not be appropriate to comment on one form of disability as against another while the review group is examining this entire area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly points out that he has answered questions on this issue at virtually every session of Question Time in the past year.

      <P>The review group is set up under the auspices of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, and the official chairing it is from her Department. This is an interdepartmental group and it has advertised for submissions. I hope we will receive the report by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>It is not that the question is too difficult to handle. The difficulty is to handle the question even-handedly and, for example, not differentiate in favour of one form of disability as against another. This is what this group is working on.</P>
      <P>My Department made submissions to the group, but I will not give commitments at this stage without examining the group's report.

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the reason his estimate of the year on year increase in tax receipts was 8.6% on budget day while the actual return for the first quarter shows an increase of 16.7%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14212/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The year on year increase in taxes for 2000 over 1999 projected on budget day, 1 December 1999, was 9.6%. This was based on a projected outturn for tax receipts of £18,384 million in 1999. The actual 1999 outturn was £18,559 million which had the effect of reducing the 2000 budget day tax forecast increase from 9.6% to 8.6%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer returns showed that tax receipts by end March were 16.7% higher than in <Col N="985" /> the same period last year. By end April the increase in tax receipts over the same period last year had fallen to 14.7%. Deputies will be aware that these figures do not reflect the impact of the personal tax package which took effect from 6 April. That will begin to be reflected in the receipts from May onwards, and will tend to further reduce the rate of increase over the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>The rate of increase in taxes is mainly determined by the rate of economic growth in the economy. The budget day projection for tax receipts was based on a forecast of GDP growth of 7.4% in 2000 and it now seems likely that GDP growth will be even stronger than expected on budget day. The Department is currently reviewing its forecasts and its updated assessment will be published in the Economic Review and Outlook in July. At this stage, it appears likely that tax revenue for the year as a whole could exceed the budget target by around £500 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that what is wrong here is not just that the estimate is wrong but that the method is wrong, and that his Department has been aware of this for some time but yet does not seem to have changed the method? Some time ago I had a lengthy conversation with an official in his Department who spoke to me with great expertise about the issue. I understood the Department is reconsidering how it does this work, but yet it does not seem to have made a decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Any surplus over and above what I anticipated on budget day will be used to further reduce the national debt. Perhaps some extra moneys could be put aside for the pension fund proposal. Any surplus will be used for either of those purposes.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised a good point, one which was raised not only by him and others but inside the Government. Two years ago we analysed this matter and revised the method of doing this. I will get my Department to send the Deputy a copy of our proposals. There was a new methodology used in the past two budgets. The first time we used this methodology, most commentators said after the budget that whatever about previous forecasts, this was really at the outer limit and it might be a little dangerous because it might have been understated.</P>
      <P>There is an interesting international phenomenon about this. In times of economic upsurge every country we examined understated the tax revenues and, peculiarly enough, in times of economic downturn they all overstated the forecast. Therefore, this is not a phenomenon which is unique to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have revised the methodology and I can <Col N="986" /> give the Deputy the document regarding the methodology involved. The first year we did it there was considerable angst that we might be going a little too far.</P>
    <P>If one thinks that is a little unusual in Ireland, in the UK the forecast for overall tax revenue on budget day in 1999 was £322 billion for the 1999-2000 tax year. A few months before the end of the year they were proposing an overall exchequer deficit &ndash; they do not use those phrases there, but the effect is the same. The overall surplus for the year turned out to be £12 billion. In case people might think that the situation is a little unusual here, we have never been that far out compared to the UK. I point that out for the benefit not only of the Opposition but perhaps of some of my colleagues also.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have received an extensive brief on this. The Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon was scheduled to be completed by 7 July. It began on 22 May but it appears from the last report I received &ndash; I have received a number in the past 24 hours &ndash; that it is likely to be completed in a matter of days, and perhaps hours. Reports received overnight and during the day <Col N="993" /> from New York and the embassy in Washington have provided me with all the details on that. From what I have heard before attending the House, reports may already have been overtaken by events. A statement will be issued later today, if it has not already been issued, by the President of the UN Security Council, which is China at present. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations will brief UNIFIL troops later. The contributing countries will also be briefed in New York. Ireland will be represented at that meeting.</P>
      <P>There has also been a request that additional troops would be considered necessary by the UNIFIL group. The Government discussed that matter today and will have to give it consideration. The Department of Defence had anticipated dealing with that matter before 30 May. I have received an extensive brief which I will ask one of the Ministers, if the Deputy is interested, to examine. It is the details from China to the UN.</P>

Is the Taoiseach satisfied there are adequate logistical arrangements in place in the eastern Mediterranean to protect UN forces in light of the military vacuum now being created in southern Lebanon, which could prove extremely dangerous to UN forces in that area? Will the Taoiseach engage in consultations today with all those who might be in a position to provide air support and whatever other support is necessary to protect UN forces in that theatre?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will now discuss item No. 15, motion <i>re.</i> report of the Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann. I call on Deputy Tony Killeen, chairman of the <Col N="995" /> Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann. The speech of the chairman and of the members of the committee for the Fine Gael and Labour parties shall not exceed five minutes in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, having regard to the report of the Committee on Members' Interests of the results of an investigation into a complaint concerning Deputy Denis Foley, which report was laid before Dáil Éireann on 18 May, 2000 and, in particular, having regard to the findings and determinations of the committee contained in that report, Deputy Denis Foley be suspended from the service of the House for the period of 14 days on which the House shall sit and that the period of that suspension shall commence forthwith.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Members' Interests undertook a very difficult task in considering this matter and preparing the report. I confess to being somewhat surprised at the clamour for a debate, particularly emanating from sources, parties, individuals and groups who would have had an opportunity to have membership of the committee at the outset of the 28th Dáil, had they so chosen. My colleague members of the committee did not come under any pressure to have themselves replaced as members of the committee while this difficult task was under way.</P>
      <P>I thank the committee members for the manner in which they undertook the very difficult task. I also thank the clerk of the committee, the other staff members and the legal team for their advice and support. It is important that the divisions throughout the report were unanimous and that reflects the level of co-operation and the understanding of the task taken by all the members.</P>
      <P>The principle at stake is that of self-regulation by this House of the Oireachtas and whether it has the capacity to undertake such an inquiry. Many of us would have harboured doubts about whether that was possible. Since there is a relatively small membership, Members clearly know each other and it is very difficult to take legislation and make judgments on a colleague in the manner required by the Act. I am satisfied my colleagues and I undertook that fairly and with due process.</P>
      <P>A 30 page report has been prepared which has been circulated and addresses all the relevant aspects of the case. I could not go into all the detail in the five minutes available to me. I urge any person with an interest in the case or who comments on it in public to read the report. There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest that some commentators, sadly including some Oireachtas Members, have commented on the case without either having read the Act or the report. That is regrettable and there is not much excuse for it since the report is very clear and available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> The case has been made very strongly that the level of suspension proposed is lenient and, in some cases, it is considered ridiculously lenient. It is clear that people who make that case do not understand that the committee had three major options available to it, noting the complaint, mere censure or a suspension ranging from naught to 30 days. In that context, much of the comment must be considered ill-founded and ill-informed. Also on this occasion, since it was the first complaint under the Act, the committee was faced in effect with conducting two processes, consideration of the individual case and establishing a precedent and a procedure for any future cases which may arise. One fervently hopes that does not happen.</P>
    <P>It is also clear to any person who has given the matter consideration that the only matter which the committee was empowered to consider was the breach of the Act which had been alleged. There are other matters to do with Ansbacher accounts, membership of other committees of the House and so on which are thrown into the pot with every comment on the determination of the committee, which were entirely irrelevant to the consideration of this matter.</P>
    <P>It is important when a committee of the House sets out on a job such as this that it would do so having due regard to natural and constitutional justice. That was done. The committee set out to act reasonably and in an impartial and unbiased manner. Furthermore, to be seen to act reasonably, fairly and impartially, the committee was required to apprise Deputy Foley of all the information in his possession whether favourable to him or otherwise. It was a requirement that the committee observe the statutory requirements laid down by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. It was a requirement in constitutional and natural justice that Deputy Foley be allowed to represent his case in the best possible light and that the committee conduct its proceedings, procedures and adjudications in accordance with the principles of justice. The committee has done that.</P>
    <P>I am not so naive as to think any determination of the committee would meet with acclaim, welcome and agreement inside or outside the House. While it is fair to take account of the points made by the committee on pages 29 and 30 of the report, anyone who has a genuine interest in the matter will consider a great deal more. It is fair to ask that that be done.</P>
    <P>It is also fair that Members consider the provisions of sections 5 and 7 of the Act. Many of us have not done so. Those who are not members of the committee have a relatively poor understanding of the detail of the Act. If that is the case it is incumbent on them to rectify this shortcoming.</P>
    <P>The determination was made under section 10 of the Act and is set out clearly under four headings which are dealt with in the report in considerable detail, with clarity and fair play to all concerned. I commend the report to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the first test of the Ethics in Public Office Act. The proceedings were conducted in a non-political, non-partisan way. This is a tribute to the chairman, Deputy Killeen, a member of Fianna Fáil, and my colleagues on the committee.</P>
      <P>As this was the first charge of its kind under the Act and the committee was embarking on new territory, it had to draw up new procedures. It had to draw up a statement of contravention, work out how this was to be served and allow an opportunity to respond. It also had to draw up a memorandum of proceedings in case the matter went to public hearings. Ultimately, after about 13 meetings, it reached the stage where in natural justice it had to present the draft memorandum of proceedings to the respondent, Deputy Foley, to allow him an opportunity to make a submission on the fairness of those proceedings.</P>
      <P>That was the background to the decision. During the course of discussions and submissions on the memorandum of proceedings an indication was given by Deputy Foley that he would enter a guilty plea. It was the committee's job to make certain findings under the Act, whether the charge was major or minor and whether in the commission of the offence Deputy Foley was negligent, reckless or otherwise. This led to the report before the House.</P>
      <P>I am glad the report, the first of its kind under the Act, has been the subject of much comment. This discussion is useful. As the chairman mentioned, it would be helpful if those who wish to comment read the report first. It would also be helpful if they read the provisions of the Act on which the report is based.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of defending the report. Everybody did the best they could and produced what they considered to be a fair report. It is important to state that the committee was not involved in penalising Deputy Foley in relation to his Ansbacher account or in any criminal or revenue matter arising therefrom. The statement of contravention related solely to non-declaration at the time a vote was taken in the House.</P>
      <P>In determining the penalty account was taken of the fact that the respondent had co-operated with the committee and did not seek to prolong or obstruct the investigation or to challenge evidence to be given to the committee. Account was also taken of the fact that other more serious charges could be made. The committee looked at the situation in other jurisdictions. Members will recall the cash for questions issue dealt with by a similar committee in the United Kingdom. The committee also took account of the fact that no tangible benefit was conferred on Deputy Foley as a result of the defeat of the amendment in which he participated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of issues which need to be borne in mind for the future. As the chairman mentioned, there is a range of penalties. Any penalty for a Member is serious in the sense that it is a decision of his or her peers to censure him or her in one way or other. Account has also to be <Col N="998" /> taken of the fact that for the future Members of this or our sister House will not be in a position to state in defence that they were merely following the party whip. If there is any question of a material interest, it is the responsibility of the Member concerned to declare it. This debate is useful in that it brings home that obligation to Members.</P>
    <P>The report has been subject to criticism. If there is a need to review the operation of the Act &ndash; this was the first case of its kind &ndash; let us have an informed debate and let us look at what is happening in other jurisdictions. Given all the allegations that have been made, is the Act sufficient to deal with all difficulties being encountered in the body politic? Pending such a review, the decision of the committee, with which I fully agree &ndash; it was a unanimous decision &ndash; was made within the confines of the existing Act. On that basis I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the resolution and the unanimous view of the committee on the matter before the House. Article 15.10 of the Constitution states that each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders with power to attach penalties for their infringement. Apart from issues of order, in which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is particularly interested, codes of conduct were never properly explored. The provisions of Article 15 of the Constitution were never fully seized to lay down rules of behaviour and mechanisms to enforce them in the House. The Ethics in Public Office Act was the first major attempt to do so.</P>
      <P>Before the Committee on Members' Interests was a charge that a Member of the House had breached section 7 of the Ethics in Public Office Act. It was a narrow issue, that a Member voted on a matter in which he had a material interest without making a declaration to this effect. That was all the committee could look into. All the other matters written about in recent days were not part of the discussions or focus of the committee. If Deputy Foley had informed the Clerk of the House or made a statement that he had an interest in the issue, that would have fulfilled his obligations under the Act and there would have been no investigation and no penalty.</P>
      <P>The penalties available to the committee are laid down in law. Section 28 of the Act contains a graduated scale of penalties. Where there is discerned breach of the Act, a report noting that breach is placed before the House. For more serious offences the House may be called on to censure the Member concerned. For the most serious breaches, suspension may be recommended. It was in this latter category that the committee placed the breach in question, the subject of the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice available to the framers of the original Act was that it was not possible to impose a monetary penalty, in other words, to debar a Member from receiving his or her salary during a period of suspension, as this would trespass on <Col N="999" /> the rights of the courts to impose penalties. I disagree with this view. It is an issue which we will have to revisit. Article 15 of the Constitution makes it clear that the House can make its own rules and regulations. Under the rules available to the House of Commons and the United States Congress in Washington, a Member can be debarred or thrown out for serious misconduct. This area has to be revisited now. Many people have described the Act as cautious and I agree, but it is a monumental first step. We need to revisit the range of issues about which Members and the public could complain so there is a clear code of conduct understood by Members and the public. We also have to revisit the penalties appropriate to offences committed. The House must take notice of the timidity which can rightly be levelled against the Act in the context of revisiting ethics standards currently afoot. I assure the House that the Labour Party will play a full part in that process as it did when framing the original legislation when we sought to establish codes of conduct enforceable by law.</P>
    <P>In essence, the report and the motion are small but highly significant first steps. For the first time, this House has set out in statute, standards of behaviour which must be complied with. It has also set up a process of investigation and those who read the report will have some understanding of the way in which the investigation was carried out. I concur with my Fine Gael colleague that this was done in a totally non-partisan, non-political manner and I heartily commend the chairman, Deputy Killeen, for his outstanding role in ensuring that scrupulous standards were maintained during the process.</P>
    <P>It was explained to us that the process would be the model for the future and that we could not make mistakes. Natural and constitutional justice were complied with to the nth degree. A sanctions regime is available to the House. Many people spoke of slaps on the wrist or inadequate penalties but it was the statutory range of penalties decided upon by the Oireachtas. It is time to revisit these penalties. This was the range of penalties available to the committee and an unbiased observer with full knowledge of all the facts would accept that the committee's decision was a fair determination. While the committee hopes it will not be faced with many investigations, Members know that mechanisms are in place by which the standards of this House and public life can be vindicated.</P>

    <Title>Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this landmark legislation before the House. The Internet has been likened by some to a juggernaut of change speeding towards every organisation and the Government is determined not to be caught in its headlights. The Internet revolution will bring significant opportunities and the leaders of tomorrow are those who seize those opportunities. In past decades Ireland has excelled in implementing strategies to take advantage of niche opportunities in areas such as pharmaceuticals, teleservices and software development. However, the e-commerce opportunity is far larger than any of these and that is why it is so important that we get the strategy right from day one.</P>
      <P>In a very short time the forces of technology, competition and deregulation have led to this revolutionary transformation in the telecommunications and information services industry. This unprecedented speed of change has transformed opportunities for new entrepreneurs and established companies alike. It is incumbent on Government to introduce policies and practices which foster market driven infrastructure and services and these, in turn, will create new choices for people to live, work, learn and create.</P>
      <P>The Internet is the fastest growing telecommunications network in history. By next year it will have created a single global market of well more than 300 million people. To put this in context, that is as big as the Single European Market. Therefore, Ireland must adapt to move its focus from the Single Market to the cyber market. The Internet has the capacity to overturn current orthodoxy and will create a critical need for high transmission speeds and better connectivity and will lead to the development of entirely new models of pricing, regulations and ownership.</P>
      <P>Ireland is well established as a world class supplier of knowledge intensive goods and services to an increasingly open and competitive global market. The strong economic growth in recent years is built on the solid foundations of a stable macro-economic policy, social partnership and an industrial policy focusing on the development of high-skilled sectors. To sustain this growth and to add value to what has already been achieved, Ireland must become a global leader in the development of electronic commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that electronic commerce will migrate towards countries which provide low cost, high quality telecommunications and Internet services, the right mix of technically skilled people and a supportive, progressive legal framework. This Bill is aimed at providing a key piece of that jigsaw. In the Internet world neither physical size nor location necessarily dictate success and this is to Ireland's advantage. With appropriate strategic positioning, Ireland can sustain its <Col N="1000" /><Col N="1001" /> position as Europe's leading knowledge economy. However, it is essential that Government and all sectors of the community take a pro-active role in addressing the many critical things that need to be done to sustain that position. The facilitation of electronic commerce in this far-sighted legislation is one of those key enablers.</P>
    <P>The Title of the Bill might suggest that it is important only for the commercial world but that is a misleading impression. My vision of what the information society should mean in Ireland is one that includes all of society &ndash; homes, schools, businesses and Government agencies &ndash; interconnected in the first fully networked nation. In a sense, both processes must work in tandem. If business in Ireland is to be able to take full advantage of e-commerce, then it will need staff and customers who are capable of working in an electronic world.</P>
    <P>In addition to regional disparities, social disparities and the emerging digital divide must be addressed. As with most new technologies the business community was the early adopter and e-commerce is no different. For example, despite the fact that almost every business in the country now has a fax machine, they have yet to become a feature of most homes, except in those owned by politicians. It is no surprise, therefore, that business-to-business e-commerce is by far the largest segment of the market. The strategic advantage we are giving Ireland in e-commerce should be seen as a national asset to be exploited for the common good. It is my objective to ensure that there is gain sharing for all the community in the opportunities ahead.</P>
    <P>The Internet revolution and the emerging knowledge economy demand new ways of thinking, working, interacting and even new ways of commuting. The electronic commerce revolution will turn what are currently called atypical working arrangements, such as teleworking, into typical working arrangements. The information society and investment in the proper infrastructure can release much needed resources and can tap latent talent and initiative. They can also uncork some of the serious infrastructural bottlenecks facing us in more developed parts of the country. It has even been predicted that the Internet could even reverse the centuries old trend of urbanisation and allow more of us benefit from the better quality of life of the countryside.</P>
    <P>Most of all, it can lead to a more democratic, open and inclusive society. Internet access and the wholesale availability of Government and local authority services on-line can empower people. Electronic Government can offer significant improvements to the democratic process. It will enhance access, give a real voice and make politicians and public officials more accountable in their actions to the public who elected and appointed them. They will facilitate a more flexible working environment, which is more conducive to a higher quality of life.</P>
    <P>Ireland is on the cusp of a major opportunity in this area. This Bill, the International Connectivity <Col N="1002" /> Project, the broad-band programmes, the national development plan, the technology foresight initiative and the Government's Programme for Prosperity and Fairness amount to an enormous application of resources to this area. In applying those resources, we must not forget this unprecedented opportunity to leave a lasting legacy and to buttress all Irish society into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>With regard to the background and purpose of the Bill, when trying to legislate for the Internet, we can learn much from its anarchist origins. The success of the Internet can be attributed in large part to the open, free and borderless nature of the network. Given those origins, the last thing the Internet needs at this stage is the heavy hand of Government regulation. As the Internet grows, it begins to mirror society more, more commerce, more legal cases, more confrontations to control what is going on. The challenge for Government is to strike the right balance between the various forces of control, Government regulation, self-regulation by industry, the free market and technological progress. This Bill strikes the correct balance and, in no small part, that is down to the way in which it was developed.</P>
    <P>A radically different approach to formulating legislation is required to address the issues raised by the Internet. One aspect of this new approach is more open consultation during the legislative process. This Bill is the product of extensive public consultation from the outset. The original consultation paper published last August was drafted during a series of workshops and focus groups organised by the Department. That consultation process proved very successful and submissions were received from different businesses, organisations and individuals. An on-line discussion forum was also opened to encourage public debate on the proposals. This is a model for how Internet technologies can help in the legislative and public policy processes.</P>
    <P>All the submissions were taken into account during the drafting of the Bill and I would like to think that as a result we have before us a much improved Bill, which I am sure will be further improved by amendments that will be tabled to it by Members on all sides of the House on later Stages.</P>
    <P>The Bill also takes account of the global context. The Internet is a truly global phenomenon and national legislation must take account of international developments. During the drafting of the Bill a variety of legislative models were studied. In particular, the Bill draws on the electronic commerce model law published by the United Nations' Commission on International Trade Law, which was developed to help countries around the globe develop compatible laws on e-commerce. The Bill also implements the European Union's Electronic Signature Directive, which creates a harmonised approach to the legal recognition of electronic signatures throughout its member states.</P>
    <P>The Bill is founded on two basic principles, <Col N="1003" /> functional equivalence of electronic media and technology neutrality. Functional equivalence means that communications using electronic means should not be treated any differently under the law than communications using traditional media. Given the extraordinary pace of technological developments in this area, it would be foolhardy to endorse a particular technology, which is why the Bill is drafted in a technology neutral fashion.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also founded on the principle that Internet users should have free and open access to whatever level of security technologies with which they feel comfortable. Technological solutions exist to allow commercial transactions to be carried out with confidence and to ensure that privacy is preserved. Many of these solutions are based on some form of cryptography and it is essential that Internet users have easy access to strong cryptography. This policy is enshrined and underpinned by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a first step in adapting our Statute Book to take account of the realities of the Internet. It would be impossible and undesirable to introduce a new set of laws for e-commerce. There is no reason the laws that currently govern traditional commerce should not apply to e-commerce. Company law, consumer law and privacy law already lay down principles that apply equally off-line as on-line. What may be required, however, is that this legislation be amended to take account of this new way of doing business.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to simply remove existing legal impediments and uncertainties that have arisen as a result of the onset and continuing growth of e-commerce. It allows consumers and business the freedom to use electronic communications to satisfy existing legal requirements. The legislation is not intended to introduce a new legal framework for e-commerce, it is intended to be enabling.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline the purpose of each section. Section 1 contains the short title and provides for the commencement of the Bill, once enacted. Much of the Bill is based on the Electronic Signature Directive. Important definitions in section 2 are &ldquo;electronic communication&rdquo;, &ldquo;electronic signature&rdquo; and &ldquo;information&rdquo;. &ldquo;Public body&rdquo; is defined to include all Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 8 are standard legislative provisions. Section 8 lays down the penalties for offences under the Bill. One purpose of the Bill is to engender confidence and trust in e-commerce. A number of submissions during the consultation process suggested that the maximum fine proposed of £80,000 should be increased substantially. The Bill provides for fines of up to half a million pounds.</P>
    <P>Part 2 provides for equivalence between the electronic and paper world. Section 9 lays down the fundamental principle on which the Bill is founded, that information in electronic form can<Col N="1004" /> not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability merely on the basis that it is in electronic form.</P>
    <P>A number of areas of our laws to which it is proposed the Bill will not initially apply are outlined in section 10. Laws governing the registration of immovable property, wills, trusts and enduring powers of attorney are excluded because it is felt the technology and systems are not yet at a stage where they could cope with the execution of such transactions electronically. These areas are excluded only for the time being. Once it is appropriate to extend the legislation to these areas, the Minister of the day has the power to make regulations to extend the application of the legislation to them.</P>
    <P>Section 11 clarifies that nothing in the Bill shall prejudice tax law. We want to ensure the Bill does not inadvertently contradict tax law or create loopholes for tax avoidance. This provision in no way hinders the Revenue Commissioners from dealing electronically with their customers. The Revenue Commissioners and its related area has been one of the first areas to adapt smartly to the electronic age.</P>
    <P>Section 12 sets out basic requirements that writing in electronic form must meet. At the time the writing was given, the author must reasonably expect that the writing be accessible for subsequent reference. A distinction is made between the requirements of public and private bodies. In essence, this allows public bodies to lay down their requirements before being obliged to receive writing electronically. Private bodies require the consent of the recipient to use electronic writing. That provision is very necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is similar in format to the previous section and deals with the use of electronic signatures in place of written signatures under the law. This provision is designed to eliminate uncertainty in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 14 allows for signatures to be witnessed electronically. In this case advanced electronic signatures must be used because they offer a higher level of authenticity, which is considered appropriate for documents that need to be witnessed.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for an electronic method of meeting the requirement for a seal using electronic signatures.</P>
    <P>Section 17 allows for the retention and subsequent production of documents electronically.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is one of the most important sections. As with electronic signatures, it is unclear at present whether contracts concluded by electronic means are valid. This provision clarifies that they are. It provides that a contract may be concluded using electronic communications and lays down the principle that a contract shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in electronic form.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for basic presumptions regarding the determination of who actually sent a particular electronic communication. It will be deemed to be that of the originator if it was sent <Col N="1005" /> by the originator. Section 20 provides for the acknowledgement of receipt of electronic communications. Various levels of acknowledgements are available to users of electronic communications. Section 21 provides default rules for determining when and from where electronic communications are sent, and when and where they are received.</P>
    <P>The information society action plan published last year gave a commitment that my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, would look at enactment of legislation dealing with electronic evidence in courts. Section 22 addresses this action point by providing for the admissibility of electronic information as evidence in legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that everyone will not want or be in a position to communicate electronically and that parallel paper and electronic systems will have to be maintained into the future. Section 23 clarifies this point by stating that nothing in the Bill can be interpreted as requiring the use of electronic communications. As awareness of the benefits of communicating electronically increases, the number of people wishing to migrate from the paper to the electronic form will grow. However, the education levels and attitude changes will take time to achieve.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for a number of offences for the fraudulent use of electronic signatures, signature creation devices and electronic certificates.</P>
    <P>Section 25 was accepted by me as a Committee Stage amendment in the Upper House. Given the nature of the Internet, the systems used to commit offences may well be located outside the State. Section 26 lays down the investigative procedures for the offences created in the previous section.</P>
    <P>Section 27 ensures that nothing in the Bill can be construed as requiring the disclosure or enabling the seizure of keys or codes used to keep information confidential. Such protection is essential for the security of e-commerce and was something that received widespread industry support during the consultation process.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill provides for matters relating to the service providers who issue electronic signature certificates or provide other services related to electronic signatures. These service providers are known in the Bill as certification service providers. This Part of the Bill is derived from the electronic signature directive. The market for such service is only beginning and there are only a handful of organisations planning to offer services in Ireland at present. These provisions are designed to offer flexibility. Strong prescriptive regulation of the market, before it is even created, could hinder the growth of the market.</P>
    <P>Section 28 gives the Minister the power to prescribe accreditation and supervision schemes for certification service providers. The final shape of <Col N="1006" /> the schemes has yet to be determined. This will be a matter which will be looked at in the light of market developments and developments in other member states. However, the National Accreditation Board has begun a pilot accreditation scheme and is co-ordinating with its European colleagues.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the liability of certification service providers. This is a very important section given that the issue of the accreditation and certification service has arisen quite often. I hope the provisions of the Bill will give certainty to it.</P>
    <P>Section 30 gives the Minister the power to place the registration of Irish Internet domain names on a statutory basis. The two-letter code assigned to Ireland for domain names is IE, which incidentally are the initials of Íarnród Éireann. The IE domain name is a national resource which should be managed in the public interest as in the interests of the Internet community.</P>
    <P>The Schedule repeats the annexes to the electronic signatures directive for reference purposes.</P>
    <P>I am sure one or two amendments will be tabled by the various parties and I undertake to look positively at them if they fit into the format of the Bill. I am always amused at people who think a Bill is perfect and question why amendments should be accepted. I always approach it from the other side. Why bring a Bill to Second Stage and Committee Stage if there is not wisdom to be absorbed from other people and other parties? I hope that is how this Bill will proceed.</P>
    <P>I did not go through the detail of the Schedules because it is available in my speech. I wish to pay tribute, as I did in the other House, to the information society which has been an active umbrella group for all that is taking place in this area. I praise the acumen of the previous Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, who set up the information society and the work which flowed and continues to flow from it, including the series of seminars. This was the beginning of the surge forward in electronic commerce.</P>
    <P>I met Patricia Hewitt, the UK Minister responsible for electronic commerce, who came to see me about two months ago. We had a good discussion. The UK Bill went on for months because half way through, it got overlaid with bureaucracy. In her communications with me when we met and since then, she said they dabbled in bringing the Bill down paths it need never have gone.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be simple. It is an enabling Bill. Therefore, it does not have to be burdensome or bureaucratic but must be capable of being understood. Business wants to do its business in this way. Whatever about business to the consumer, the growth of which will be reasonably limited, people will always want to feel the fabric, look at the goods, press the melon or whatever. Certainly business on the Internet is huge. Underpinning that will be the validity and authenticity of electronic signatures.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="1007" />
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the spirit in which the Minister commended the Bill to the House in so far as she was receptive to looking at possible improvements. I welcome the Bill and will not oppose it on Second Stage. All the business people who advised me on e-living and e-policy favour this light and subtle regulatory approach. I have studied in detail the House of Commons debates on both the Electronic Communications Bill and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill. I have heard many say the UK got it wrong and that we are moving in the right direction. In the same way as the Minister always questions whether the Bill is perfect, I wish to propose to the Minister for her consideration some detailed points of amendment. If the construction industry said it should be able to build where it likes, when it likes, the people would say there should be planning laws. If the pharmaceutical industry said it could produce whatever drugs it wished irrespective of the poisons, the people would say there should be a licensing procedure. Perhaps in 20 years' time people will look back and say it was crazy to let this e-commerce world have a free run. I am not just speaking of Ireland but the world.</P>
      <P>The US has little or no regulation. There are some important considerations of privacy for the individual such as protection for business. We need to take a balanced approach. I welcome the Bill. I support the idea that Ireland would be a European hub for e-commerce. As part of Ireland's competitiveness, we should welcome e-commerce in all its facets. We should not be in any way complacent because much needs to be done to improve the telecommunications market and make it better for investment in the e-business world. I have no argument with the pace of change and the need for Ireland to have a regulatory regime to ensure the value of a piece of paper is the same whether it is in written or electronic form. I support the Bill in so far as it applies the principle that everything in electronic writing has equal validity to conventional writing in paper form.</P>
      <P>However, further liberalisation of telecommunications is urgently needed, specifically regarding the unbundling of the local loop to which I will refer later. Although this relates to industrial policy, incentives are still needed to encourage small businesses and enable them to participate in e-business activities. More needs to be done about the awareness of e-commerce and there is a need for more on-line Government services. There is also a need to greatly expand Internet access in schools and throughout the country. A new generation of Internet access devices needs to be prepared. I intend to table a number of amendments to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is not moving them now and is only outlining the thrust of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am only setting them out. The <Col N="1008" /> key issue is that if business is transacted, there will be a digital, numerical, electronic signature which is called cryptography. If a business wants an electronic signature, it will have to approach somebody who will give it a certificate. There is no provision in the Bill to formally register cryptographers. In the UK, the Electronic Communications Bill sets out in detail that the Secretary of State shall establish a registrar or an authority. There may be only two or three in the country, but the people who give out certificates of electronic signatures should, in turn, be registered. I intend to table an amendment to ensure that an authority or a registrar of cryptography is established.</P>
      <P>Section 30 proposes that domain names should be registered. However, that relates to dot.ie operations. It should be done also in relation to the handful of cryptographers. For example, if a row developed and a digital signature was copied, one would want to be able to go to the authority and show the validation process. At present, anybody could set up a company and give out these signatures. This area needs to be supervised &ndash; this happened in the UK and elsewhere. I do not mind if the Patents Office, the Company Registration Office, the Department or UCD does it, but a body should have that role. There should be a register or registrar of cryptographers which would, in turn, be the certifying authority. It could be modelled on the proposals in section 30 in relation to domain names.</P>
      <P>Regarding privacy, it deeply disturbs me that if I surf the net at home, my Internet service provider &ndash; in my case, Eircom &ndash; can track every site I visit. In addition, various marketing companies can put a cookie on my line and find out every site I visit. This is my personal information and I have rights of protection. I have these rights in other areas under the data protection directive. As the Minister is aware, in the public service people have rights with regard to information. It should be illegal for an Internet service provider &ndash; ISP &ndash; to have unauthorised tracking of all traffic. Marketing companies should not be able to track a person's surfing of the net without the individual's authorisation. From the date of the enactment of the Bill, any personal information should be deleted.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 19 May in which it was stated that politicians should wake up, that the State only took an interest because bertieahern.com was a porn site and that there are other issues. It mentioned the woeful ignorance of Deputies and it said key Internet issues included privacy, control of information, right to domain names and cyber squatting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point made in the article with which I agree is that the Commission set out a data protection directive in 1998 in relation to general data protection which gives personal privacy and this should be applied to the Internet world. Websites can assemble all types of personal data about individuals, so-called passive data, without their <Col N="1009" /> knowledge. There is a need for a minimum privacy policy and restrictions on sending spams, that is, unsolicited e-mail advertisements. If I am interested in betting and I am a client of Paddy Power's, another company could get a list of Paddy Power's clients and write to them asking them to join a racing ownership club etc. This information should be private to the person with whom one is transacting.</P>
    <P>There are examples of rows where people want to know how others got their names and how they are able to write to them. I do not want a massive tome of legislation but basic, individual rights of privacy arise in this area. At present, there is no privacy policy at all. The Minister may mention the US and the statistics regarding how much further it has developed with regard to e-commerce. However, in the US, the Federal Trade Commission has been asked to report on this area. An advisory committee is in the final stages of deliberations and its view is that there must be a move away from the current <i>laissez-faire</i> approach.</P>
    <P>It does not surprise me that every dot.com operation to whom I speak does not want a heavy hand, but I must speak for individuals, the private citizens who have PCs and who will have set top boxes which will enable them to access the Internet via their televisions. Given the many issues in relation to convergence and other possibilities with regard to using the Internet, it is time to address this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with electronic signatures. I agree with the Deputy regarding the wider issues, but this precise Bill relates only to electronic signatures. I agree with the Deputy about the overall issue of privacy. One receives much junk mail in one's letterbox and one often wonders how people got one's name and address.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be easy to draft amendments, but I am seeking a simple provision to ensure that no one can track an individual's activity on the Internet without authorisation. In addition, no one should be allowed to retain information without authorisation and any such information should be deleted.</P>
      <P>As Ireland grows in the world of e-commerce, there is a need for an appeal body or an authority to deal with dispute resolution. This authority would deal with domain names and a number of other issues. At EU level, there is a need for Ireland to pioneer moves in this area. At present there is voluntary regulation, there is not even self-regulation by ISPs. However, a dispute resolution mechanism would facilitate everybody. If it does not work, people can go to the courts. I am not raising many issues, including pornography and criminal activity on the Internet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising those areas, I am dealing with relevant issues. There is a question about consumer protection and I will refer later to a specific point in relation to the Consumer Credit Act, 1995. If I make an e-commerce purchase of a book or a holiday, what on-line arbitration exists by way of consumer protection? This is a serious concern. Will the Director of Consumer Affairs, Carmel Foley, have any function in terms of electronic retail purchases? We need to make provision for a role in this legislation for the Director of Consumer Affairs to protect the individual. I know that, if I do my Christmas shopping on high streets such as Grafton Street or in Athlone or wherever, the law of the land will protect me. If I buy from an Irish company over the Internet &ndash; I understand it is different if I buy from a company in the Czech Republic or Panama, for example &ndash; will I have the consumer protection I would otherwise have? I refer especially to the 1991 Contractual Obligations (Applicable Law) Act, the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act, 1988, and the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act, 1993. Will these apply to electronic commerce? If they are not to, I will seek for them to apply.</P>
      <P>Section 10 refers to exclusions and section 10(1)(<i>b</i>) states &ldquo;the law governing the manner in which an interest in real property (including a leasehold interest in such property)&rdquo;. I understand that, at the draft heads stage, the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council wanted property excluded and it appears on reading the paragraph that it is excluded. However, my legal advice is that the paragraph also states &ldquo;other than contracts&rdquo; and that this negatives all that goes before it. If I buy a house, that is dealt with by contract. Contracts are not excluded and my legal advice is that the wording is contradictory. While property is excluded, contracts are not and they cover property. I would like that clarified.</P>
      <P>I studied the EU electronic commerce directive. I understand that it has yet to be formally agreed by the Council of Ministers but it appears settled in its terminology. On studying the text, a series of directives were included and another excluded. The basis for the exclusion is unclear, either from the Minister's speech or the debate in the Seanad. There is no provision for exclusion in terms of Directive No. 93/13 on unfair terms of consumer contracts. There is no provision for the directives on misleading advertising, comparative advertising, consumer credit, package travel, consumer product pricing, distance consumer contracts, tobacco advertising and medicinal products advertising. Of these, five are not implemented in international legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive No. 87/102 on consumer credit is not excluded. We have implemented that directive through the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, and that was landmark legislation. Under that Act, if I obtain credit, it is a kernel of the law that there be a cooling-off period of ten days. If that trans<Col N="1011" /> action took place on-line and one read the conditions quickly and agreed to them, one might not notice the reference to the ten days, because it is different from receiving a hard copy. Many share dealings now take place on-line. People could agree to conditions on-line which they might not have had they known about them and they might have been more likely to have noticed them had they received written documentation.</P>
    <P>We should examine the EU directives which have been implemented and section 10 and reform the procedure for electronic purchasing so that the terms of the Consumer Credit Act would still apply and a hard copy of the contract would have to be received within ten days. There is a difference between a credit agreement presented on screen and to which a consumer can agree electronically and a written agreement which is physically sent to a consumer. That a consumer receives a hard copy is cautionary to him or her. Furthermore, it is more conducive to skimming through and a consumer is more likely to spot the clear statement of the cooling-off period. Consumer credit is already offered on a large scale on the Internet. I note the growth of electronic stockbrokers offering significant credit. There is a need to protect the unwary, especially in times of exuberant markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that detailed debate of sections should be confined to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was all over the place in my speech, the Acting Chairman would caution me for not being relevant. However, I will not go into much detail about European directives.</P>
      <P>Section 22 deals with admissibility of evidence in court. The point at issue is whether a hard copy or an electronic copy would suffice. I will seek to insert in subparagraph (i) the wording &ldquo;on the sole ground that it is not in its original form&rdquo;. In other words, an electronic copy should suffice. I am told that this has already been changed in criminal law and I seek for the same to apply here. The provision refers to the &ldquo;best evidence&rdquo; rule of evidence. This is a common law rule requiring the party seeking to rely on a document to produce the original document in question. The rule does not apply if the original has been destroyed or is otherwise impossible to obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of the rule to electronic dealings is awkward. Where a hard copy document has been scanned and transmitted, for example, a technical certificate as to a goods of sale transaction, it requires one obtaining the original hard copy. Where a document was originally generated and transmitted in electronic form, identifying the original is difficult and pointless. If a court has no doubts as to the reliability of a copy, be it an electronic version of a document, the best evidence rule creates a pointless exercise. That is why the rule was abolished in criminal law under section 30 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992. <Col N="1012" /> Under that section, a copy of a document authenticated in such a manner as the court may approve may be given in evidence. However, as it stands, section 22 seems to enshrine the best evidence rule. It states that, if there is an original hard copy, one can rely on an electronic version only if one can satisfy the court the electronic version was the best evidence one could be reasonably expected to obtain. The balance of this provision is against the use of electronic versions. They are the poor relations. My amendment prevents a court from refusing to admit an electronic version on the sole ground that it is not in its original form. Perhaps the Minister would consider that.</P>

      <P>Yes, so that the status of the electronic version would be improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt awkward about mentioning that part of the Bill in my initial contributions both here and in the Seanad. It appeared that there was a grudging acceptance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would examine that. I will table an amendment.</P>
      <P>Section 29 deals with liability of certification providers. This provides for strict liability. No matter what, they are in the wrong. I was told it would be more sensible to include the words &ldquo;if negligent&rdquo;. In other words, there may be circumstances where strict liability might be too harsh. If the amendment were to be accepted, the relevant wording would read &ldquo;shall be liable if negligent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Perhaps when the Minister replies she could answer some questions for me. I am a fan of Lennox Lewis but when I call up his site on the Internet I get stories about what fights he won two or three years ago. Out of date information and news stories are retained on the Internet. If I said outrageous things about the Minister, regardless of whether they are true, they could be printed on the Internet and left there for some time. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position on defamation law.</P>
      <P>Can mortgage contracts be done by electronic commerce? The EU electronic signatures directive was adopted in December 1999. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if we have incorporated the OECD guidelines on cryptography and if we have complied with certain legal aspects of the EU electronic commerce directive and the data protection directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards hackers, credit card fraud and viruses, such as the &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; virus which emanated from the Far East, what protection is there for e-commerce operators and individuals? The British are in a quagmire with their surveillance units, such as CID and MI5. I am not looking for <Col N="1013" /> that to be introduced here. However, disreputable people may become Internet service providers. We need an enabling provision which allows us to deal with hackers, fraudsters and people who design computer viruses.</P>
    <P>I will shortly publish my party's proposals for e-living. I welcome global crossing and deregulation. Every Member received a letter recently from Esat Telecom about the local loop. In the provision of a full range of advanced telecommunications facilities, Eircom has sole access to the last leg of the loop, homes and businesses, except where broad band fibre optic cable has already been laid. We will not duplicate that network everywhere. The ODTR published a decision in April which stated there would be a restricted form of access to the local loop, called bitstream access, by April 2001. The telecommunications regulator stated she had no legal powers to mandate full unbundling. It is, therefore, imperative that the Government establishes the legal basis for that. I am told by those who are talking about bringing Sprint and Quest into the hub of e-commerce that full unbundling is the key to liberalisation. If the regulator says she does not have the legal powers to do so, it falls to the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>It needs primary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>That would do more for competition as it would mean someone could rent the line from Eircom and pay it a fair price.</P>
      <P>If we can introduce global crossing, we should also have a national plan of broad band access to schools, not just around the perimeter of Dublin but throughout the country. I understand the Government paid £60 million and will charge businesses for global crossing.</P>
      <P>The Government should introduce income tax credits or social welfare subsidies so that more homes can buy personal computers. There is an excellent model in Sweden. A fund should be established in disadvantaged areas and rural communities. This was done in Ennis which won the Telecom Éireann competition. I would like to see that expanded to other areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider an earlier date on the four year exclusivity of Cablelink, which NTL owns. That would help to open up the area of convergence technology. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, must attract high speed Internet access operators and infrastructure service providers to this country. I am thinking of tier one operators, such as Quest, and others, such as Sprint. We should not be complacent as more needs to be done. Free Internet access is a reality in most European states. It would be a great help if it was available here by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Tony Blair, through the Minister mentioned and Mr. Peter Mandelson before that, set specific targets that by 2002 50% of all civil servants would be accessible through e-mail and that <Col N="1014" /> all payments could be done on-line. We need a single gateway point so that people can log on to the Government site and access information relating to social welfare, tax, small business development and education. We also need a specific training and investment programme in each Department, VAT refunds for the disabled and for technology purchases and a home working allowance to encourage it.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on the domain name. We need a quality brand which is authentically Irish and recognised internationally for its excellence. We need to put some thought into it and to market it properly.</P>
    <P>Skills and people shortages are a big problem. A specific programme will be required for graduate engineers and to increase the participation of females. Some 52% of all students are females, yet they only represent 30% of workers in the high-technology area. That must be changed if we want to meet future demands.</P>
    <P>Small business initiatives are also needed. The first £100,000 of profits from e-business should be at a lower rate of tax. E-incubators would help small business to become established. Stock options could be taxed at capital gains tax rates rather than marginal income tax rates.</P>
    <P>We have not debated e-commerce before. A half an hour is not long enough for the principal spokespersons as this is a serious debate. I welcome the Bill and I will support its speedy enactment. However, there are specific gaps in the legislation and some sections could be reworded. We all support e-commerce but that does not mean a reasonable and limited amount of personal protections should not be put in place at the same time.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille um Thráchtáil Leictreonach, 2000. Tá an Bille tráthúil agus tábhachtach. Láidreoidh an Bille an reachtaíocht sa Stát seo a bhaineann le cúrsaí tráchtála leictreonach. Tá an tír seo láidir, ó thaobh aois nua seo na fáisnéise agus, le cúnamh Dé, cabhróidh an Bille le caomhnú agus forbairt chumas na tíre seo i gcúrsaí tráchtála leictreonach. Athraíonn an teicneolaíocht seo go tobann agus bíonn daoine caillte go minic, chomh casta is atá sé. Beidh an Lucht Oibre ag cabhrú leis an Aire an Bille a sheoladh tríd an Teach, chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Bill. I compliment the Minister for the way she has handled it during its gestation. The consultation period was useful and exhaustive and the briefing which spokespersons received from her officials some months ago was valuable. It was clear what the Minister intended to achieve at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a substantial Bill which, when passed into law, should enhance Ireland's position in terms of competing in the information age. Ireland already has a substantial advantage over our European partners in terms of competitiveness in this new age. That this country domi<Col N="1015" /> nates foreign direct investment in the electronic area and that 44% of software projects locate here is a good measure of our high development base. Approximately 40% of all packaged software and 60% of all business applications software produced in Europe is made in Ireland. We are also dominant in the teleservices industry, with 28% of all European investment based in Ireland. It is apparent that this country has an excellent base to protect and further develop.</P>
    <P>Technology changes so rapidly that it must always be our target to be at the cutting edge of development. The Bill seeks to create a legal framework for electronic commerce and facilitate growth. The Labour Party will co-operate in enabling its early passage into law and we hope it will have the desired effect in terms of enhancing trust and confidence in this country's electronic commerce environment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify whether the Bill will adequately cover the various identifiable difficulties which could possibly arise from the convergence of Internet, broadcasting and telephony services? Given that the same item of equipment will probably serve as the vehicle by which these services will be delivered in the future, is it possible that security difficulties will emerge? I fully accept that seeking to foretell the future of this area, where the pace of change is so rapid and bewildering, will not be easy. Nonetheless, we should seek to use legislation to close off areas of possible difficulty.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister provide further assurances in respect of the points which have already been raised in this debate in respect of security and privacy? With the enactment of the legislation we will move away from a paper based commerce environment to an electronic alternative. When changes take place there is always a danger that leakages might occur. Will the Minister indicate the extent to which this matter has been examined in depth? The flexible approach adopted by the Minister, whereby she has indicated that she will be neither overly prescriptive or heavy-handed, is good. However, the Labour Party is concerned that people's privacy may be invaded. I will return to this matter later.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the information age, we must realise that IT access for all must be a fundamental tenet of the legal framework which regulates electronic commerce and transactions in Ireland. In that context, I wish to consider another aspect of the Minister's brief &ndash; I accept that responsibility for it also lies with another Department &ndash; namely, digital television. A regime is developing under which there will be an expansion in subscription and pay-per-view television services. The Labour Party is of the opinion that we are failing in our duty to the electorate if access to all television programming does not come within the comfortable reach of all citizens.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent initiative to make Internet access available in public libraries. Will the <Col N="1016" /> Minister indicate the extent to which rural post offices, sub-post offices, etc., can become involved in electronic commerce? A great deal of aspirational comment is made about this area. However, it is difficult to identify from where potential business might emanate to provide additional income to these post offices which, as the Minister is aware, are coming under increasing pressure. I will be interested to hear her comments on this matter.</P>
    <P>The March report of the Information Society Commission outlines a number of themes which consistently arose in the 50 submissions it received in response to its discussion document on IT access for all. The needs identified were: to promote general access to information and communications technology across the community; to identify the social benefits of information and communications technology; to couple access to new technology with training for the general public; and to target disadvantaged and marginalised areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with electronic commerce as it affects large and small industries, etc. I suspect that the extent to which this medium will be accessible to the general public or to which members of the public will wish to avail of it will not be great. As the Minister stated, however, electronic commerce can have the effect of reversing a trend which has held sway for a number of centuries by encouraging people to move away from urban areas and return to rural areas. Everyone would welcome such a development. Does the Bill contain a specific mechanism to facilitate this process? I do not believe it does but I understand, to a large extent, why that is the case.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on how it is proposed to target disadvantaged and marginalised groups? Is there any guarantee that people who wish to leave urban areas and return to rural areas to pursue their livelihoods will not suffer financially as a result? Does the Minister believe the issue of identifying the social benefits of information and communications technology should be addressed in the Bill?</P>
    <P>An interesting survey was conducted by the MRBI on behalf of the Information Society Commission in late August of last year. One finding, which must give rise to concern, is that only 39% of people felt confident that Government agencies would not misuse personal information held about them. That is quite alarming. In addition, 62% of those questioned were concerned about organisations in general holding personal information about them on computer. This leads me back to the question of people's civil rights, their security and their privacy. I want the Bill to be strengthened in every possible way in order to ensure that these are protected. The Minister's reply to the debate will have a bearing on the amendments the Labour Party will consider tabling on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The MRBI poll describes an attitude of mind which needs to be addressed in order that we can <Col N="1017" /> gain the maximum benefit from developments in e-commerce. If people are suspicious of a new technology difficulties may arise and they may be hesitant about or less than committed to embracing something which will be of great benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>Although 57% of Irish people felt they would be in a position to take advantage of the work and lifestyle changes which would arise from new technologies, when they were asked whether they felt changes to information and communications technology would make their jobs and lifestyle more secure, 36% agreed that it would, 35% disagreed and 29% did not know. There is an underlying concern here that this type of technology may result in jobs being suppressed and that we should be careful not to become overly technical.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is due to introduce an Bille um cheartanna Gaeilge, the Irish language rights Bill. Has the Minister held any discussions with Deputy de Valera in regard to people being able to transact their business with State Departments, local authorities and health boards through Irish? Obviously, this would be a very important aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred to the issues of security and privacy and complimented the Minister on the innovative approach which was developed in that regard. The interpretations section of the Bill is one of the most difficult I have ever read. Some of the terminology used will inevitably need to be changed in the future. The Minster's point about this Bill being enabling legislation is relevant in this context because she will have the power to adapt as situations change.</P>
    <P>The poll carried out by MRBI on behalf of the Information Technology Commission showed that in the year 1998-99, Internet access doubled from 16% to 33%. We are probably heading towards 40% and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt very adequately with the various sections of the Bill and I would like to see it passing into law as soon as possible. The Minister stressed the urgency of this Bill which will allow the success of this area of our economy to be built upon. The concerns expressed on this side of the House about privacy and security are very real and must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the highly successful innovation in regard to the Internet discussion forum which lays the foundations for future legislation. I wish the Minister every success with the Bill. We will return to it in a very positive and constructive manner on Committee Stage and will assist the Minister to put the best possible Bill on the Statute Book without delay.</P>

Gabhaim comhgháirdeachas leis <Col N="1018" /> an Aire agus leis an Roinn as ucht an sárobair a rinne siad ar an mBille agus as ucht an comhoibriú atá ar fáil faoin mBille agus faoi na heachtraí a bheidh ag tárlú tar éis an Bhille.</P>
      <P>The Electronic Commerce Bill is designed to create a legal framework to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce and electronic transactions in Ireland. This framework will help to engender trust and confidence in the Irish electronic commerce environment. The Bill is intended to meet one of the key priorities of this Government by providing comprehensive legislation which addresses many of the legal issues which have arisen as a result of the development of electronic commerce. It also implements the provisions of two EU directives, namely the directive relating to electronic signatures and part of the recently adopted electronic commerce directive.</P>
      <P>This legislation is a proud achievement which has been welcomed widely in the industry and has received favorable reviews from many commentators. I was glad to note that the Bill was broadly welcomed in the Seanad and by the Members who have spoken already today. While it sets out standards and technical provisions for e-commerce transactions, it does much more than that. It represents a bold move into a new era, clearly indicating the direction we wish to take as a country.</P>
      <P>The legislation clearly indicates that Ireland is ready and prepared for e-commerce and is not taking a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach. We want to see the benefits of e-commerce fully applied to broad areas of public and private law and we want to see the benefits of e-commerce taking hold in business and public administration. This legislation is part of this Government's strategy to prepare Ireland for the digital economy. We have an integrated, well resourced set of measures and initiatives, firmly placed within a strategy enhanced by foresight, imagination and ambition, for the future economic development of this country.</P>
      <P>As my Government colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, stated, we now have the necessary infrastructure, providing broad-band connectivity, to link Ireland to global markets. Geographical and physical boundaries are no longer inhibiting issues. The issue which will determine our future competitiveness will be how we harness the potential of new technologies and use them to enhance economic welfare and the social economy for all our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to outline a number of interlocking policy areas which come into play in this area. One of the key areas relates to the need to ensure a supportive legal and regulatory environment. The Electronic Commerce Bill has been hailed as an instrument which will positively support and enable e-commerce. We have avoided the heavy-handed approach and have created a key enabling instrument for the development of e-commerce. However, e-commerce does not occur <Col N="1019" /> within a vacuum but rather within the framework of existing laws.</P>
    <P>We recognise that trust and confidence are essential ingredients for the development of e-commerce. There is a need for robust laws to protect copyright, privacy and the rights of the consumer in cases where new technology gives rise to new uncertainties. I will refer to three measures in particular. Deputies will be aware that the Copyright Bill has passed Committee Stage and is due to report to the Dáil on 31May. This Bill sets out to put in place a modern regime of statutory protection for copyright and related rights, including civil remedies and criminal sanctions. It contains a number of specific measures, directed at protecting rights in the information age. These include measures against &ldquo;smart card&rdquo; forgery and measures which support rights management, such as digital fingerprinting in electronic copies of copyright works.</P>
    <P>Our existing data protection laws give rights to individuals to protect them against the misuse of personal information held on computers. This law, the Data Protection Act, 1988 also places obligations of care on those who keep personal information about individuals. This law will be supplemented by new measures in a Bill, to be published by July next, which will provide additional protections by strengthening the rights of citizens to information and to be in a position to object to the processing of information.</P>
    <P>Further new measures to be introduced later this year will provide additional rights to consumers who shop on the Internet. These measures stem from EU directives and will ensure that consumers have full information about who they are dealing with, including the price and delivery costs of their Internet purchases.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we are now poised to take advantage of the digital revolution and that there are real benefits for business, the consumer and public administration. It is imperative that this advantage is built against the backdrop of a favourable legislative and regulatory environment.</P>
    <P>Our national economy has undergone rapid and spectacular transformation. The 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s were notable in Ireland for, among other things, energy crises, inflation, unemployment and emigration. Today, Ireland is seen as a success story in a Europe where the main players are still trying to pull themselves out of a stagnant period. Throughout Europe, Ireland's recent economic success has been the subject of much positive comment. This success story did not happen overnight but developed over the past 30 years. In that time our economy has undergone dramatic changes, from a heavy reliance on agriculture in the 1960s, an influx of foreign direct investment in the 1970s and 1980s through to the modern digital economy which began to emerge in the late 1990s.</P>
    <P>Our recent strong economic performance and our enterprise culture are grounded in a success<Col N="1020" /> ful system of social partnership, together with strong and consistent pro-enterprise policies. These include a stable political and policy environment, prudent management of the public finances, investment in key infrastructure, the provision of a well educated and flexible work force, a low business corporation tax regime and the development of an open economy exporting 92 per cent of GDP. All this is set in the context of membership of, and a firm commitment to, the European Union and a conviction that employment through enterprise provides the best model for sharing our economic success.</P>
    <P>From a situation only 20 years ago when advanced communications technology meant push button telephones, the use of advanced information communications technologies or ICTs has become the most significant driver of world economic growth. ICTs are the catalysts through which enterprise, whether traditional or new, can create sustained competitive advantage for its products and services on world markets. ICTs are also the catalysts through which enterprise can create quality and sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>We have a strong base from which to move forward. We have been successful in attracting significant foreign investment in electronics and software, among other areas. According to the OECD, Ireland is the world's largest exporter of software. Nineteen of the top 25 computer companies in the world have located in Ireland and in recent weeks we have seen global leaders in the ICT area locating their e-commerce activities in Ireland. Almost one third of all PCs sold in Europe are made in Ireland.</P>
    <P>To set the scene and to prepare the environment for this new economy, we have recognised the need for a broad based, multi-disciplinary approach to the new challenges presented by the information society. Five priority areas have been identified and are being developed to ensure Ireland retains its place and builds global competitiveness in the new digital economy. These are: telecommunications infrastructure and costs; education in the use of ICTs; upskilling the existing business sector; effective regulation and research and development. This Government is taking a proactive and integrated approach to meeting the challenges presented by the new technologies. Significant advances have been made in all major areas connected with the e-business agenda. I will now briefly outline the main features and actions being taken in these priority areas.</P>
    <P>As a small island on the western fringes of Europe, Ireland has successfully overcome some obvious disadvantages in terms of international trade. However, in these days of advanced communications, the global marketplace knows no physical boundaries and is restricted only by the capacity of a country's connection to the world-wide web. The recent agreement with Global Crossing, providing Ireland with international broadband connectivity, will enable us to provide <Col N="1021" /> up to 15 times the current international capacity out of Ireland at one tenth of the existing unit cost levels. It will mean we will become an integral part of a world class communications chain running from the USA to Ireland and onward to 24 European cities.</P>
    <P>The development of a top class telecommunications infrastructure must be accompanied by low cost telecommunication charges driven by competition. This Government is actively pushing for low cost Internet access for Irish businesses and consumers in order to increase dramatically our Internet usage levels. In this context, I warmly welcome the decision of the Supreme Court last week and we can now look forward to what I hope will be vigorous competition in the mobile phone service market.</P>
    <P>The inherently global nature of modern communication technologies will do away with the obstacle of distance. Our peripheral location in Europe, previously seen as an obstacle to development and access to markets, is less so today. Global markets are available from the desktops anywhere in Ireland. This presents exciting opportunities for small Irish business and for regional development.</P>
    <P>Many have already taken advantage of the new market possibilities. Small businesses who act flexibly, quickly adapting to a rapidly changing environment and responding to new market conditions, can transform their business almost overnight. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the city and county enterprise boards, are helping business to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The e-business initiative that Enterprise Ireland launched last October is now in full flow. The main elements of this initiative are to promote awareness and understanding of the significance and business implications of e-commerce and e-business, to assist clients, especially those in traditional industry sectors, in developing an appropriate Internet strategy and presence and to generate a stream of Internet related investment projects from the software and high tech sectors. These goals are being achieved through a series of focused workshops for Enterprise Ireland clients, through incentives to develop corporate websites and through Enterprise Ireland's e-business resource website which provides the information a business needs to know about doing business online.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has also established a £10 million e-business fund to boost the number of Irish companies transacting business across electronic networks. This initiative will operate over a two year time frame It is designed to facilitate the rapid development of significant scale projects within existing businesses in the manufacturing and international services sectors to enable them to trade electronically.</P>
    <P>The city and county enterprise boards are currently developing an e-commerce initiative for their client base which will be launched later this year. This initiative involves all 35 city and county <Col N="1022" /> enterprise boards in providing services and incentives which will increase the use of the Internet, e-mail and e-commerce among small businesses. I am also allocating a new fund of £3 million for e-commerce initiatives in the micro-enterprise sector. This fund will be administered by the city and county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>Awareness raising events are being held throughout the country involving co-operation between various Government Departments, State agencies, the information society commission, IBEC, the IDA and the chambers of commerce. This is part of a broader strategy aimed at building up a critical mass of information and communication technology users in order to develop trust and confidence in e-commerce for business and the population of Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>Investment in the technological infrastructure must be accompanied by investment in people. In response to the expert group on future skills needs, the Government has allocated a total of £411 million to various educational initiatives designed to develop appropriate skills, to promote innovation and to provide an additional 5,400 new third level college places in high technology courses over the next four years.</P>
    <P>The training agency FÁS in the recently launched FIT &ndash; fast track to IT &ndash; will help 3,500 long-term unemployed persons to secure a job in the IT industry over three years and help meet emerging skill shortages. The Government is also participating in a joint initiative with the universities and IBEC which will provide an extra 1,500 postgraduate places aimed at meeting skills needs in the area of ICTs. The technology investment fund is making £250 million available over a three year period to renew and modernise third level infrastructure. The schools IT initiative, under which the Government is investing £81 million, will facilitate the integration of ICTs into Ireland's schools, including the provision of hardware and support services in schools and skills development for teachers.</P>
    <P>Preparing Ireland for the demands of tomorrow also requires strong investment in research and development. We recently launched a £560 million technology foresight fund that will be used to establish Ireland as a location for world class research excellence in niche areas within ICTs and biotechnology. In addition, a dedicated research foundation will be established to evaluate research projects and to manage and allocate funding. This new fund is an integral part of the Government's new industrial development strategy. It will be used to develop Ireland as a dynamic location for innovation, particularly in the technologies of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Industry and related international investment are becoming increasingly knowledge based as new research and technologies translate into global products and services. Our focus now is on building new sources of competitive advantage for indigenous companies and on ensuring that Ireland becomes one of Europe's most attractive locations for knowledge based, high tech <Col N="1023" /> enterprise. Future competitiveness will depend on the creation and utilisation of new ideas. Ireland must lead and be to the forefront in areas where we have particular strengths. We will continue to pursue world class standards and be industry focused. With this broad based and well funded set of initiatives there can be little doubt about the Government's commitment to make IT the spearhead of the new economy.</P>
    <P>The popular term e-commerce can be loosely defined as buying and selling goods and services on the Internet. This certainly is part of e-business, but the true concept of e-business goes into the heart of how an organisation works. The on-line relationship of a company with both its suppliers and its customers allows products and services to be delivered faster and at a lower cost.</P>
    <P>The real advantage for a company adapting to e-business lies in the back office and supply chain systems. E-business seamlessly moves data and information over networks bringing together previously separate groups, both inside and outside the company. It provides instant information, allowing companies to identify their best selling items or their least productive operation and to modify their business processes to maximise profits.</P>
    <P>E-business is a new concept and one to which companies must adapt if they are to survive. In a few years all business will be e-business. It is our task to ensure that business reaps the benefits of the new information communication technologies.</P>
    <P>E-business is not just for big business or just for technology companies. Recent figures available to us show that e-business awareness is high and that Internet access of those small to medium sized firms surveyed is at 69%. These figures are encouraging. The majority of companies, however, still need to make that jump to a full e-business strategy. Government and agency information and awareness campaigns and conferences will help companies make this leap forward.</P>
    <P>The growth in the use of ICTs and the development of e-business is forging ahead and leaving the older forms of business behind. However, in doing so this creates other uncertainties which need to be dealt with swiftly to ensure that Ireland is a leading player in the global marketplace. Uncertainties such as the electronic form of contracts and their recognition in law, the differences between paper and electronic documents, the use and verification of electronic signatures, the verification of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications, particularly for contract purposes, the growth of service providers in this area and the liability issues which arise raise various concerns and uncertainties which could become obstacles to the development of e-commerce.</P>
    <P>The Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000, is designed to create a legal framework for electronic commerce to facilitate the growth of elec<Col N="1024" /> tronic commerce and electronic transactions in Ireland. The Bill was first mooted in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, as reviewed last November, a key priority of which is &ldquo;to promote a pro-competitive environment in which e-business will flourish and to legislate for electronic signatures and contracts&rdquo;. The Bill is intended to meet this priority by providing comprehensive legislation which addresses many of the legal issues which have arisen as a result of electronic commerce and puts the matters beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>EU legislation has a strong influence on domestic legislation, and the Electronic Commerce Bill is no exception. It transposes the provisions of the Electronic Signatures Directive and certain articles of the recently agreed Electronic Commerce Directive into domestic law. It implements provisions of the Electronic Commerce Directive, which has only been agreed this month. Although we have a further 18 months in which to implement this directive, early transposition is essential to keep Ireland to the forefront in e-business.</P>
    <P>The House has already heard in detail about the provisions of the Bill from my Government colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and I do not wish to dwell much further on its provisions. Essentially, the Bill provides for equivalence between the electronic and the paper worlds. It gives the Minister for Public Enterprise the power to place the registration of any Irish Internet domain names on a statutory basis. The two-letter code currently assigned to Ireland for domain names is &ldquo;.ie&rdquo;. It is not clear at this stage whether such regulations will by implemented. However, it is felt prudent to provide for the power to do so at this stage.</P>
    <P>A top level domain name is a national resource which should be managed in both the public interest and in the interests of the Internet community. It is important to tackle the abuse of the domain name system such as cybersquatting. The Bill will ensure that control mechanisms can be put in place, if necessary, at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>E-government can play a role in supporting the new digital revolution and benefits can be achieved. These new technologies are transforming the way Departments and agencies interact with citizens. The use of these new technology systems has the potential to improve the way in which government delivers its services, both in terms of speed and efficiency. Effective use of websites and e-mail has the capacity to bring government closer to citizens. The Electronic Commerce Bill will pave the way for the acceleration of public services on-line.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is well advanced in preparing these new services. The Companies Office is well prepared for the roll out of web-based services. We are also building an electronic information desk for business, connecting all Government services and information which business requires. In the <Col N="1025" /> wider public service, the Revenue on-line service for processing a range of tax returns will be available in the autumn and the Land Registry on-line service was launched in October last. More recently, my Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, sought to stretch the ambitions of local authorities by making the best use of changing technology. He put in place a £5 million fund to accelerate change. One practical measure will be that planning applications will be available on-line, including maps, ensuring that citizens will be able to track the progress of planning applications on-line.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to asserting its leadership role in this new digital economy by accelerating the move towards the on-line delivery of public services. In this day and age it should no longer be necessary for citizens to access government services, both central and local, by being passed around from office to office. The technology is now available to us and will be used for the benefit of all citizens. It will be used to bring government closer to the people. This legislation will most certainly help in this task.</P>
    <P>That the Bill was agreed last November is a tribute to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke who tabled it, and the officials in her Department. It is a broad-ranging Bill. I congratulate her for the work she has done and thank her and her Department for co-operating with my Department to ensure that the Bill would be current, relevant and of practical benefit to the people immediately and in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>E-commerce is an exciting new opportunity for all enterprises from the local corner store to the large software companies. A couple of years ago few business people had given much thought to the implications of the Internet. Suddenly e-business is everywhere. Even small shops and post offices are involved. Earlier Deputy O'Shea mentioned this. I hope all small post offices, which are a cause of concern for everybody, will become involved in e-commerce in order that they will be able to handle banking, the planning permissions to which the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, referred, and all kinds of problems with State agencies. It is the Government's job to make sure that all State agencies, the county councils, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Health and Children, the health boards, etc., are geared for e-commerce so that people who <Col N="1026" /> want to use the Internet to conduct business or access services will be able to do so.</P>
      <P>My big concern is the same as that of most people, that people are afraid of change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the big worry. As one gets older one wants to leave things as they are. The young people have no worries because they have recently come through the educational system. My children can operate the Internet. They have no difficulty with it and they do not have any worries about it. It is people who have been in business for many years who are worried. I was glad to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, state that he would provide funding for retraining to enable more people to access whatever information they want from whatever quarter. People must be encouraged and helped to enter into this new era in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Many people are worried by what happened last week when one person in a far corner of the world sent a message by e-mail and the system throughout the world was upset. A man who visited my clinic rightly pointed out that the Internet and e-mail is all very well but some day somebody will be able to connect to another person's bank account and withdraw money or private information. Theft is the big danger. I am glad the Bill is before the Dáil. I expect that over the coming years we will see many more such Bills. This is a new information age and we will see an ever increasing amount of technology being introduced. As a result, we will see more problems like those of last week or the week before, where people will be able to gain access to and extract people's private information. That is what most worries people.</P>
      <P>Electronic commerce is worth approximately £14 billion. By the year 2001, it is expected that it will be worth £400 billion. We are fortunate in having well educated young people who are able to take on any challenge. I want Ireland to be the e-commerce capital of Europe. We should be ready for the challenge of e-commerce and when I listen to the proposals of the Minister and Minister of State I am convinced that we are ready it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Textiles was one of the biggest industries in Ireland 20 years ago. My father worked for Westport Textiles, which was opened by Seán Lemass, from the day the factory opened until it closed. From that day he was out of employment. There were textile factories in every corner of Ireland. At present, American companies are establishing the importance of e-commerce as the new industry in the Irish economy. Our great worry is that the industry might suffer a decline or that some new invention will make it obsolete. People are concerned at the speed of our economic growth and at the rate of change in our society. I ask the Government to take every possible step to ensure the security of all information stored electronically. It is difficult to believe what happened recently when an individual in a distant country <Col N="1027" /> came close to destroying the Internet throughout the world and caused great anxiety to many people who had invested huge amounts of money in IT equipment and who were worried that important information might be lost.</P>
    <P>Many people use the Internet for shopping. What effect will this trend have on our economy? In the past, small businesses carried on their trade, paid taxes to the Government and rates to local authorities. What is the situation with regard to shopping from foreign suppliers <i>via</i> the Internet? Deputy Yates mentioned the question of protection for purchasers of goods through the Internet. We see advertisements nightly on television channels for goods which can be bought by this method. The problems which will arise from this trade must be faced in the future. There is considerable concern that important information which is stored electronically may be accessed by criminals.</P>
    <P>We must encourage small business people who have received very little assistance from the State. Large companies receive various grants but small business people have not ever received adequate support from the State. The Government should assist them to use the Internet and encourage them in using e-commerce. The county enterprise boards do much good work but they must do more to retrain small business people for e-commerce which will be the industry of the future. Anyone who cannot use the new technology will be left behind. Young people have no difficulty with the new forms of technology but older people require help.</P>
    <P>Electronic commerce could greatly help small rural post offices. Within the past week the small village of Drummin, in County Mayo, lost its post office. The Minister knows the village because she visited it as Minister for Education. The post office was a lifeline for the village.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did no one come forward to take over the post office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. That was the problem. I cannot blame the Government for what happened. The vacancy was advertised on three different occasions. The Government could, however, do something to deal with the problem of salaries for sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses. No one can be expected to work for five and half days per week in a small rural post office for less than £60 per week. The volume of trade was not sufficient to make running the post office worthwhile. If small rural post offices could be allowed to provide other services, such as banking or accepting planning applications on behalf of local authorities, they could be made viable. If rural communities are to survive, services must be provided. Small rural communities must be helped to make use of modern electronic technology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Fleming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> I welcome the introduction of the Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000. It shows that the Government is computer literate and capable of developing the legislative infrastructure at the pace at which providers of information and communications technology infrastructure are working. My message for those in the high technology industry is that we will roll out the legal framework for the e-world as fast as they can roll out the technology.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government can claim to be a world leader in the information age. The recently published popular science book, <i>The Code Book </i>by the English author, Simon Singh, describes the history of codes and ciphers up to the age of encryption for electronic commerce. Only two world leaders merit any mention in <i>The Code </i>Book. They are Bill Clinton and Bertie Ahern, for their historic first signing by electronic means of an international agreement in Dublin during President Clinton's most recent visit to Ireland. This Bill is necessary to provide the legal framework in which we can all sign such agreements electronically, secure in the knowledge of privacy and of legal recognition of the resulting contract.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, I was the first candidate for Dáil Éireann to put up a campaign website. Senator O'Toole was ahead of me but I led the Dáil into the Internet. I recently changed my website to keep up with my colleagues who have introduced them. As a small businessman I have been committed to the world of e-commerce since 1996. A business person cannot afford to ignore the market place. The Internet, and specifically the world-wide web part, has become more than an advertising medium. It is a genuine market place where a person can buy and sell goods and services. Electronic commerce means money changing hands. Like any financial dealings, e-commerce requires a legal and regulatory framework. The Bill also has implications for the law and will put an end to the kind of farce we have had in the courts where, for example, computer generated parking summonses have been rejected in certain District Courts as having no legal authority.</P>
    <P>I will make a number of general points about the approach we are taking in the field of electronic commerce. Electronic commerce depends on secure encryption. The encoding of electronic documents is essential to ensure that not only are they read by those who are supposed to read them, but more importantly, that they are not tampered with in transit so that they can be certified to come from the person they say they come from and not somebody else. That is why one can ensure that when one types credit card information into the computer only the person who is supposed to receive the information will do so and that when it is received he or she can trust it has been sent by the owner of the credit card.</P>
    <P>Other countries have taken a backward approach to encryption. One would expect countries who have not had a history of democracy or who are currently dictatorships, like China, to be <Col N="1029" /> mistrustful of their citizens and to try to limit their privacy or eavesdrop on their correspondence. However, it is a surprise when democracies take this approach. Among these the US, acting principally under the influence of the National Security Agency, the NSA, is the leading opponent of the ability of so-called strong encryption technology. It has made repeated attempts to limit the export of such technology from its own country and it denies it to its citizens. That is its sovereign right, but interfering in the exports of other countries with more liberal encryption regimes is not. Acting under the same influence from its intelligence agencies, Britain takes a similar if less intolerant line.</P>
    <P>It is hardly surprising that the US and UK Governments have been found to be eavesdropping on the electronic traffic of other countries through the Echelon system, which is essentially a tool of the English speaking countries. It is almost certainly used to spy on the commercial correspondence of other countries to the advantage of the major companies in the Echelon countries. This practice is a US-European activity.</P>
    <P>We need the strongest encryption technology to protect ourselves from the unacceptable face of industrial espionage. The Bill will ensure that most of Ireland will have access to the best electronic security. We will have access to encryption and, more importantly, the law will protect our right to hold on to the keys of this encryption.</P>
    <P>In the US, at the behest of the NSA, the concept of key escrow has long been debated. The &ldquo;key&rdquo; is the coding information which enables the coded message to be read while &ldquo;escrow&rdquo; is an old word describing a legal procedure in which a document or a key, for example, is deposited with a trusted third party to be released to another party under certain conditions. In key escrow the US Government was considering &ndash; I am not certain of the precise status of the US proposals at present &ndash; the idea that a person sending a secure electronic commerce document or other encrypted message would be legally required to hand the key for the message over to what would effectively be a Government accessible agency so that the Government or its agents could read the message if it choose to. This Bill excludes that concept in section 26. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Commercial interests will not base themselves in countries which have defective legal frameworks and protections for electronic commerce. The US and UK Governments are shooting themselves in the foot by restricting encryption and the right to privacy. It is hard to believe that such leading countries could impose sanctions on their development. As a country with a large English speaking, technically competent work force there is an opportunity for us here.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specifics of the Bill, section 9 deals with electronic commerce and provides that the provisions will have legal effect. This is a wide ranging section which brings the law into the 21st century. There are exceptions covering wills, con<Col N="1030" /> veyancing documents, affidavits or sworn declarations and court documents, but it is left open to the Minister to extend electronic documentation to these areas when the technology is up to the job.</P>
    <P>Section 12 allows members of the public to supply information by electronic means. Again, this is subject to reasonable exceptions. I am informed that the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, had this vision in the late 1980s, long before most people had heard of Al Gore. However, this section needs to be looked at in the context of the proposal to use electronic voting machines.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 provide for the use of electronic signatures to be used while section 15 makes similar provision for the use of electronic seals. Section 16 provides for the use of electronic documents as the original document and section 17 provides for electronic documents to be used as the copy for archiving and production for legal purposes. Section 18 provides for the use of electronic contracts.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 19, which provides for the attribution of the origin of the electronic correspondences and replies to them. Section 21 defines in law when the correspondence is deemed to have been sent and delivered and to where. That is like establishing a kind of postal service, except it would be in cyber space rather than real space. Not many would be working in it.</P>
    <P>Section 22 allows electronic documents to be admissible in evidence. This has clear implications in libel law. Section 23 will reassure many people. It means that nobody is forced to use electronic documents. Will this give people the right to insist on a paper ballot paper rather than using electronic voting machines? There is a need to resolve this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 24 will outlaw electronic fraud and section 25 gives the Garda powers of investigation. Section 26 sets out the most important protection of citizens' rights in the Bill. I commend the Government, especially the Minister, on its courage and foresight in framing this provision. It excludes key escrow, which means that one's privacy is one's right.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 regulate the certification service providers and they must be carefully considered on Committee Stage. These are the notaries public of the Internet.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is of great current interest as it regulates the Irish domain name registration. This is basically the Irish web equivalent of the telephone book. Many Members would wish that we controlled the US dot.com domain also as we have witnessed wholesale abuse of this register. An international treaty is urgently needed to withdraw the licence to use a domain name by an owner who, for example, permits libellous, indecent or blasphemous matters to be distributed on a site. I am sure this would solve the problem recently referred to by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> In commending the Bill I appeal to the committee dealing with it to get good legal and information technology advice and to scrutinise the Bill carefully as it is of immense importance in the protection of commerce. I again commend the Minister for introducing it to the House so swiftly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is timely that it should be before the Dáil for consideration. I was pleased to receive today in the post a document from the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland which deals with an extensive survey by it on the small and medium enterprises dealing with the question of electronic commerce. We could usefully spend time studying it before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We need to put e-commerce on a sound and secure footing. This is enabling legislation for that. It is the first in what will be a series of important legislative measures. In the years and decades ahead many further legislative provisions on e-commerce will be introduced.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that the Government is playing its part in relation to e-commerce and in doing business with the community on-line. The Revenue has outstanding facilities in this regard. The Land Registry has recently launched an initiative with regard to its dealings.</P>

      <P>&ndash;noting the Government's failure to persuade or require Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to avail of the opportunity to explain his actions in regard to the Sheedy affair to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;noting the unusual provisions of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1999</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" />&ndash;condemns the appointment of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty by the Minister for Finance to the post of vice-president of the European Investment Bank.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposes this motion because we regard Mr. O'Flaherty as an unsuitable person to fill this position. Mr. O'Flaherty is an eminent jurist &ndash; his knowledge of the law is probably unequalled in this State &ndash; and much has been made by Government spokespersons of his academic qualifications. Despite his qualifications, however, Fine Gael believes he is an unsuitable person for this position and his unsuitability arises from the role he played in the Sheedy affair.</P>
    <P>In October 1997 Mr. Philip Sheedy was jailed for four years, having been found guilty of driving while drunk and causing the death of Mrs. Anne Ryan, a married woman with two young children, resident in Tallaght. Mrs. Ryan was taking her children to the swimming pool. Mr. Sheedy's car shot across one of the Tallaght roundabouts, became airborne and landed on top of the family car. Mrs. Ryan died in front of her children. As a consequence of the conviction, Mr. Sheedy spent six months in Mountjoy and was then transferred to Shelton Abbey.</P>
    <P>In October 1998 Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, then a judge of the Supreme Court, met a young neighbour of his, Mr. Ken Anderson, and also Mr. Sheedy's sister from Donnybrook. They acquainted him with the plight of Mr. Philip Sheedy and he promised that he would see what he could do. On 14 October 1998 Mr. Joe Burke, a close and long-time friend and political associate of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, visited Mr. Sheedy in Shelton Abbey. Some weeks later Mr. Sheedy's case was relisted and on 12 November 1998 he was released from prison on the orders of Mr. Justice Kelly. He had served an unprecedented one year of a four year sentence.</P>
    <P>He was wrongly released from custody in a case which was wrongly listed, in the wrong court, before the wrong judge and with no proper notice to the DPP, the Garda Síochána or the Ryan family. Some time later Mr. Ryan, the bereaved husband of the late Anne Ryan, saw Mr. Sheedy going about his business in Tallaght. Mr. Sheedy's release was raised in the press and with individual Deputies, and a political furore followed.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights considered the matter. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform conducted an inquiry into the courts division of his Department and very soon two judges were involved. When the Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, was asked by the Government to conduct an inquiry into the affair, he acted quickly. The Hamilton report was made available to the Government on 14 April 1999. The report of the Chief Justice was sent to the committee on 16 April. The committee also received a letter from Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty offering to appear voluntarily before the committee.</P>
    <P>On 17 April, however, despite assurances given <Col N="1033" /> on RTE and to the press, Mr. Justice O'Flaherty resigned and subsequently refused to appear before the committee. Later in the year the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue, introduced legislation to provide pensions for Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty and the other persons who had resigned as a consequence of the affair.</P>
    <P>One year later, on 19 May 2000, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty was nominated by the Government as vice-president of the European Investment Bank, a position which is the equivalent in salary and status to that of a European Commissioner, where Mr. O'Flaherty will earn almost £600,000 over the next four years. This is surely the greatest come-back since Lazarus and no one in Government or on behalf of the Government has made an attempt to explain what brought about Mr. O'Flaherty's extraordinary change of fortune. How can the Government justify the appointment of a person to such an exalted position whose actions had the country on the brink of a constitutional crisis just one year ago and who resigned under threat of impeachment by the very same Government? What hold has Mr. O'Flaherty on the Government to explain this significant appointment?</P>
    <P>The then Chief Justice, Mr. Hamilton, examined the Sheedy affair and he concluded that the case would not have been relisted and that Mr. Sheedy would not have been released were it not for the intervention of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty. He concluded that this intervention was inappropriate and unwise, that it left his motives and his actions open to misinterpretation and that it was, therefore, damaging to the administration of justice. One year later, how can the Government justify appointing Mr. O'Flaherty to the post he is now set to occupy, against the background of this criticism, in writing, of the then Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton? What hold has Mr. O'Flaherty on the Government which would lead it to appoint a former judge who acted unwisely and inappropriately and whose actions damaged the administration of justice?</P>
    <P>Mr. Liam Hamilton accepts that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty became involved in the Sheedy case in the spirit of humanitarian interest. Supreme Court judges are the guardians of the Constitution. They vindicate the constitutional rights of individual citizens. They are very familiar with the rights of citizens and sometimes those rights are in conflict. When the rights are in conflict, some take precedence over others. I suggest that in the Sheedy affair, Mr. O'Flaherty's humanitarian interest was faulty and the rights of the late Anne Ryan, her husband and her children should have taken precedence over the rights of the unfortunate Mr. Philip Sheedy. Yet despite all this, the Government saw fit to appoint Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty as vice-president of the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>Some time after his resignation, the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, came into the Dáil and promised that he would introduce legislation <Col N="1034" /> to provide pensions for the three persons who resigned. It is quite clear from his remarks on the record of the House that his expectation was that once pensions were provided, none of the parties involved, in particular Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, would take part in public life again. In that context, there was sympathy in this House for the pension provisions. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said on 5 May 1999:</P>
    <P>As to why the Government decided to pay pensions to the judges, it took the view that, from the information available, the errors of judgment by the three individuals, including these two individuals, were quite serious but took into account that all three had taken the honourable course by resigning and had collectively helped to avert a difficult if not unprecedented position, from a constitutional stand-point.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day acknowledged that there was a constitutional crisis, that the resignation avoided it and, as a kind of <i>quid pro quo, </i>pensions were provided to persons whose careers in public life were finished, and that was why they were so generous.</P>
    <P>I am sure others will speak about the pension Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty received, which was £40,000 per year, but according to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the estimated capital cost, the estimate given by the Department of Finance, was £699,000. One might have one's pension suspended on request for three or four years but the capital cost of £699,000 will not change. The generosity of the pension and the remarks made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform show that it was the view of the Government 12 months ago that Hugh O'Flaherty's service in public life was over and that he was being taken care of because he had not made it difficult for the Government. How can it be explained 12 months later that he is being given a post in Europe equivalent to that of a European Commissioner?</P>
    <P>The position of the Progressive Democrats in this affair is extraordinary. It was this issue that drove them closest to the brink when it arose in the House last year. The Taoiseach had not mentioned to the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, that he had made representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on behalf of Mr. Sheedy. She withdrew from Cabinet, sulked in her Department, briefed journalists that the Government was at risk and, ultimately, rejoined the Cabinet only when a deal was brokered between her and the Taoiseach by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, which involved a grovelling apology and an admission of culpability by the Taoiseach. Is this the same Deputy Harney who now sees no problem appointing Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to this position? Can she explain how events which almost brought down the Government last year are airbrushed from history to such an extent that one of the principal <Col N="1035" /> actors in the drama is being appointed to the European Investment Bank? To paraphrase the late Jim Kemmy, the Tánaiste was Mighty Mouse last year but looks very like Mickey Mouse this year.</P>
    <P>When the Progressive Democrats were founded under the leadership of Deputy O'Malley they had a sense of moral purpose and the necessary sense of moral outrage to accompany it. They have become a pale shadow of their former selves. Rather than being defenders of the Republic they have become posers, soundbiters and playseekers. Their epitaph will be very short &ndash;&ldquo;Founded by Desmond O'Malley in 1985, buried by Mary Harney in 2000 AD&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How can the Tánaiste possibly justify the moral cowardice of her position? Is it any wonder that even her most loyal supporters are dismayed? Is it any wonder that her membership in the constituencies is disappearing like froth on the river? The Progressive Democrats are always in difficulty when the Attorney General, Mr. Michael McDowell, holds a significant position. He is a curious mixture of academic brilliance and flawed political judgment.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste should inform the House if the Attorney General has influenced her in the acceptance of this appointment. There is no explanation which could possibly justify the contrast between the position taken by the Tánaiste last year and the position taken last week. If she has an explanation she should come into the House and offer it to us. The Tánaiste's position is even more difficult to understand when it is recalled that the late Mrs. Anne Ryan was a constituent of hers.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and his spin doctors are keeping a very low profile in this affair. There is a pretence that this appointment is the sole responsibility of the Minister for Finance and that other Ministers, including the Taoiseach, were only involved on the periphery and simply asked if they had any objections. <i>De jure</i>, the issue is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance but as every person who has ever served in Cabinet knows the <i>de facto </i>position is very different. Appointments of this magnitude are the preserve of the Taoiseach and only made after detailed consultations and discussions between the parties in Government.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is central to this appointment and may have been central to other events in the Sheedy affair. The Taoiseach has confirmed that he made representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on behalf of Mr. Sheedy. It has been confirmed that Mr. Joe Burke, a close associate of the Taoiseach, retained the architectural services of Mr. Sheedy <Col N="1036" /> and visited him in Shelton Abbey a few weeks before his release. It has also been confirmed that Miss Celia Larkin who at the time ran the Taoiseach's constituency office, visited the O'Flaherty family on Mr. O'Flaherty's resignation. There is no evidence that any representations were made by the Taoiseach or anyone on his behalf to Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty on behalf of Mr. Sheedy. It is a fact however that Mr. O'Flaherty's appointment has already stoked the flames of rumour and fanned the fires of cynicism and the Taoiseach must have been aware that this would be a consequence when he sought to appoint Mr. O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank.</P>
      <P>This is a public scandal, as Senator Keogh said rightly. At a time when revelations at the two tribunals of inquiry have undermined confidence in public life and the profession of politics has ethical questions hanging over it this appointment will reinforce cynicism and further convince the public that there is a golden circle which always arranges its affairs to suit its members who, whatever it is, will always get away it. This is an unwise and inappropriate appointment. It undermines standards in Government and this House. Those who wish to stand by the Republic should vote with Fine Gael tomorrow evening when we go through the lobbies.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has to some extent been a scapegoat in this affair but I wish to put some questions to him which he may answer in reply. Why is the Government appointing a person it considered impeaching 12 months ago as vice-president of the European Investment Bank? What qualifications in banking does Mr. O'Flaherty have? Is the Minister aware that all other vice-presidents of the European Investment Bank have banking experience? Who first mentioned Mr. O'Flaherty's name for this appointment? Were any other names considered? Were any representations made to the Taoiseach or any other Minister to appoint Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty? Did the Minister receive any representations from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or any of his Cabinet colleagues asking him to nominate Mr. O'Flaherty? When he consulted his Cabinet colleagues did anyone object? Was a deal done with the Progressive Democrats on the basis that if they agreed to the appointment their nominee would be appointed to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development? Was any consideration given to the Sheedy affair in the context of the appointment? What briefing was given to the representatives of the Danish and Greek Governments? Was the briefing in writing or verbal? By whom was it given and to whom? I would like the Minister to address these important questions to enable us understand the thinking of the Government when it chose to appoint Mr. O'Flaherty to this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an appalling Government. Scandal follows scandal. The common factor is that at the centre of each scandal there seems to be a Fianna Fáil personality. In three years we have moved from the Haughey affair to the Burke affair, <Col N="1037" /> Flynn affair, Ellis affair, Sheedy affair and Foley affair. Apart from wringing her hands in dismay, the Tánaiste refuses to take action and continues to prop up an incompetent sleaze-ridden Administration.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has had several chances. He has promised to restore ethics to public life but we lurch along an ever downward slope where unethical behaviour seems to be part of the culture of the Fianna Fáil Party. The Taoiseach is always promising and never acting. The public is sick of it, sick of the ducking, weaving, diving, forgetting and procrastination. Tomorrow night the House will sink to a new low when the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste drag their reluctant backbenchers through the lobbies in support of an appointment that none of them can justify, even to themselves.</P>

        <b>:</b> Friday last was payback time for Hugh O'Flaherty and the key question is, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  I have heard the expression &ldquo;done deal&rdquo; used more than once in the last few days to describe this latest scandal. It was a done deal from the moment Mr. O'Flaherty dug in his heels and decided that he was not going to resign his Supreme Court position. It was a done deal because Mr. O'Flaherty had a tale to tell, a tale that had not come out and has not come out and a tale that could only be suppressed in the best Fianna Fáil tradition of resorting to its favourite instrument of political patronage by having poor Mr. O'Flaherty looked after.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> What hold has Mr. O'Flaherty on Fianna Fáil and on whom in Fianna Fáil that he has had to be rewarded with a European job with a salary of over three and a half times his generous £40,000 judicial pension? On numerous occasions, Fianna Fáil has shown utter contempt for the intelligence of the Irish people. It would be difficult, however, to find a more contemptuous or arrogant act than the appointment of Mr. O'Flaherty as vice-president of the European Investment Bank. Mr. O'Flaherty took an oath on taking office as Supreme Court judge in which he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the presence of Almighty God I, do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my <Col N="1038" /> knowledge and power execute the office of Judge without fear or favour, affection or ill-will towards any man, and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws. May God direct and sustain me.</P>
    <P>In the Sheedy affair, Mr. O'Flaherty drove a coach and four through his judicial oath of office. In spite of the oath, he showed quite extraordinary favour and affection towards Philip Sheedy. Not alone did he allow himself as a senior judicial figure to be approached on Mr. Sheedy's behalf &ndash; something a judge must never do and which flouts his very oath of office &ndash; he was responsible for setting in train a conspiracy and a scheme that was illegal and unconstitutional to have Mr. Sheedy illegally released from jail and, in so doing, he deliberately subverted the Constitution.</P>
    <P>According to Mr. O'Flaherty, he recalled a similar case over which he presided in the Court of Criminal Appeal and which he felt might assist the early release of Mr. Sheedy. The case in question was the DPP <i>v</i> McDonald. This is a totally misleading and fallacious argument and is nothing other than a transparent fig leaf which holds no water. The DPP <i>v</i> McDonald had nothing to do with reviewing sentences or relisting cases. It was not a reviewed sentence but an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and had no relevance to the Sheedy case.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Flaherty subsequently summoned the county registrar to his judicial chambers. He mentioned the Sheedy case to him and suggested to Mr. Quinlan that it might be possible to have the case relisted in the Circuit Court. Mr. Quinlan, secure in the knowledge that he had the support and encouragement of one of the top judges on the bench, undertook to make the arrangements to have the Sheedy case returned to the Circuit Court. Small wonder that his reply to a query from Mr. Sheedy's solicitor as to what was going on elicited the comment, &ldquo;You don't want to know&rdquo;. The rest is history.</P>
    <P>The case was wrongly listed. It was heard by Judge Cyril Kelly who should not have heard it. It was heard in the wrong court and should have been referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal or have gone for judicial review to the High Court. The case was called out of sequence &ndash; No. 1 instead of No. 19. Neither the DPP nor the Garda was notified. The case was called while the solicitor representing the Chief State Solicitor was out of court taking a telephone call. Judge Kelly pretended to the court that he had an up-to-date psychological report when this was patently not the case. The entire management of the case was illegal and unconstitutional from start to finish and Philip Sheedy was wrongly and illegally released from jail.</P>
    <P>Judge Kelly and Mr. Quinlan were forced to resign but the person who triggered the entire scandal was Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty. Had Mr. O'Flaherty not launched himself with so much enthusiasm into the Sheedy affair, had he not displayed such manifest judicial indiscretion, then <Col N="1039" /> Mr. Sheedy would not have been released and the probability is that the most unprecedented judicial scandal in the history of the State would have been avoided.</P>
    <P>Despite these facts, this is the man the Government has rewarded with one of the top and most lucrative positions in Europe. The courts are the cornerstone of democracy. By his actions and those of his colleague, Mr. Cyril Kelly, Mr. O'Flaherty has done irreparable damage to public confidence in the courts yet the Government is about to reward him with an annual salary of £147,000 and all the attendant perks. Mr. O'Flaherty wrote to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and offered to tell all but subsequently refused to come before the committee on the pretext that he was constitutionally prohibited. This is the man the Government is now going to reward with a £588,000 salary over a four year period on top of his judicial pension.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 16 April 1999, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the instruction of the Government, wrote to Hugh O'Flaherty and stated that the Government had decided at its meeting of that morning to forward the report of the Chief Justice to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The Minister went on to state that he had been asked to advise Mr. O'Flaherty that the Government would consider at its meeting of the following Tuesday, proposing resolutions for the consideration of the two Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to Article 35.4.1 for Mr. O'Flaherty's removal on the grounds that the facts admitted to the Chief Justice or established by him in his report amounted to misbehaviour within the meaning of the said provision of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This was a situation in which Mr. O'Flaherty, a Supreme Court judge and a leading contender for the position of Chief Justice which was shortly to become vacant, was given a clear ultimatum by the Government to resign within four days for abusing his position and for stated misbehaviour or else the Government was going to have him unceremoniously booted from office. However, 13 months later the man deemed by the Government to be unfit and unworthy to be allowed to continue as a judge of the law courts is elevated to a top banking position where, presumably, a certain amount of judicial discretion will be involved.</P>
    <P>The report of the Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, made Mr. O'Flaherty's position as Supreme Court judge totally untenable. Mr. Hamilton, a senior judicial colleague who sat and served with Mr. O'Flaherty for many years, stated in the coldest possible terms that his colleague's intervention in the Sheedy affair was inappropriate and unwise. He could have gone further and stated that it was illegal and unconstitutional. However, his remarks were tantamount to saying so when he concluded that Mr. O'Flaherty's <Col N="1040" /> action was damaging to the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Can one imagine a situation in which a judge who is solemnly and constitutionally obliged to administer justice is denounced by a colleague because his actions damaged the administration of the justice system he is supposed to uphold and maintain? In the 80 year history of the State a Supreme Court judge had never been forced to resign, yet this is the man the Government wants this House and the people to regard as competent and fit to hold an office with a much higher rate of pay than the position from which he was forced to resign.</P>
    <P>What is the real reason the Government stuck its neck out on this issue? Philip Sheedy was obviously somebody very special. Anyone whose early release from prison could have created the kind of constitutional convulsion which led to the fall of two well connected Fianna Fáil judges and a well connected Fianna Fáil county registrar is no ordinary individual. There is, of course, the Fianna Fáil agenda which runs through the case: Deputy Brian Lenihan's initial representations on behalf of Mr. Sheedy; Senator Don Lydon's stale psychological report; the Taoiseach's forever friend, builder Joe Burke, who visited Mr. Sheedy in Shelton Abbey prison, who had a business relationship with Mr. Sheedy and who was to be a witness in a court case in which Mr. Burke was involved and the Taoiseach's representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform looking for day release for Mr. Sheedy. The whole saga is riddled with politics and questions which must now be answered.</P>
    <P>This is not a case of unwarranted curiosity but of the public interest and the integrity of the judicial system. It is totally wrong to reinstate Mr. O'Flaherty to public office without insisting that he explain the full circumstances that led to his exit in disgrace from his previous public office. On 16 April, Mr. O'Flaherty was prepared to make a statement to the joint Oireachtas committee and to answer any and all questions surrounding the case. However, on 5 May he argued that the Constitution did not permit him to do so. Mr. O'Flaherty must think the people are fools. If there was no constitutional impediment on 16 April there was none on 5 May.</P>
    <P>Whatever about Mr. Kelly's position and the constitutional separation of powers, because he was, after all, sitting on the Bench and had heard the case, all the legal advice is to the effect that there was no constitutional problem with Mr. O'Flaherty coming before the committee. When he met Mr. Ken Anderson and Philip Sheedy's sister regarding the Sheedy case he was not exercising a judicial function but was exercising his dog in Herbert Park.</P>
    <P>The manner in which Deputy Harney and the Progressive Democrats are prepared to buy into this project has shocked ordinary decent people and elected members of that party. As Deputy Noonan said, this time last year the Progressive Democrats engaged in a Mexican stand-off <Col N="1041" /> because the Taoiseach had deceived the Tánaiste about his involvement and actions in the Sheedy affair. For several hours she and her party colleagues barricaded themselves behind closed doors in their Molesworth Street offices and continued to sulk until such time as the Taoiseach apologised to them. Now with Sheedy revisited she is prepared to back possibly the most scandalous act of political patronage and nepotism, which it is, because one must realise that Mr. O'Flaherty was very much part of the Fianna Fáil family.</P>

        <b>: </b>The promotion of somebody to high office as a representative, a delegate or an ambassador of this country who was ignominiously drummed out of office a little over a year ago is politically indefensible. Nobody expects much from Fianna Fáil in terms of moral rectitude, ethics or probity. Fianna Fáil standards are variable, a little like a dimmer light switch that can be switched up or down depending on the circumstances or the atmosphere at the time.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that Fianna Fáil has only one core value, survival at all costs. The Progressive Democrats was supposed to be different &ndash; it was the mould breaker. It would like us to think it had values and standards, is different from Fianna Fáil and is the moral and political watchdog to keep this Fianna Fáil juggernaut on the straight and narrow. The days of huffing and puffing are now over. If the Tánaiste and her colleagues are not prepared to call a halt to this appointment, its political race is run and it deserves the public odium and political cost that will inevitably ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Investment Bank has made it abundantly clear there is no obstacle to the Government changing its mind on the appointment. Deputy O'Malley on 25 April 1999 expressed considerable concern at the Government proposal to reward the two judges with pensions. He felt the Government should not rush in with the pension legislation but wait for some weeks in the hope and expectation that some explanation would be forthcoming as to why these events happened. He said it was inexplicable that the people concerned acted as they did. That was what Deputy O'Malley said then. His hope was not realised. The Government bulldozed through this House and the Seanad £40,000 of an index-linked pension for life for Mr. O'Flaherty and no explanation was given as to why he did what he did in the Sheedy affair. Is Deputy O'Malley prepared to troop through the division lobbies tomorrow evening in craven capitulation behind the soldiers of destiny whom he reviled when he abandoned them as having no principles when he set up the Progressive Democrats? Does Deputy O'Malley still stand by the principles of the Republic? What has become of the Progressive Democrats' insistence on public accountability? If Deputy O'Malley does not <Col N="1042" /> have the principle to do the honourable thing in what is a watershed low in jobs for the boys, he and his colleagues should not dare to put a toe, let alone trespass, on the high moral ground again. They stand for absolutely nothing. They should take the only course of action open to them and rejoin Fianna Fáil because they have no legitimate entitlement to a separate, let alone independent, identity.</P>

      <P>I thank my party leader and Deputies Noonan and Jim Higgins for the opportunity to speak about the outrage of the honest decent people at this appointment. What annoys me intensely about the outrage expressed in newspaper editorials and by political correspondents is the qualification attached to it, that Hugh O'Flaherty is an eminent person, eminently qualified. Hugh O'Flaherty is not an eminent person. He is a small man. He was found to interfere with the course of justice. A sentence of four years was overturned by the interference of a man who should have known better and who political correspondents claim is eminently qualified. He is a shabby little man who acted in a shoddy manner. The Minister for Finance should not shake his head. That is a fact. If young Sheedy &ndash; I am very annoyed about the problems he caused &ndash; had not the courage to pay his debt to society, he certainly should not have appealed to Hugh O'Flaherty to spring him from jail and Hugh O'Flaherty should have known better than to interfere.</P>

      <P>Hugh O'Flaherty has struck at the core of our democracy. The cornerstone of our democracy is to uphold law and order and to have respect for the Judiciary and our courts. It does not surprise me that this shabby little man acted in that manner because he compounded his actions by taking a shabby little pension from this shoddy Government &ndash; outrage upon outrage. That pension was bulldozed through here by a majority made up of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Independents. Is it any wonder people are cynical?</P>
      <P>Imagine the outrage of a community if a cashier in a corner shop was found with her hand in the till and sacked and three months later was appointed manager of the local credit union. One might say that would be ridiculous, but that is no more ridiculous than Hugh O'Flaherty's appointment to the EIB by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not be surprised by this appointment. The Government's hallmark is the pro<Col N="1043" /> motion of wrongdoers. Mr. P. Flynn, a former EU Commissioner, had his hand in the till and £50,000 has been unaccounted for. The former Deputy Ray Burke, who had his hand in the till, was promoted to the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. There were also the cases of Deputies John Ellis, Liam Lawlor and Dennis Foley and now there is the appointment of Hugh O'Flaherty. All of that has the blessing of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, leader of the declining democrats.</P>
    <P>Is this the last stand? Will the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, stand up like Custer and say &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;? He is the only one left to take the moral ground that was taken so righteously by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, when she sat in the seat now occupied by Deputy Howlin, and demanded heads on plates and a carving knife for far less. The Progressive Democrats are in disgrace. There is public outrage about this appointment. Young people are annoyed about politics and I am not one bit surprised.</P>

What happens to the poor? They go to jail. Now we know what happens to the rich. They go to Europe and get paid £140,000 a year. There must be law and order and the law must be applied equally.</P>
      <P>I do not like to be critical of anybody, particularly of a person's family. This is a bad night for politics and politicians and the people do not have much time for politics or politicians. Why was this man appointed to this position? I will not get an answer to that question from the Minister for Finance. We will probably have to wait another few years, as in the case of the tribunals, to find out the truth. We all know why he was appointed, but we will not say so until we learn the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group of people in this House, the Progressive Democrats, upset me. Half the members of that party say they are upset and annoyed by this appointment and the other half say they agree to it. The half who do not agree with the Government appointee will have an opportunity tomorrow night to walk through the lobby with Fine Gael, Labour and whatever decent TDs are left in this House. I cannot depend on the Independents to join us because they have no backbone. They will not let down the Government. We depended on the Tánaiste and the Progressive Democrats because they were the moral voice of the country. They told us in this House that when they got into Government, they would keep an eye on Fianna Fáil and on the Government. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, did not keep an eye on Fianna Fáil last week when she allowed this appointment. The people are outraged by it. They believe there are two laws in this State, one for <Col N="1044" /> the rich and one for the poor, and we know what has happened.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the nomination of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty by the Minister for Finance for appointment by the board of governors to a post of vice-president of the European Investment Bank.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that the Government regards the European Investment Bank as a most important organ of the European Union, with the potential to make a decisive contribution to advancing the Union's economic and social goals and to confront the challenges of future enlargement. In view of this and that under the rotation system that operates within the constituency we share with Greece and Denmark whereby Ireland is represented on the management committee for four years in 12, it is of paramount importance that a person of the highest calibre is put forward for this position.</P>
      <P>The decision to nominate Mr. O'Flaherty was made on the basis of the qualities of the person who would be able to do a good job for the European Investment Bank over the next four years. I assure Deputies it was his outstanding qualifications and wide legal experience which were decisive in his nomination.</P>
      <P>The controversy that surrounded Mr. O'Flaherty's departure from public office last year should not be allowed to obscure a record of long and distinguished service to his profession &ndash; 30 years of practice at the Bar and almost a decade sitting in the highest court of the State. At European level, let alone at national level, there are few people who could bring such experience and talents to bear on the position in the bank. It will bring credit to Ireland that we can provide a European institution with yet another personage of such intellect, qualifications and experience.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that before making the nomination I had, in the normal way, consulted extensively with my colleagues in Government. The governors from the two EU member states which, with Ireland, take turns to nominate a vice-president to the bank, Denmark and Greece, have also been consulted. Mr. O'Flaherty has been put forward as our common candidate for the vacancy that will arise when the term of the Greek vice president expires on 5 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to outline a general background to the European Investment Bank, which will help the House to appreciate the importance of the job, why I felt we needed to choose a person of the highest calibre for such an appointment and why <Col N="1045" /> Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty is suitable to fill such an important post. The European Investment Bank was established by the Treaty of Rome in 1958. The members of the European Investment Bank are the member states of the European Union which have all subscribed to the bank's capital. Ireland became a member on our entry into the European Economic Community in 1973.</P>
    <P>The European Investment Bank was set up as the European Union's financing institution, with its main task being to contribute, through its long-term loans, towards the integration, balanced development and economic and social cohesion of the member states of the Union. The European Investment Bank enjoys its legal personality and financial autonomy within the EU system. In performing its mission, the bank places emphasis, first and foremost, on promoting convergence and regional development, while at the same time supporting the other economic priorities defined by its board of governors.</P>
    <P>The House does not need to be reminded that in recent years the bank has been both imaginative and proactive in responding to the concerns of the ECOFIN Council and the Heads of State and Government. The objectives of the bank include: fostering the economic development of the less favoured regions; improving the European transport and telecommunications infrastructure; protecting the environment and promoting urban development; attaining Union energy policy objectives; enhancing the international competitiveness of European industry; supporting the activity of small and medium size industries; extending and modernising infrastructure in the health and education sectors with the objective of encouraging growth and employment and assisting urban renewal.</P>
    <P>Loans granted by the European Investment Bank in favour of economically sound projects, therefore, encompass a wide range of activities: communications networks; energy; protection of the natural and urban environment; the development of industry and services; and enhancement of health and education facilities. The European Investment Bank raises substantial volumes of funds on the markets, which it directs on the most favourable terms towards financing capital projects in accordance with the objectives of the European Union. Outside the European Union, the EIB implements the financial components of agreements concluded under European development aid and co-operation policies. European Investment Bank policies are established in close co-ordination with member states and the other institutions of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to have a full appreciation of the governance structures of the European Investment Bank. The management of the bank is structured around the board of governors, the management committee and the board of directors. The role each of these plays in the running of the institution is as follows. The board of governors consists of Ministers designated by each of the member states, usually ECOFIN <Col N="1046" /> Ministers. They represent the member states as shareholders in the bank. The board of governors lays down general directives on credit policy, approves the balance sheet, profit and loss account and annual report, decides on capital increases and appoints the members of the board of directors, the management committee and the audit committee. As Minister for Finance, I am the governor for Ireland and, in this capacity, I will attend the annual meeting in Luxembourg on 5 June.</P>
    <P>The board of directors ensures that the bank is managed in keeping with the provisions of the treaty and the statute and with the general directives laid down by the governors. It has the sole power to take decisions in respect of loans, guarantees and borrowings. Its members are appointed by the governors for a renewable period of five years following nomination by the member states and are responsible solely to the bank. Directors are non-resident and serve in a part-time capacity. The current director from Ireland is a senior official of my Department. Under the constituency rotation arrangement, Ireland also provides an alternate director when we hold neither a vice presidency nor a position on the bank's audit committee.</P>
    <P>The management committee of the European Investment Bank is composed of eight members, the president and seven vice-presidents. For the coming four years, one of the latter will be Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty when his nomination is endorsed by the governors of the bank. The management committee oversees the day-to-day operation of the EIB. All major decisions are taken collectively, but the lead responsibility for supervising the different activities of the bank is currently divided among its members. The management committee recommends decisions to directors and ensures that these are implemented. The president or, in his absence, one of the seven vice-presidents chairs the meetings of the board of directors. The members of the management committee are responsible solely to the bank. They are appointed by the board of governors on a proposal from the board of directors.</P>
    <P>The management committee operates in such a way as to give each vice-president responsibility for certain functions of the bank and also give them responsibility for certain geographical areas in which the bank operates. The Greek member of the management committee, who will be replaced by Mr. O'Flaherty, currently has responsibility for regional development policy, the Cohesion Fund, project evaluation and financing operations in Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Albania, Cyprus, Malta, Turkey and countries of former Yugoslavia. Obviously it will be a matter for the president and vice-presidents to decide the portfolio of work for Mr. O'Flaherty, having regard to his competencies and those of the other members of the management committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific functions of the bank which come under the remit of the various members of the management committee are manifold, but would typically include credit risk and loan portfolio monitoring, legal affairs and relations with the Court of Justice, accountancy and control of financial risks, relations with the European Investment Fund, information and communications policy, financial and treasury policies, capital markets, accounting policies, human resources, budget and relations with the European Parliament, trans-European networks, economic and financial studies, environmental policy issues, internal and external audit and information technology. It will be evident that the management committee can benefit from a diversity of skills and experience.</P>
      <P>A member of the management committee also serves as vice-governor of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, while the president is also governor of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and chairman of the supervisory board of the European Investment Fund.</P>
      <P>As I noted earlier, the position for which Mr. O'Flaherty has been nominated for appointment by the board of governors is one of seven vice- presidential positions and the vice-presidents, with the president, form the management committee of the bank. Decisions by the management committee are often taken on foot of consideration of financial and legal documentation that is both detailed and complex. Some of the projects the EIB approved recently include a framework agreement with the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, a 90 million facility for small projects in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary and a 120 million facility for smaller-scale investment schemes in Spain.</P>
      <P>The House does not need to be advised of how complex the legal arrangements affecting the conduct of business in the financial arena have become, nor of the pace of development of financial instruments and legal arrangements. In these days, no sensible banker travels without a lawyer in tow. Such is the reality of modern finance, and the European Investment Bank is often at the leading edge.</P>
      <P>A vice-president with the legal experience of Mr. O'Flaherty will be in a position to make a valuable contribution to the business of the management committee. The House will agree that the strength and depth of his legal background is outstanding. I know from personal experience and knowledge that the range of issues with which the European Investment Bank deals is very wide and the contracts with individual firms and organisations which it enters are extremely complex commercial and legal documents. Mr. O'Flaherty is uniquely qualified to make a contribution to the European Investment Bank not only on the portfolio which he will be allocated, but to the organisation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty is a man with an exceptional intellect, vast experience and extensive <Col N="1048" /> knowledge which will be invaluable to the bank. I have not heard any serious questioning of his ability to carry out his future role within the bank in a most effective manner.</P>

      <P>As a person who enjoyed a highly successful legal career that spanned 40 years and ranged from the position of barrister to serving as a Justice of the Supreme Court, he is without doubt well-equipped for the position in all its aspects.</P>
      <P>While serving as a barrister-at-law for the period 1959 to 1976, Mr. O'Flaherty carried out a wide-ranging practice involving constitutional, European, tort, contract, employment, company and revenue law. He advanced from there to serve as a senior counsel for a decade and a half from 1976 to the time of his appointment as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Ireland in 1990. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal on all matters relating to constitutional law and, additionally, the court hears appeals from the trial courts on various types of disputes. In this capacity he was the author of over 500 opinions affecting practically every area of law in every part of Irish life.</P>
      <P>Other positions he held during the course of his career include trustee of the Trier Academy of Law in Germany from 1990 to the present. This academy provides courses and seminars concerning the laws of the European Union for lawyers and others throughout Europe. He has lectured at Fordham Law School, Duquense University and the John Marshall Law School on all aspects of the law including Irish and international law and the inter-relationship between various systems of law. He was also the chairman of the National Archives Advisory Council during which he presided over the production of a strategic report dealing with the preservation and enhancement of the archival treasures of Ireland.</P>
      <P>From the wide-ranging and high level experiences to which I referred, it is clear that Mr. O'Flaherty is a very capable man and will undoubtedly be a valuable addition to the management committee of such an organisation. It is of paramount importance to choose a highly qualified person for the post and with his vast range of experience Mr. O'Flaherty will make a telling contribution to the management of the bank when facing the challenges that lie ahead for it in the climate of an expanding Europe as an important institution of the European Union.</P>

    <P>There has been a concern among Deputies and the public at the position whereby Mr. O'Flaherty <Col N="1049" /> would continue receiving a pension from public funds at the same time as earning a substantial salary from the European Investment Bank. In that regard, Mr. O'Flaherty has informed me today that it is his intention, on his appointment to the position in the European Investment Bank, to forego his entitlement to his judicial pension for the duration of his period of office in the bank. I commend Mr. O'Flaherty on his public-spirited response to the concerns being voiced.</P>

      <P>He is a wonderful person. Sadly, Mr. O'Flaherty was out for a walk and he met a neighbour of his who explained that he had a problem regarding the lady with him whose brother was Mr. Sheedy. Mr. O'Flaherty's offence, if it was one, was to say that he could not discuss the case with her but that she should talk to her lawyer because he thought a Bill had been passed a couple of years previously under which a person, if he or she was worried that an individual may take his or her life or something like that, could take action. He said to his neighbour to tell the lady to tell her lawyer to look at that law. That was all he did.</P>

I am a little disappointed that some of his many colleagues at the Bar and those who are retired did not speak out on his behalf and defend his good name.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I bring to the attention of the House the fact that we are not being asked to approve this nomination in the Government's amendment, we are simply asked to note it. The significance of that verb should not go unnoticed.</P>
      <P>I am sure that, when the decision to appoint Mr. O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank was being discussed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, the plight of the Ryan family and how they would react to Mr. O'Flaherty's elevation must have been discussed. It is impossible to see how it could not have arisen. Ultimately and unfortunately, concern about the Ryan family was considered to be of secondary importance to Fianna Fáil's key concern that one of their own, Hugh O'Flaherty, was looked after.</P>
      <P>In its essence, the Sheedy case was about two forms of justice and two different legal systems, one for the golden circle and another for other citizens. It is telling then that what may probably be the final act in this saga, the appointment of Mr. O'Flaherty last Friday, confirms that view. We do not know fully the circumstances in which Mr. Sheedy was released from prison or the motivation of those involved. It looks like we will never know, Deputy Briscoe notwithstanding. Even an Oireachtas committee could not get to the bottom of the matter. My party's view of Mr. O'Flaherty is coloured by his failure to account for his actions.</P>
      <P>Whatever benefit of the doubt I was prepared to give the Fianna Fáil Party last year disappeared on Friday. Only it is responsible for the construction put on last year's events by commentators, the Opposition and the public. Looking back on it, Friday's decision was sadly predictable. From the attempts by Fianna Fáil to exonerate both Judges Kelly and O'Flaherty to the now infamous dash to Herbert Park, the writing was on the wall.</P>
      <P>Just as I do not know enough about why Philip Sheedy was released from prison, neither do I know, nor will I ever know, if this deal was cooked up this time last year or whether comforting words and knowing nods sufficed at that time. However, every member of the public suspects that Friday's act was the final chapter of some kind of arrangement. The fact that no file exists in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the negotiations that took place officially with Judges Kelly and O'Flaherty only adds to the suspicion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we really being asked to believe that the Minister's starting position was that he found himself with a vacancy and searched for the most eligible and qualified candidate? I suspect the opposite is the case. He started with a candidate and searched for a well paid vacancy. Was every Minister given a similar instruction and the Mini<Col N="1056" /> ster for Finance merely the man who came up with the goods first? Technically, the decision to appoint may have been made by the Minister for Finance, but he made sure to secure approval from all his Government colleagues, although the Tánaiste has clearly lost touch with both her party and her constituency.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, executive responsibility lies with the Taoiseach. So much for the Taoiseach who presents himself as the common man. Like any true conservative, he disguises his special regard for the golden circle and the establishment by a folksy appeal to the public. However, one can scarcely believe that he could be so contemptuous of public concern. At the last election his party campaigned on a platform of &ldquo;People Before Politics&rdquo;. The true meaning of that slogan is now more than clear. It is the Taoiseach's people before politics. The Taoiseach's contempt for politics is unprecedented. He knows his party is the likely beneficiary of a phenomenon that will drive frustrated and disillusioned people from the polls and party politics.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's style is beginning to jar. A pattern of behaviour has been established with the Ray Burke affair, the Ansbacher saga, the Rennicks payment, the blank cheques and his indifference to the revelations about Deputy Foley. If the Taoiseach can get away with doing nothing, nothing will be done. From the implementation of the national development plan to planning the underground, overground or up in the air Luas, decision-making has ground to a halt. On the important issue of asylum seekers, we had to wait until the Taoiseach's visit to Australia before he chose to make an intervention. It is a pity he bothered to do so.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Fianna Fáil Party is the only party leader who has failed to produce proposals to resolve the crisis surrounding the funding of politics. He apparently wants the link between business and politics to stay and in an attempt to achieve his goal, he wants to park the issue in a committee for at least six months. Since his election to the office of Taoiseach, with the exception of Northern Ireland, leadership has been conspicuous only by its absence.</P>
    <P>I do not know Hugh O'Flaherty well. He seems to be regarded as a pleasant, intelligent and capable man. However, his refusal to account for or explain his actions to the Dáil last year has made him unsuitable for appointment to a critical public position, however consistent it might be with the Government's approach to European issues.</P>
    <P>However, tonight's debate is not about Mr. O'Flaherty but about the Taoiseach. It is about the loss of trust in a Taoiseach who, when it was expedient to do so, forced Mr. O'Flaherty to step aside last year following threats to impeach him. This is the same Taoiseach who resurrects him this year to an important post without any change in circumstances, save the passage of time. I have not been in politics for as long as Deputy Briscoe but I have been in it for some time during which I have seen some strokes pulled, but this, as Frank <Col N="1057" /> Cluskey used to say, is about the worst of them. The Government and the Taoiseach will reap their reward.</P>
    <P>A man who was forced out of judicial office to restore confidence in the system is now being rewarded by this appointment. His appointment to this post by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance has brought politics further into disrepute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to nominate the former Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty to the position of vice-president of the European Investment Bank indicates a Government without standards, values or any sense of political judgment. It indicates a Government which is arrogant, has no regard for people's opinion, has lost touch not only with its supporters but with its backbenchers and is in its dying days. The decision also clearly tells us that we have a Minister for Finance who has become so arrogant he can be contemptuous of public opinion.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, said that the amendment proposed by the Minister is interesting. It asks the Dáil to note, not support, commend or agree with, the nomination of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty. Although the Minister might respond that it is a <i>pro forma</i> action in that the assent of the House is not required, it is normal for the Executive to seek the assent and support of the House when there is a challenge to its decision. To merely note it is an indication of how weak is the ground on which the Minister for Finance perceives the Government to be standing.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Tánaiste to meekly endorse the decision to nominate Mr. O'Flaherty indicates that the Progressive Democrats has abandoned its self-proclaimed role as the watchdog of Fianna Fáil in Government and is now willing to serve out the remainder of this Government's term of office as a compliant lapdog for its senior partner.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has been a consistent opponent of many of the Progressive Democrats' policies since its inception, especially its right wing economic ones. However, like many people, I have always had a genuine and strong regard for the personal and political integrity of many members of the Progressive Democrats. On many occasions they have taken a stand for standards in office, sometimes at considerable cost to themselves. We all remember the striking &ldquo;standing by the Republic&rdquo; speech made in this House to which all of us could rally. It is difficult to believe a decision such as that being debated tonight would have been approved by the Progressive Democrats when Deputy O'Malley was leader of that party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanations offered by anonymous spokespersons for the Tánaiste that the Progressive Democrats &ldquo;could not oppose everything&rdquo; and that &ldquo;this was Fianna Fáil's call&rdquo; are just too feeble for words, too inadequate and pathetic to justify a response. We are informed that the Tánaiste has made herself unavailable for public <Col N="1058" /> comment or interview in respect of this matter&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;until she hears directly the views of her parliamentary party tomorrow. One would not have thought this would prove to be a major job.</P>
      <P>In May of last year the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, locked herself away in her Department for days on end and was willing to bring down the Government until the Taoiseach issued a statement of apology to her because she believed he had not honoured a commitment he had given to her that he would inform the Dáil that he had earlier made inquiries of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the Sheedy case. Who was the intermediary between the collapsing Government and the embattled Tánaiste locked in her ivory tower on that occasion? It happened to be the Minister for Finance, the author of the order which is the subject of this debate.</P>
      <P>When one reflects on the position that obtained last year, it is clear that the new Progressive Democrats order dictates that a personal snub to the Tánaiste is regarded as sufficient grounds to threaten to bring down the Government. On the other hand, it is obvious that a patently inappropriate appointment, which flies in the face of logic and public opinion and which will clearly do further significant damage to public confidence in the political system, to a senior European position is grounds merely for a helpless shrug of the shoulders from the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>At a time when the standing of politics and the political system has never been at a lower ebb, the last thing we need is an appointment of the nature proposed in the Government amendment. This appointment will inevitably give rise to further suspicion among the public of cronyism, secret deals and debts being repaid.</P>
      <P>Let us remember that just over 12 months ago Mr. O'Flaherty was forced to resign from the Supreme Court under the unprecedented threat of impeachment by the Dáil, a threat delivered not from these benches but in unambiguous terms in the letter authored by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on behalf of the Government which stated:</P>
      <P>I have been asked to advise you that the Government will consider, at its meeting next Tuesday, proposing resolutions for the consideration of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, pursuant to Article 35.4.1 for your removal on the grounds that the facts admitted to the Chief Justice or established by him in his report, amount to misbehaviour within the meaning of the said provision of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>That was the view expressed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to the apologia for a friend given by Deputy Briscoe which was <Col N="1059" /> couched, here and there, with a little innuendo. It was not, however, comments from the media or from these benches which led to the removal from office of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty last year; it was the unambiguous threat, authored by the Government, signed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and delivered to Mr. O'Flaherty, that demanded his resignation forthwith on pain of impeachment. It is like being in the twilight zone here this evening. People have forgotten history and changed the facts to suit the occasion. Are we all supposed to suffer from the same dementia and forget what occurred at the time?</P>
    <P>The threat issued by the Government was one of unprecedented seriousness. Never before in the almost 80 years of our independence has a Government felt it necessary to issue a similar threat. The letter, signed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was issued on foot of a report, which was itself unprecedented, from the Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, who found that the actions of his colleague, Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, in involving himself in the Sheedy case were &ldquo;inappropriate and unwise&rdquo; and were &ldquo;damaging to the administration of justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following that affair, in April 1999, Mr. O'Flaherty pronounced himself available to appear before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. He proffered the view, as an eminent member of the Judiciary, that there was no constitutional debar on his providing evidence to the committee. However, a month later when he had left office he suddenly indicated that, in his opinion, he was constitutionally debarred from giving evidence. As a serving member of the Supreme Court he felt there was no debar but one month later when he no longer held that office he found himself to be debarred. That is inexplicable.</P>
    <P>A mere 12 months ago we were in the midst of a serious political, legal and constitutional crisis in which Mr. O'Flaherty was a central figure. A year later, history is being rewritten. The criticisms made by the Chief Justice have been forgotten. Mr. O'Flaherty's U-turn in refusing to co-operate with a committee of the House following his resignation and his financial compensation package, which was rushed through the House, are to be ignored. He is now the innocent victim who did no wrong. The statement issued by the Department of Finance last Friday announcing his appointment to the European Investment Bank simply stated that Mr. O'Flaherty &ldquo;was a justice of the Supreme Court until 1999&rdquo;. Anyone who was not familiar with the story would conclude from the Minister for Finance's statement that Mr. O'Flaherty retired with the gold watch, after an uneventful career, with no questions left unanswered.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on the Sheedy case and its fallout on a number of occasions in this House. Each time I emphasised that while judicial resignations <Col N="1060" /> had been caused, reputations damaged and families put under stress, we should never lose sight of the fact that those who have suffered most are the members of the late Anne Ryan's family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I remarked on previous occasions, nothing could compensate the Ryan family for their loss but they had the right to expect that if and when the person who caused the action was charged, convicted and sentenced, then justice would be allowed to take its course. All that has happened to shake the legal system has flowed from what was clearly an attempt to ensure that justice did not take its normal course and that, in effect, the course of justice would be interfered with.</P>
      <P>The mess in which the Government now finds itself is entirely of its own making. There are many people in public life in this country &ndash; in politics, in administration and in the financial sector &ndash; who could have adequately filled the position in question. However, the Minister for Finance ignored these people and made a peculiar decision which has been endorsed by the Taoiseach and in respect of which the Tánaiste remains silent.</P>
      <P>No Government or Minister likes to have a decision reversed once it has been announced and placed in the public domain. However, it is clear that unless the decision made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is reversed it will do serious damage to our political system. Is there nobody on the Government benches who is prepared to shout &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for taking this matter as I am aware the Minister for Defence is overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a number of meetings with departmental officials and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to the provision of facilities for asylum seekers at Magee Barracks, Kildare, everyone in attendance highlighted the importance of the Magee Barracks site to the people of Kildare. It was stressed that the proposed integrated area plan which had been discussed with the Minister for Defence and public and community representatives as part of the sale <Col N="1061" /> of the barracks should not be delayed because of the proposed Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform development. It was endorsed by all present as being a vital part of the overall package devised by the people of Kildare. I attended meetings with all the interested groups and everyone was emphatic that the development of the barracks was vital to the progress of the town.</P>
    <P>Following last Wednesday's Question Time, a major cloud seems to hang over those proposals. In reply to a supplementary question in which I asked the Minister for Defence to give a commitment that the area plan, as envisaged in his meetings with public representatives in Kildare, would proceed, the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>I cannot state for certain that we will revert to the integrated area plans. It is a significant block of land ideally located in terms of the development of the town. I would like to be more optimistic and hope we would revert to the original plans but I cannot be sure.</P>
    <P>This is totally unacceptable. It is vitally important that the Ministers for Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform meet to clarify the position. They cannot undermine the plans which were enthusiastically drawn up by interested local groups as this will undermine their efforts to integrate the 300 Kosovar refugees and the 150 asylum seekers into the local community. They will see it as a stab in the back because, following the completion of all the meetings, everyone felt that the integrated plan and the facilitation of asylum seekers and refugees would go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>The Minister must immediately rectify the damage which has been done and state that the integrated plan will continue to be processed and that every effort will be made to arrange meetings with interested local groups and public representatives to develop it further. The people of Kildare have not been found wanting in regard to facilitating and working with the 300 Kosovar refugees who have lived in the town for a number of years. Furthermore, the town has taken 150 asylum seekers on board.</P>
    <P>The integrated plan and the development of the 20 acres which the Minister for Defence envisaged would be provided to the local community should not be put on hold because of this development. The people of Kildare saw the development of those 20 acres as part and parcel of their efforts to integrate asylum seekers and refugees in the town as they would then be in a position to provide sports and recreation facilities and the other facilities necessary for the town's development. The integrated plan was jeopardised by the Minister's statement last Wednesday and I hope the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will ensure that that cloud is lifted in order that the people of Kildare can work towards improving facilities and can continue to provide hospitality to refugees and asylum seekers in the town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the fact that the Minister for Defence is unable to be in the House this evening as he is overseas.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this matter and bringing it to the attention of the House and I welcome the opportunity to outline the present position with regard to the status of Magee Barracks, Kildare. The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which were considered surplus to military requirements. This decision was part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the context of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report. The Government remains fully committed to this important programme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that in excess of £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks. Most of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment. The proposed sale will provide prime sites to meet housing, commercial and industrial and other development needs in the areas concerned. In addition, 15% of the proceeds is to be devoted to community projects in the areas involved. The Minister initiated an extensive consultative process with local representatives and organisations on this aspect. The Government decision of 15 July 1998 identified Magee Barracks as one of the properties for disposal. The property comprises approximately 60 acres and occupies a most significant site dominating one side of Kildare town.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the local authority would like a mixed development on these lands in the interests of the town. In this connection, it was considered essential that a plan be drawn up which would have regard to the needs of the community to allow for an overall balanced development of the property to achieve its maximum potential. Accordingly, a tender competition was arranged for the appointment of independent consultants to prepare an area action plan in respect of the former barracks lands. A number of the proposals received were shortlisted and those consultants placed on the shortlist made presentations before a selection committee on 16 February 2000. On 14 April 1999 the Government agreed to the admission into the State of up to 1,000 refugees of ethnic Albanian origin who fled Kosovo. Consequent on this and arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, the Minister offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Magee Barracks was considered suitable for this purpose and 241 Kosovar refugees are currently accommodated in mobile homes in the barracks grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evacuation programme in 1999 for Kosovar refugees was always seen as a temporary measure. The refugees were given permission to remain in Ireland for one year. The United <Col N="1063" /> Nations High Commission for Refugees has now indicated that, for the vast majority of Kosovar refugees, there is no longer a need for temporary protection in host countries. The programme will, therefore, be gradually wound down and returning refugees will receive assistance to help them start the process of rebuilding their lives in Kosovo. The Government expects most refugees to return to Kosovo over the next few months. However, it is recognised that there may be individual cases of vulnerable refugees who may require protection for a further temporary period. Such cases will be looked at sympathetically by the Government. It is intended that, where refugees are given permission to remain for a further temporary period, they will move out of the existing reception centres into private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The question of making accommodation available for refugees and asylum seekers has been the subject of ongoing discussion between the Department of Defence and various Government agencies. In relation to the urgent need for accommodation for asylum seekers, the Government decided on 28 March 2000 that mobile home accommodation should be provided for asylum seekers in Magee Barracks. This accommodation would form part of the temporary accommodation arrangements to be put in place as an interim solution to the urgent need for the provision of such accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made an order under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993, exempting the provision of accommodation at Magee Barracks from planning procedures. This order was on the basis that such accommodation was required urgently and would be of a short-term duration. It was initially intended to make provision for 100 mobile homes. However, following consultations between representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and representatives from the local community, it was agreed that this number would be reduced to 50 mobile homes to accommodate approximately 200 people.</P>
    <P>Representatives from the Office of Public Works have also been in discussions with representatives from local residents' groups and I understand that agreement was reached on 18 May 2000 concerning boundary treatment, security and privacy issues. I understand that the community is now satisfied with these arrangements. The area to be used for the accommodation of asylum seekers at Magee Barracks is approximately 7.8 acres. As indicated to the House in response to questions last Wednesday, the Minister did not anticipate the problems which have arisen in relation to Magee Barracks.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked me to reiterate his appreciation of the co-operation of the community and public representatives in Kildare, notwithstanding their and the Minister's disappointment that he was unable to proceed with the area action plan <Col N="1064" /> at this time. We must be mindful of our broader national obligations. The Minister will keep the matter under review in the light of developments and will consult with the Deputies at the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending this debate. The price of lamb is again in freefall. It is now at £1.20 per pound and is expected to fall further. Two weeks ago lamb was £1.35 per pound. To compound the problem for Irish farmers, their French counterparts are getting £1.60 per pound or 40p more but Irish farmers are getting the same level of ewe premium.</P>
      <P>The first instalment of the 2000 ewe premium at £4.22 flat plus £4.71 or 90% of the rural world premium bears no relationship to the costs involved in rearing lambs. It is no wonder that 20% of Irish sheep farmers said in a recent opinion poll that they were getting out of sheep production. Why are they doing this? They see no future in the industry because there are major structural problems which the Minister does not appear to be capable of tackling. The only proposal put forward in the last few weeks was a possible rejig of the current sheep headage scheme, which suggests that the headage should be scrapped on all hogget ewes in hill and lowland flocks and should be increased for ewes. This is no more effective than rearranging the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic</i>.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to understand the plight of sheep farmers. He does not understand the problems that will beset Irish sheep farmers as a consequence of Agenda 2000. He has done almost nothing to provide a level playing pitch so Irish sheep farmers can make money from sheep production.</P>
      <P>A number of fundamental changes must take place if our 40,000 sheep farmers are to remain in business and compete. The retention period for the ewe premium scheme must be moved back to prevent the negative effect of hoggets coming onto the market at the same time spring lambs are offered for sale. It will have to be staggered in some way. The meat factories will have to improve. It is obvious that some profiteering is taking place. Bord Bia will have to do more to promote the image of Irish lamb at home and abroad. I welcome what happened this week but I cannot understand how French farmers can get 40p more per pound for their lamb. Something is wrong with the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules on extensification must be changed. We cannot play around with this any longer. If sheep are calculated as livestock units, they must be paid for and if they are not, they must be excluded. The stabiliser must be reduced or removed as the factors for its inception have now changed in that the number of ewes has dropped considerably across Europe. The method of calculation for the ewe premium scheme, based on the entire EU area, militates greatly against Irish <Col N="1065" /> farmers. The French farmer who received £1.60 per pound for his lambs today has a negative impact on the amount of money an Irish sheep farmer receives on his ewe premium. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>These are the problems and they are well known. The Government and Minister appear to be unable to grapple with them. Unless there is a major change there will be fewer sheep farmers in Ireland and that would be a disaster given that the EU is only 86% self sufficient in sheepmeat. I ask the Minister to do more than rejig the premium and I look forward to hearing his views on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising the plight of sheep farmers and the sheep industry. Everybody is disappointed with the downturn in the last couple of weeks. During the first quarter of the year prices for lamb were attractive and everybody hoped that would continue. However, it is a difficult category of farming. It is mainly carried out in disadvantaged areas and in any category of farming where there are no quotas or supply control, there will be over production. There has been considerable over production in this category, particularly in the UK and in Spain, and it regularly leads to these difficulties.</P>
      <P>Under the Agenda 2000 agreement, headage grants in the disadvantaged areas will move from a payment per animal basis to a payment per hectare. Under transitional arrangements the headage schemes as they have operated until now will continue to apply this year. In the change from headage to hectare basis I am committed to introducing a system which will protect the payment levels to the categories of farmers for whom disadvantaged areas payments are an important part of their income. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a task force, representative of the Department and the main farming bodies, was established to formulate a new scheme. The task force has met on a number of occasions and discussions on the nature of a new scheme are currently under way between the Department and the farming bodies. The details of any new scheme will have to be approved by the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>As part of those discussions, the question of how sheep farmers generally should be accommodated within a new scheme has been examined. Until now, sheep farmers in all disadvantaged areas were paid £11 on mountain breeding ewes substantially maintained on mountain grazings while hogget ewes maintained on mountain and lowland grazings attracted a payment of £12 per hogget ewe. The maximum grant payable was £2,000 per producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing scheme, therefore, sheep producers in lowlands were precluded from being paid in respect of breeding ewes. One of the issues being examined in the context of the discussions with the farming organisations is how payment of compensatory allowances might be <Col N="1066" /> extended to sheep producers in lowlands who maintain a flock of breeding ewes. The vast bulk of lowland sheep producers have a mixture of breeding ewes and hogget ewes but since payment is currently confined to hogget ewes, some producers do not qualify for payment at all and those who do qualify do not in all cases attract the maximum payment of £2,000. The further difficulty, highlighted by Deputy Connaughton, is that due to the retention period the hoggets come on the market at this time and create difficulties for everybody.</P>
    <P>The discussions with the farming organisations are continuing and various options are being considered. No final proposals have been made and no final decisions have been arrived at. What has been taking place is the consideration of a range of options in the context of the changes in the system which arise from the Agenda 2000 agreement. We hope to conclude the discussions shortly in order to be in a position to submit proposals to the EU Commission. The final agreement will be a consensus between the farming organisations and the Department. It will ensure that the new system will protect the payment levels of farmers as they were under the headage system. However, any new arrangements cannot proceed without the approval of the EU Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue. The issue of autologous transfusions was brought to my notice by a doctor and a patient. The patient has to go to hospital for surgery and the surgery will probably require a blood transfusion. She was anxious to donate her own blood in advance so that this blood could be used in the transfusion during the operation. To the surprise of this woman and her GP, this facility is available from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service in Dublin but not in Cork or, to my knowledge, in any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to arrange for this important service to be made available both in Cork and in other parts of the country. The number of people who might opt for this service is small but using one's own blood is the safest method of blood transfusion. The blood is a perfect match and there will not be an adverse reaction due to mismatched blood types. If one is disease free, one obviously cannot contract a disease from the blood. In addition, it gives a person great peace of mind to know that his or her own blood is to be used &ndash; this was at the heart of the matter which the lady in question brought to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made inquiries with the BTSB about this, and was told it is possible and it would not take much to make this available to citizens. I want to impress on the Minister the importance of doing this, especially in light of all the fear and disquiet which exists around blood transfusion. I did some <Col N="1067" /> research into it and discovered that this is readily available, especially in America where they can freeze blood for up to ten years if people want to use it in blood transfusions.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in certain cases it has been shown that the use of one's own blood reduces patient recovery time which can obviously lead to less time spent in hospital and a financial saving to the Exchequer and insurance companies like VHI. In addition, it seems that using one's own blood in certain cases, especially in operations on cancer of the neck, head, etc., where transfusions are necessary, reduces the risk the cancer recurring. I came across studies which indicate this, whereby if one gets somebody else's blood in these operations, the risk of getting cancer again is actually increased.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to set in train a study in this area and put in place resources and personnel, if it is merited as I think it is, to enable citizens to avail of this service not only in Dublin, where it is available, but across the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this issue on the Adjournment. Autologous blood transfusion is the facility whereby a patient donates or pre-deposits blood for his or her own use prior to elective surgery. Decisions regarding the utilisation of autologous procedures in individual cases are a matter for the hospital consultant with clinical responsibility for the patient. However, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, formerly the Blood Transfusion Service Board, has a policy of providing an autologous blood transfusion service on request subject to strict guidelines, fully informed consent and on the basis of referral from a hospital consultant.</P>
      <P>In addition to the IBTS, some hospitals provide their own autologous service. For example, in the Southern Health Board region this service is provided by Cork University Hospital and, through CUH, to all other hospitals in the Southern Health Board area. The autologous service in the Southern Health Board must be requested by the surgeon in charge of the case, and the procedure is carried out by appointment with the clinical haematology team at CUH.</P>
      <P>Autologous pre-deposit is appropriate only in a minority of elective procedures and there is lack of unanimous agreement among clinicians about its value. Decisions regarding the utilisation of autologous procedures in individual cases, as I have said, are a matter for the patient's clinician. I would advise any patient who wishes to avail of this service to discuss the matter with his or her consultant, who will provide the appropriate advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to appreciate that not all patients undergoing surgery will be suitable to pre-deposit their blood. Some may not meet the medical criteria, and other factors such as adequate venous access are essential consider<Col N="1068" /> ations. The policy of the IBTS, on the recommendation of its medical consultants, is that in general autologous donors should meet the service's guidelines set down for donors. These guidelines are in line with the recommendations of the Council of Europe Guide to the Preparation, Use and Quality Assurance of Blood Components.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe's guidelines stipulate that autologous blood components obtained from pre-operative donations must be collected, prepared and stored in the same conditions as donations for other persons, or allogenic donations. Blood typing and microbiological screening for autologous transfusion should be the same as the minimum required for allogenic components, and methods of preparation should be the same, except that autologous donations should be maintained in separate batches. All the same pre-tranfusion tests must be carried out as for allogenic donations. For the reasons outlined, the pre-deposit procedures must be performed in, or under the control of, blood transfusion centres or hospital haematology departments.</P>
    <P>In cases of elective surgery where a blood transfusion is expected, the responsible clinician, usually the surgeon or anaesthetist, must prescribe pre-operative donations. The decision to do so will include the type and number of components required.</P>
    <P>The guidelines stipulate that the patient must be informed of the respective risks and constraints of both autologous and allogenic transfusion, and that allogenic transfusion may also have to be used if necessary. The guidelines also state that the patient should be informed that unused units of blood will be destroyed. Having been fully informed of the procedure, the patient should then be in a position to give written informed consent.</P>
    <P>The final responsibility for ensuring that the patient's health is satisfactory to allow donation of the required number of units rests with the doctor who undertakes the pre-deposit procedures. The patient's status with regard to virological markers must also be established before the final decision is made. The Council of Europe's recommendations are that pre-deposit donations may be safely carried out in elderly patients, although more careful consideration is advised in the case of patients over 70.</P>
    <P>I understand that most cases of autologous transfusion tend to be associated with orthopaedic surgery but may also be carried out in respect of other procedures.

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Deputy Gerard Reynolds, who gave notice of his intention to raise a matter, is on his way to the House. Therefore, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to bear with us for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, for my delay. It was not totally my fault.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue due to the number of old age pensioners who contacted me concerning the national car testing scheme. Most OAPs drive older cars and few of them can afford to change their cars for new ones. The Government provides free travel to all old age pensioners, which is very welcome, but in rural Ireland there is no adequate public transport service. Old people in rural areas must rely on their own vehicles to go from one place to another and get to shops and other essential services. With the introduction of the car test, they are now being penalised by extra charges. Old age pensioners believe the scheme is necessary because the safety of their vehicles is of paramount importance but they feel the Government is discriminating against them by charging for car testing.</P>
      <P>When my colleague, Deputy Timmins, recently submitted a parliamentary question regarding the cost of introducing the car test, some interesting figures were given in reply. One of the surprising aspects of the information received by Deputy Timmins was that the cost to date of supervising the national car test service is £155,000. I do not suggest that extra money should be found but that money already in the system should be set against the charges which old age pensioners are asked to pay for their car tests. For example, the monitoring of the service is carried out by the Department with the assistance of the supervision services contractor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Belfast, which was awarded the supervisory contract for a term which extends to 30 June 2000, at a cost of £155,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> I accept that the cost had to be put in place when the scheme was introduced but I do not believe that once the scheme is successfully in operation it will be necessary to have a supervisory scheme in place. It would be more equitable if the Government used the money allocated for the supervision of the service to waive the charge on old age pensioners in rural areas who need transport.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will relay my suggestion to the Minister. It is not necessary that PricewaterhouseCoopers continues to supervise the national car test over the coming years. The test is being carried out adequately and the money could be better spent on waiving testing charges for old age pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for raising this important matter. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this matter and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the compulsory national car test is required under EU Directive 96/96/ EU. Ireland sought and received a derogation under this directive, which provided for a significantly later commencement date for car testing compared with most other member states. The derogation has expired and, as a consequence, it was necessary for Ireland to fulfil its obligations under the directive and commence testing on 4 January 2000.</P>
      <P>The successful introduction of car testing is a key vehicle-related measure in the Government's strategy for road safety. The national car test, or NCT, will ensure that the essential safety elements of cars are in good condition. However, the full safety benefit of the NCT can only be realised in an overall framework of responsible behaviour by road users. This means not only making sure that cars are safe to drive but also driving them safely.</P>
      <P>There has been a high level of public acceptance of the need for compulsory car testing. The results of tests should give owners reassurance that the test is a reasonable one. Some 50% of all cars tested have passed at the first attempt. Test certificates have been granted for 80% of all cars following the test or a first repeat test. This gives the lie to the fears of some motorists at the outset that the test was designed to fail older cars so that they could not be used again on the road. These results will have a beneficial effect on road safety and on air quality at a time when the Environmental Protection Agency is signalling the growing need to tackle air pollution from road transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Car ownership and use has always involved significant private costs and the £35 for a test every two years must be seen in the context of overall costs. In the case of a small to medium sized car, typical maintenance costs are estimated by the <Col N="1071" /> AA to be in the order of £800 to £900 per year. It has always been accepted that responsibility for costs of this kind should rest with the private motorist. Indeed even without the introduction of the national car test there has been a long-standing duty on motorists to maintain cars in a safe condition.</P>
    <P>The test and re-test fees for the national car test arise from the self-financing nature of the service. The company has a legal obligation to provide tests to a high standard and is remunerated by the fees alone. The reduction in fee income because of free tests for some motorists would have to be compensated for from other sources of revenue. An Exchequer subvention funded by taxpayers generally would mean taxpayers who cannot afford a car themselves subsidising others in a more favourable position than themselves. <Col N="1072" /> Furthermore, it is recognised in all other European Union countries and in the wider international community that responsibility for motoring costs is a personal one. It is also highly likely that any Exchequer assistance relating to the costs of complying with the vehicle testing directive which is binding in all member states would be subject to a legal challenge by the European Commission. For these reasons there are no proposals to make changes to the fees for the national car test at this time. However, proposals being developed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, on the development of a rural transport scheme will address many of the mobility problems of elderly rural dwellers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 59 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The most recently published inflation figures for Ireland which relate to April show a year on year increase of 4.9% in the consumer price index, CPI, and a 5% increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. The EU HICP for the same period was 1.7%; for the euro 11 it was 1.9%. The increase in inflation in Ireland has been due to a number of factors, which include the sharp increase in oil prices, the fall in the value of the euro, the budget increase in excise duty on tobacco and an increase in underlying domestic inflation.</P>
      <P>The impact of higher energy prices in particular has been significant. Crude oil prices increased from a low of $11 per barrel in March 1999 to a peak in March this year of over $30 per barrel. In Irish punt terms the increase was larger due to the fall in the value of the euro. The energy products index is up 15.3% in the year to April 2000 and it is estimated that this has added close to 1.5% to the CPI. The increase in excise duties for health reasons on tobacco has also added about 1% to the CPI and this will pass out of the index by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Thus, a large part of the recent increase in inflation reflects exceptional factors. These factors will become less significant over time and, as a consequence, it is expected that inflation will fall in the second half of this year. The extent of these falls will depend on the value of the euro and future oil price developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding this uncertainty, it is now clear that inflation will be higher than the 3% average for the year which was forecast on budget <Col N="1074" /> day. A revised forecast will be published as usual by my Department in the economic review and outlook in July-August. It is now expected that inflation will average in the order of 4% for the year as a whole, though the rate will be less than this at end December.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this is higher than expected when the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness were being negotiated. However, this agreement is for three years and I am confident that over the remaining period of the agreement inflation will fall well below current levels. In this context, the appropriate policy response is to fully implement the terms of the PPF. The agreed pay increases combined with promised tax reductions will provide for continued gains in real disposable incomes.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view, therefore, that the pay terms of the agreement must be adhered to. An unsustainable wage-price spiral would do severe damage to competitiveness and future economic prospects and undermine the progress we have made in recent years. Adherence to the agreement will ensure that the recent rise in inflation is temporary.</P>

      <P>Flood relief scheme proposals for the following areas have also been identified for attention: the Kilchreest area involving the taking of water from the Owenshree river below Kilchreest to the Aggard stream and on to the Dunkellin river catchment; the Termon area which involves the transfer of flood waters away from the south Galway area to the adjoining Fergus river catchment area in County Clare and the Kiltiernan-Ballinderreen areas, which would necessitate the original scheme for the area, which was carried out by private individuals, being revisited and investigated and designed in a comprehensive manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance of payments data recently released by the CSO show that the merchandise trade surplus for 1999 was £17,777 million, an increase of £3,637 million over 1998. The deficit on services in 1999 was £8,903 million, an increase of £1,819 million over 1998. The combined surplus on merchandise and services in 1999 was £8,874 million compared to £7,056 million in 1998. The trade surplus in 1999, therefore, was higher than in 1998 and shows that the economy is continuing to perform very strongly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may, of course, be referring to the question of the overall surplus on the current account which declined from £1,173 million in 1998 to £233 million in 1999. The reduction in the surplus is due to a number of factors such as an increase in profit repatriations and lower current transfers which arose mainly in the IFSC. Current transfers mainly relate to non-life insurance business.</P>
      <P>I have no concerns about the current account which is still in surplus. Indeed, the decline in the surplus is in line with what had been expected. While the surplus was lower in 1999 than in 1998, this is not surprising given the substantial level of investment in the economy at present. This investment strengthens the possibility of growth in future years.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are 36 Dublin based officers currently deployed on DIRT audits under section 904A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. In addition to this group, 30 audit officers based outside Dublin have been trained in DIRT audit procedures and techniques and these have been deployed for varying periods in the DIRT audit programme. The total number of outdoor staff engaged on all audits, investigations and inquiries of various kinds, including the DIRT audits, is about 380. This number includes higher tax officers who are engaged in tax audits.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the main work on the DIRT audit project will be completed by the end of next month at which stage the officers involved will begin to be released back to their normal audit duties.</P>
      <P>Revenue advises me that a priority is being given at present to the DIRT audit programme and other investigations including those into Ansbacher and various tribunal related matters. All the indications are that these inquiries have potential for significant revenue yield in excess of normal audit yield. Naturally, this prioritisation necessitates some temporary reduction in other forms of audit-investigation activity. A flexible approach in allocating resources to different elements of the audit and investigation programme from year to year is a normal part of the management of that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have made a business case to my Department for additional resources for both audit-investigation and customer service areas.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 51, 65 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, at its meeting on 11 April 2000, approved my proposals to engage in consultations with the financial services industry on the dormant accounts issue and, in this regard, the following bodies have been consulted: Irish Bankers' Federation, Irish Insurance Federation, Irish Mortgage and Savings Association, Irish Association of Investment Managers, Financial Services Industry Association, An Post, NTMA and the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>In the light of these consultations, my officials, within the past few days, presented a report of their findings to me. A number of issues remain to be clarified and I envisage that some further consultations will take place shortly with a view to achieving broad agreement on a scheme. Incidentally, I commend the representatives of the financial services sector for the positive and constructive stance they have taken in these consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This consultation process will be completed shortly and I then intend to circulate revised proposals to my Cabinet colleagues and the Attorney General for their final views, before submitting formal proposals, including heads of a Bill, to Government. I expect to be able to submit these formal proposals within a month or so. I would then expect to receive Government clearance to <Col N="1078" /> have the heads referred to the Parliamentary Draftsman's office for the formal drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legal complexities associated with the initiative, these are issues which will have to be addressed at the drafting stage and I could not go into any detail at this stage. Clearly, the major issue to be addressed in this area would be the protection of property rights in the Constitution, the right to privacy of the individual and the duty of confidentiality of the bank to its customer, etc.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to publish the dormant accounts Bill later this year. As regards the extent of moneys in dormant accounts, this would depend on what dormancy period is decided upon and the scope of accounts and other financial products which are brought within the definition. During the consultation process with the financial services sector, some updating of the estimates of dormant funds were supplied. For illustrative purposes, I will outline the position in regard to funds dormant at the 20 year benchmark. They are as follows:</P>

    <P>I should, however, issue a caution regarding the above figures. It is reasonable to assume that as soon as the scheme is announced and-or the banks, etc., begin to notify customers that their accounts are being considered for possible dormancy status, the legitimate owners are then likely to reactivate the accounts. This, in fact, is a desirable outcome since the underlying aim of the initiative is, after all, to reunite dormant funds with their legitimate owners.</P>

      <P>Legislation is currently being prepared by my Department which will provide for the establishment, financing, investment and management of a national pensions fund. It is envisaged that the fund will help finance the Exchequer cost of social welfare and public service pensions over the long term. The legislation will provide a statutory obligation to pay a sum equivalent to 1% of GNP from the Exchequer into the fund each year and will enable further additional sums to be allocated to the fund from time to time following Dáil approval. It will also provide for the transfer into the fund of money currently held in the temporary holding fund for superannuation liabilities, which amount to over £4 billion. The legislation will contain provisions regarding investment policy, future drawdown of the fund, management structures and accounting and reporting requirements.</P>
      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency will have a significant role in the management of the fund and my Department has had detailed discussions with the agency on all aspects of the legislation. Considerable progress has been made and I expect to be in a position to introduce a Bill in the House before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>In my address to the Institute of Taxation, I outlined the main elements of the substantial programme for tax reductions and reform announced in Budget 2000, which are the personal taxation measures, the amendment and extension of pension fund provisions and the changes in capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>On the establishment of a single standard rate band for each individual taxpayer, I explained that this was part of the Government's strategy to reduce the number of taxpayers on the higher rate of tax to 20% as promised in the Government's Action Plan for the Millennium. I stated that this objective could only be realised by widening the standard rate band and that the best way of achieving this was by restructuring the standard rate band so that persons are taxed on what they earn as individuals, whether single or married. The measures in Budget 2000 will ensure that the number of taxpayers on the top rate will fall by 125,000 in the 2000-1 tax year, from what it otherwise would have been. The new system will also rectify the imbalance in the tax system against most taxpayers who are single or two earner families.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that section 1.1.4 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states that:</P>
      <P>The Social Partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. They also agree that the standard rate income tax band should be kept under review in the light of increases in income levels and the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to proceed with the policy of establishing a single standard rate band, to secure these objectives which I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are at present well advanced in a programme of DIRT look-back audits, going right back to 1986, in the case of financial institutions who are relevant deposit takers under the DIRT legislation. These audits are being carried out using the new powers given to Revenue in the Finance Act, 1999. In all, 40 or so financial institutions are being covered in the audit programme. At this stage, 30 audits are ongoing, including those in the main institutions. These audits are well advanced and arrangements have been made for the remaining audits to be carried out in the next month.</P>
      <P>The focus of Revenue's DIRT look-back audits is on checking a sample of non-resident accounts, as provided for in the legislation, in each of the financial institutions concerned. The information gathered from checking the sample of non-resident accounts, together with the other information obtained by inspectors in the course of their audits, will allow Revenue form a view on compliance with the DIRT legislation and, where necessary, an estimation of the level, if any, of DIRT under-deducted by the financial institution.</P>
      <P>Although the Revenue audit programme is well advanced, work remains to be done and the audits have not yet reached the stage where it is possible to make an interim report of amounts of DIRT, interest and penalties arising. When Revenue have completed the audit in each financial institution, it will present the results to the management and seek to reach agreement on the amount of underpaid DIRT liabilities together with interest and penalties. If agreement is reached, the case can be settled on that basis. On the other hand, if agreement is not forthcoming assessments will be raised by Revenue which can, of course, be appealed to the appeal commissioners and the courts.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in section 68 of the Finance Act, 2000, for the Revenue Commissioners to publish the results, including interim results, of their look-back DIRT audits, covering the years 1986-7 to 1998-9, inclusive. Revenue are required to make a report to the Committee of Public Accounts before 1 November 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 53 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>After the withdrawal of ICC from the sale process and the failure of the merger and flotation of ACC and TSB, I made it clear to all concerned that the <i>status quo</i> could not continue and that it was more important than ever that each organisation address the need for change in order to face the increasingly competitive marketplace. I am still of the view that a change in the ownership structure is vitally important to secure the long-term interests of each bank and I asked each of them in January to review their position with a view to bringing forward proposals for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On ACC, I received a copy of its strategic plan for the future development of the bank, which the board has endorsed. I have informed the board <Col N="1083" /> of ACC Bank through the chairman that it will have my full support in preparing to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive marketplace. ICC intends to submit its proposals regarding its future to me in June and I will consider them upon receipt.</P>
    <P>Taking any strategy forward will, of course, require in all of the banks the close co-operation of management and staff, and I am sure that this will be forthcoming through the partnership process.</P>
    <P>The trustees of TSB Bank, with my full support, announced on the 28 March that they were inviting proposals on the future of the bank. When this process is completed, I would expect to receive a formal request from the trustees to approve new arrangements. An order under section 57 of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, which would have to be approved by each House of the Oireachtas, would be required to authorise any reorganisation of the TSB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 62, 79 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Finance I have not commented in the past on either the Irish punt exchange rate or the euro exchange rate and I do not now propose to make any specific comment on the euro exchange rate.</P>
      <P>The euro 11 Finance Ministers and the ECB share the view that growth is now very robust in the euro area and is increasingly rooted in domestic demand. They consider that, as a consequence, the euro has potential for appreciation, firmly based on growth and internal price stability. In their view, a strong economy goes along with a strong currency.</P>
      <P>A statement issued following the euro 11 Finance Ministers' meeting on 8 May again pointed out that the euro 11 Ministers and Commissioner Pedro Solbes and the president of the ECB share the view that growth is very robust in the euro area; an increasing number of jobs are being created.</P>
      <P>The statement went on to say that the ECB is committed to ensure that this growth will remain non-inflationary. Ministers are determined to speed up ongoing fiscal consolidation and structural reform towards a knowledge based full employment economy according to the orientations set by the special European Council in Lisbon, thus increasing the growth potential of our economies.</P>
      <P>The statement continued that we share a common concern about the present level of the euro, which does not reflect the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in the value of the euro would be expected to have an impact on the Irish economy. On the positive side, the competitiveness of Irish companies exporting to non-euro zone countries should improve, leading to higher exports and employment. On the negative side, the price of goods from outside the euro zone would rise. This <Col N="1086" /> increase in import prices would, in turn, be expected to put upward pressure on inflation.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it has been agreed that the Government and the social partners will monitor inflationary pressures in the economy on an ongoing basis, in the light of implementation of all of the terms of the PPF and the objective of securing the low inflationary conditions envisaged in the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civil Service is the area for which I have direct responsibility. The position there is that, prior to 31 July 1973, the law required that female employees had to resign on marriage. In such cases, employees under pension age who had at least five years' service qualified for marriage gratuities of 1/12th of salary per year of service, subject to a maximum of one year's salary.</P>
      <P>Where a person who resigns before pension age subsequently becomes a civil servant, the break in service does not debar the reckoning of the prior service for purposes of any pension benefits for which they subsequently become eligible in respect of the later service. In order to aggregate the periods of service, an appropriate refund must be made in respect of any payment made to them on the occasion of the initial resignation. This would be of benefit to any of the employees affected by the marriage bar who re-entered the Civil Service after 1973.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the Superannuation Acts to provide pensions for officers who resigned on marriage before 1973. Such change would, <i>inter alia</i>, have wide ramifications for employees who left the public service before the introduction of preserved pension entitlements.</P>

      <P>The report Gender Equality in the Civil Service is the outcome of research commissioned as part of the ongoing development of human resources management policies under the Strategic Management Initiative in the Civil Service. Delivering Better Government noted that while the Civil Service had been to the forefront in developing and implementing policies to achieve greater equality of opportunity, women employees remained concentrated at lower levels. In view of the need to redress the imbalance, DBG recommended that appropriate strategies be put in place. It was in this context that research was commissioned on the under representation of women in the grades at and above HEO level.</P>
      <P>The main research findings, together with a package of measures based on the recommendations in the report, were endorsed by the Government and were presented by the Taoiseach and me at the launch of the current phase of the Strategic Management Initiative for the Civil Service in July 1999.</P>
      <P>The key elements of these measures are: the development and adoption of a new equality policy; a programme of affirmative action in the main human resource policy areas of recruitment, placement and mobility, training and development, promotion, work and family responsibilities, language and sexual harassment and policy delivery; the adoption of strategic objective setting at individual Department-office level, including the setting of increasingly specific equality goals, to be achieved over a stated period of time; new equality structures to be put in place, both locally and centrally, to support implementation of the policy and the adoption of a communications strategy for implementation.</P>
      <P>A high level gender equality management group, chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily, Revenue Commissioner, is at an advanced stage of developing a new gender equality policy for the Civil Service. It is an objective of the measures agreed by Government that significant progress should be made towards improving the representation of women at senior management levels in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently agreed a new policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying for the Civil Service with the staff unions. The purpose of the policy is to provide a positive working environment and an effective mechanism for the investigation of complaints of harassment, sexual harassment and bullying.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the provision of EU funding to assist with the rebuilding of Kosovo and the western Balkans; if he related these views in full to the EU Budget Commissioner, Michaele Schreyer during a meeting which took place ahead of the last ECOFIN meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14277/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lisbon European Council in March 2000 reaffirmed that the peace, prosperity and stability of south-east Europe is a strategic priority for the European Union. Ireland, like all member states, is committed to reconstruction in Kosovo and the western Balkans as one of the means by which this can be achieved. In this context, the EU budget for 2000 makes substantial provision for urgent assistance to the region in terms of food and humanitarian aid, with a total commitment of 360 million euro for Kosovo in 2000.</P>
      <P>For the longer term, funding levels need to reflect reliable assessments of immediate needs, well thought out strategies for the future sustainable development of the region, and a realistic assistance programme. In that context, the Commission was asked to present a detailed assessment of needs for the region to the Council of Ministers, but has so far failed to do so.</P>
      <P>The Commission has, however, proposed a revision of the Berlin Financial Perspectives in order to fund a figure of 5.5 billion euro which it believes is needed for Kosovo and the western Balkans. The financial perspectives set out for each year the expenditure ceilings for the different categories of EU budget expenditure. The Commission proposal involves increasing the sub-ceiling for EU budget spending on external actions at the expense of EU spending on agriculture.</P>
      <P>In my meeting with Commissioner Schreyer on 19 April 2000, I stated my opposition to any revision of the financial perspectives agreed at the Berlin Council. The perspectives represent a finely balanced and hard won political agreement. That agreement is reflected in the financial envelopes for different categories of expenditure, which cannot be set aside without reopening European Council decisions. Re-opening those decisions now could lead only to increased demands for the future.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the commissioner that I looked forward to considering the Commission's detailed assessment of needs for the western Balkans when it was presented to Council. I noted that the Commission accepted that the financial perspectives agreed at Berlin could already accommodate funding of some 3.2 billion euro assistance for the region to 2006. Finally I underlined my willingness to consider options within the 2001 budget procedure which would provide necessary funding for the region without altering the financial perspectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the 8 May ECOFIN held an orientation debate on the 2001 budget, including the issue of support for the western Balkans. The official conclusions of the Council meeting stated in this regard that &ldquo;the member states considered that a revision of the <Col N="1089" /> financial perspective could not be envisaged at the present stage and that in any case there should first of all be a thorough evaluation of requirements&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, save-as you-earn schemes were introduced in the Finance Act, 1999. There are two elements to an SAYE scheme, an approved savings-related share option scheme and a certified contractual savings scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the share option scheme a company can grant an employee an option to purchase shares in the company at a pre-determined price, which cannot be less than 75% of the market value of the shares. The contractual savings scheme allows the employee to save towards the cost of those shares and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have, to date, certified five separate financial institutions to hold relevant deposits under these schemes.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also advised me that to date, 30 companies have received formal approval to operate an SAYE scheme. In addition 29 companies have submitted preliminary documents to the Revenue Commissioners for consideration and these are being examined.</P>
      <P>In the region of 33,000 people are employed by the companies which have received approval but it is not possible, at this early stage, to assess these schemes. The schemes will be reviewed each year by way of issue of a return of information to each company. The operation of the SAYE scheme can be monitored in the light of this information.</P>
      <P>As regards initiatives to encourage SAYE schemes, I understand that an information booklet has been produced by the Revenue Commissioners and it is available on the Revenue Commissioners web site &ndash; www.revenue.ie. In addition, staff from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have been involved in seminars on SAYE schemes organised by IBEC and the National Centre for Partnership, and I also spoke at both of these.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 85 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, the Government agreed, in principle, to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services area. The McDowell implementation advisory group was then set up to progress the necessary work. The group finalised its report on 19 May 1999 and submitted it to me and the Tánaiste on the following day. The report was published on 23 June 1999, in order to facilitate public consideration of the issues that are involved.</P>
      <P>The report contains a considerable number of recommendations, and these are being considered in both my Department and the Tánaiste's Department. Certain aspects of the modalities of establishing a single regulatory authority are being reviewed, and when these have been settled, the Tánaiste and I will bring the proposals to Government for consideration and decision.</P>
      <P>As regards credit unions, I should point out that the McDowell group considered that all financial service providers should, in principle, be dealt with by the SRA, and that a compelling case would have to be made for the exclusion of any provider from its remit.</P>
      <P>In considering the position of credit unions, the group recommended that the approach which would best address these considerations would be to have the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies regarding credit unions brought into the SRA. The group recommended the establishment of a statutory position of registrar of credit unions within the SRA.</P>

      <P>I am currently preparing legislation which will confer a number of additional functions on the NTMA. The Bill is being drafted in the Office of the Attorney General and will provide for the establishment of a State claims agency which will enable the NTMA to manage accidental personal injury and property damage compensation claims <Col N="1091" /> against the State and to provide risk management services; a central treasury service which will enable the NTMA to offer deposit and loan facilities to health boards, vocational educational committees, local authorities and other designated public sector bodies; and a fund management service which will enable the NTMA to provide fund management services in respect of funds under the control of Government Ministers whenever such services are required by the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Bill will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>I will also be introducing legislation shortly to provide for the establishment of the national pension reserve fund in order to prefund part of the future costs to the Exchequer of social welfare and public service pensions. This legislation will give the NTMA a central role in the management of the fund.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these legislative changes will allow the NTMA to build on the strengths it already possesses as a debt management agency and to use its expertise to provide further specialised services to the State which will result in savings for the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>A major review of local government financing was carried out in recent years. In the course of that review a range of options for funding local authorities was considered. This culminated in the establishment of the local government fund in 1999 which put local government finance on a new footing and resulted in a significant increase in local government resources. The receipts of motor taxation are paid into this fund. In 1999 those receipts totalled some £357 million. In addition to motor tax receipts, the Exchequer also makes a contribution to the fund, totalling £270 million in 1999 and £285 million in 2000. Local authorities also have other direct sources of revenue, in particular commercial rates which provided an estimated £412 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer also provides significant direct funding to local authorities and the regional authorities for specific programmes such as housing, roads, water and waste water services. The National Development Plan 2000-06 provides for very substantial investment programmes in these areas.</P>
      <P>In the light of this, I see no reason for any further change in the method of funding local authorities at this time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is seeking an update to the information which I gave on 30 March in reply to a question put down by Deputy O'Sullivan. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the position at 19 May is as follows.</P>
      <P>The examination of the 24,095 companies which failed to reply to the notices issued by Revenue is ongoing. This list of cases has been compared with the Companies Registration Office list of companies which have been struck off. Also, some further replies have been received from the companies. The number of companies which have failed to reply now stands at 19,537. A scan of the full list involving the checking of the up-to-date Companies Registration Office record for possible changes of addresses of registered offices has been carried out. New addresses have been identified for 2,808 of the companies and Revenue will shortly be issuing a duplicate notice to each of these companies. The balance 16,729 &ndash; 19,537 less 2,808 &ndash; is included in the list of companies for strike off action.</P>
      <P>The 9,389 companies in respect of which the letter was returned to the Revenue Commissioners indicating that the addressee is unknown have been checked against the Companies Registration Office list of companies which have been struck off. After excluding companies which have already been struck off by the Companies Registration Office and adding the small number of letters that continue to be returned indicating that the addressee is unknown the number in this category now stands at 7,994. By examining the Companies Registration Office record Revenue have established changed addresses for 2,470 companies. A duplicate notice will shortly be issued to each of these companies. The balance of 5,524 has now been added to the list of companies for strike off action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total list for strike off now stands at 22,253 &ndash; that is, the 16,729 which failed to reply plus the 5,524 returned marked &ldquo;addressee unknown&rdquo;. Some final checks are currently being carried out on this list and final arrangements are being made with the Companies Registration <Col N="1093" /> Office for the forwarding of the list and the commencement of strike-off procedures.</P>
    <P>I indicated in my reply to Deputy Owen on 10 November that, as well as writing to 38,996 companies incorporated prior to 11 February 1999, Revenue also wrote to 8,397 companies incorporated after that date. In respect of this latter group a list of approximately 3,000 has been sent to the Companies Registration Office for strike-off consideration by the registrar under the Companies (Amendment) (No 2) Act, 1999. Revenue have written to each of the companies on the list advising them of the position. It is expected that the registrar will commence strike off proceedings for these companies very shortly.</P>

My understanding is that the discussions with the industry representatives were conducted in a positive atmosphere, and served as an opportunity to clear any possible tensions between the groups. All sides set out their respective requirements and clarified their misgivings. In broad terms, there now exists a greater understanding of the issues to be addressed, and an increased appreciation of the concerns expressed by each representative body.</P>
    <P>It is to be expected that each body within the industry would adopt a strategy which would allow it to represent its key interests and concerns at the negotiating table but this does not constitute a split.</P>

The programme complement is the document for implementing the programme which will contain details such as the measures to be implemented and the financing plan, selection criteria, implementing agency, final beneficiary and monitoring indicators for each measure. It will chair and provide the secretariat for the monitoring committee of the regional operational programme &ndash; as managing authority, the assembly will have the discretion to propose to the monitoring committee changes in the EU co-funded element of the regional operational programme.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the establishment of a public service benchmarking body to undertake a fundamental examination of the pay of public service employees <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector. Under the programme this body has to be established within three months of the commencement of the agreement, that is by 31 December 2000 and produce its report and recommendations by the end of 2002, to allow the parties to discuss the implementation of its recommendations in the context of any successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. However, in view of the complexity of the task and the need to allow time for its findings to be discussed, my Department is working with the public service unions to seek to establish it early, before the autumn, and to ask it to report by autumn 2002.</P>
      <P>The benchmarking exercise will cover pay and jobs in the public service and across the economy. It will examine and compare job content, duties and responsibilities in both sectors. The examination will also be based on indepth and comprehensive research, examination and analysis of private sector pay, across a range of employment-types and sectors, and will take account of the way reward systems are structured in the private sector. Any increases which might emerge from the exercise will not take effect during the period of this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement makes it clear that cross-sectoral relativities are incompatible with the operation of benchmarking and, even within a given sector, traditional or historical relativities between groups will not prevent the benchmarking body from recommending what it considers are appropriate pay rates on the basis of existing circumstances. There will be only one report covering all the groups involved in order <Col N="1096" /> to achieve a coherent and integrated approach, and to avoid the problems of the past where an award based on the alleged exceptional circumstances of a particular group quickly led to a spiral of special pay increases right across the public service.</P>
    <P>There is a perception among some public servants that their pay has fallen behind private sector pay &ndash; while private sector employees believe that public service pay has increased at a faster rate than theirs. Public service pay cannot evolve in isolation. It has to be set in the context of pay in the wider economy, to ensure equity between public service and private sector employees. The proposal to establish a benchmarking body represents a major initiative which is designed to provide a logical and coherent approach going forward on public service pay.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Latest available CSO statistics on manufacturing unit labour costs are for Q1 of 1999. These indicate that manufacturing unit labour costs decreased by 3.0% year on year. This follows a trend of decline which has been evident for more than a decade in Irish manufacturing and has arisen because the rate of growth in manufacturing wages has been exceeded by the rate of growth in productivity or output per manhour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> As to the outlook for 2000, it is unclear what assessment the Deputy may be referring to. However, the Central Bank in its spring 2000 quarterly bulletin is forecasting a slight improvement in unit wage costs in manufacturing relative to main trading partners in a common currency in the year 2000. As their projected rate of change in Irish wages is forecast to be in excess of that of main trading partners, they are implying that the rate of productivity increases in manufacturing in Irish will more than offset the relative growth in wages. We see no reason to disagree with the bank's view.</P>
    <P>Some increase in wages in 2000 is inevitable given the tightness of the Irish labour market. The ESRI has pointed out that the indications are that these pressures will remain through to at least the end of 2001. The tight labour market is driving increases across the economy. If wage expectations became excessive as growth slows there will be adverse implications for competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Added to concerns about wages growth, there are two other issues to consider. The first is the dualistic nature of Irish manufacturing where the performance of indigenous firms continues to be lower than that of leading typically high-tech sectors. A high rate of wages growth unless offset by superior productivity performance may eventually undermine the competitiveness of Irish industry. Productivity gains for the manufacturing sector as a whole arise predominantly in the leading high tech sectors. By comparison, productivity gains in indigenous industry have been relatively low. Clearly therefore any acceleration of wage growth could affect indigenous industry to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>The second area of concern is the behaviour of sterling. While sterling is currently very strong against the euro and has hence assisted firms trading in the UK, any significant reversal of this would affect the competitiveness of Irish goods and services on the UK market.</P>

      <P>In relation to tax reductions, the review of the Government's An Action Plan for the Millennium in November 1999, states:</P>
      <P>Tax reductions are an integral part of our strategy to maintain and improve competitiveness and to encourage the take up of employment. Our aim will be to complete implementation of the specific and ambitious aims set out in our Action Programme for the Millennium, through a balanced strategy of removing more of the low-paid from the tax net altogether, by reducing tax rates, by ensuring that a large majority of taxpayers are subject to no more than the standard rate and by completing the transition to a more progressive system of tax credits.</P>
      <P>The agreed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness further states:</P>
      <P>Over the period of this Programme, up to and including Budget 2003, there will be increases in net take home pay, including pay increases, of up to 25% or more. The Government and Social Partners confirm their support for further tax reform and tax reductions to improve the position of all taxpayers, increase the real take-home pay of those covered by this Programme, especially those with below average earnings and to develop the structure of the tax system to deliver benefits and focus resources in an equitable manner.. It is also an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners that, over time, all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net.</P>
      <P>Taken together, the Government action plan and the PPF provide the framework within which future personal tax packages will be drawn up. As regards the inflationary impact of any tax changes, my priority has been to cut direct tax rates to encourage the supply of labour, capital and enterprise and in this way expand the productive base of the economy and our ability to meet the demand side pressure on resources on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The informal was preceded by a meeting of the Euro-11 on 7 April and a meeting of the extended Euro-11 group on 8 April. Discussion at the extended Euro-11 group focused on the tax package and the follow-up to the Lisbon summit.</P>
      <P>At the informal ECOFIN meeting itself, Ministers held a discussion on financial services issues on the basis of a report presented by the EFC, which was generally welcomed by Ministers. Ministers also discussed the broad economic policy guidelines, the Commission's spring economic forecasts, which were due to be published in the middle of April, and the quality of public finances. In addition, there was an exchange of views between Ministers on the economic situation in the EU.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the current tight labour market, with an increased number and variety of opportunities available for those seeking employment, has impacted on the number of applicants for positions in the Civil Service. Like other competitors in the market the Civil Service Commission is having to change to adapt to this new era of choice to ensure it continues to attract top calibre recruits to a career path in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>I, as Minister, recognise that in this era of increased choice, there is a need to ensure that jobs within the Civil Service remain competitively attractive and that there is sufficient awareness of this fact amongst those considering their employment prospects. I also recognise that in this era of choice it is equally important to retain the good, qualified people who have already begun a career in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>In this regard, a number of initiatives have already been undertaken. It is worth mentioning that two marketing studies were commissioned, the first to research the public awareness and perceptions of employment-career opportunities in the Civil Service. The second tackled the issue of staff retention. Following from these studies, a high level team was established, the integrated marketing strategy work group, the objectives of which include the creation of an integrated marketing strategy for the Civil Service, the development of an effective retention policy in the light of current labour market situation and the development of a communications strategy. These initiatives acknowledge that we need to engage in a process of selling the Civil Service as a career which offers significant opportunities for interesting and satisfying work.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Civil Service Commission has significantly increased its activities in the labour market in recent times. It now uses state-of-the-art CD ROM technology, improved press advertisement techniques, radio advertisements and various promotional materials for schools and colleges. It is ever present at major recruitment fairs and exhibitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> The commission has been central in organising a public service open day, which is to be held in the RDS on Sunday 28 May. The Deputy has probably heard or read the advertisements about this. The open day will enhance the profile of both the Civil Service &ndash; with many of its Departments taking stands to show the diversity of career opportunities on offer &ndash; and indeed, of the wider public service.</P>
    <P>Leaving the promotional aspects aside, analysis of the labour market has meant that the Civil Service Commission has had to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the recruitment process, especially for the key open grades of clerical officer and executive officer. Consequently, the Civil Service Commission has been running more targeted and more frequent competitions for a better penetration of the market. For example, in 1999 the Civil Service Commission, as part of the clerical officer recruitment drive, held five separate competitions, attracting some 10,000 applications in total. This grade has been suffering the largest recruitment and retention problems within the Civil Service. These clerical competitions are specifically targeted at various segments or sections of the labour market. The Civil Service Commission has, for instance, targeted persons with disabilities and former civil servants and organised competitions on the basis of the geographical area of the vacancies. This year has seen a continuation of this more focused recruitment approach.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, provides for the elimination of age related remuneration which exists on certain Civil Service scales before October 2002. However, I have taken the opportunity to eliminate lower points on the clerical officer and executive officer scales from a current date. This goes further than is required by the legislation but it will have the effect of increasing the starting salary of these two key recruitment grades to the Civil Service. The higher starting salaries will feature in advertisements for the upcoming competitions for the two grades in question. I believe these changes will have a positive impact in attracting new recruits to those very important grades. They will also improve the position of recent recruits on the lower scale points.</P>

      <Col N="1103" /> However, for the information of the Deputy I set out below some statistics on credit growth in Ireland along with figures on economic growth in Ireland and the euro-zone. The growth in credit reflects Ireland's economic growth which has been a multiple of the euro-zone average for some time. This economic growth has in turn been brought about by the stable economic framework we have in place today.</P>

      <P>The implementation of the new system is among the key objectives of the Civil Service modernisation programme set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. While there is no direct link to individual performance related pay, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness establishes a clear link between the payment of the final phase increase of 4% and the achievement of specific sectoral performance targets under the public service modernisation programme. It makes it clear that performance indicators have to be established in each sector by 1 April 2001 and the targets have to be achieved by 1 April 2002, with progress in this regard being assessed at organisational level by 1 October 2002. The implementation of the performance management and development system in the Civil Service is one such performance indicator.</P>

      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, came into operation on 1 April and it was estimated to benefit 163,000 employees. An ESRI study on the likely impact of the national minimum wage on employment, competitiveness and inflation did conclude that the effect of the minimum wage in raising wages, would lead to some increase in consumer prices in the services sector. The National Minimum Wage Act did have a significant impact on the earnings of apprentice hairdressers and, accordingly, some hairdressing salons may have chosen to increase their prices to take account of increased costs. It is a matter for each individual company to decide what prices it charges its customers. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific price increase referred to by the Deputy, as the price increase is a commercial decision for the company concerned.</P>
      <P>Since 1986 it has been the policy of successive Governments to promote greater competition and customer choice through, among other things, the mechanism of greater price transparency rather than through statutory price control.</P>

      <P>An apprentice's training allowance is based on the net pay the apprentice would normally receive from the employer if being paid the agreed industry norms. The industry norms are the wage agreements that are reached in the different industry sectors, which are notified to FÁS by the employer bodies and the trade unions. These norms vary from sector to sector.</P>
      <P>The training allowance paid to an apprentice is determined by the sector in which the apprentice is employed, and not according to the trade. The apprentice referred to by the Deputy is employed in the engineering sector and would, therefore, be subject to a different wage agreement and consequently a different off-the-job wage-training allowance to that pertaining to an apprentice electrician employed in the construction sector.</P>

      <P>Under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, an employee is defined as a person who works under a contract of employment. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, when debating the legislation in the Oireachtas, pointed out that the legislation conferred on an employee an entitlement to a minimum hourly rate of pay and an obligation on the employer of the employee to pay at least the minimum hourly rate of pay.</P>

    <P>I can confirm that a large number of the applications were received by my Department from the applicants concerned a few weeks ago for work permits to employ non-EEA nationals here. These are now being processed. While it is the Department's goal to deal with applications for <Col N="1108" /> work permits within four weeks, the significant increase in the number of applications this year means that that this can now take up to six weeks. Applications are generally processed in order of receipt, but due regard must and will be given to the particular problems faced at present by the hospitality sector because of its seasonal nature.</P>

This committee will also address the issue of identifying appropriate supports for persons unlikely to succeed in getting, or keeping, a job in the open labour market. The work of this committee will help shape the future policy direction for employment programmes such as community employment and the jobs initiative programme.</P>
      <P>It is also worthwhile noting that the new social economy programme which will be operational this year and will provide for an average of 670 places in 2000 will have a specific emphasis on the provision services to disadvantaged communities.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme is a labour market intervention measure targeted at the long-term unemployed. Eligibility for CE is confined to persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows-widowers pension for a minimum period of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain approval from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme. A person signing for credits is not eligible to participate in CE.</P>
      <P>The present eligibility criteria for the programme were drawn up after a full review of CE was undertaken and in consultation with the social partners. It is designed to better target the programme at the most disadvantaged of society.</P>

      <P>On the issue of safety on leisure craft, as the Deputy is aware, the action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, recently presented me with its final report. On the basis of this I am currently proposing the introduction of a legislative framework for the regulation of all recreational craft. This is being achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which are included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999. The Bill passed the Dáil select committee stage at its session on 16 May 2000. The Bill foresee the implementation of regulations to take account not only the safety of the passengers and occupants of the vessels in question but also the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the vessels and any disturbance or nuisance caused by their usage.</P>
      <P>Following on the enactment of this legislation, I hope to quickly introduce implementing regulations based on the recommendations of the action group's final report. I consider that these regulations, allied to the recently launched Year 2000 Safety on the Water campaign, will contribute to an increase in safety in the water based leisure sector and a resultant decrease in the emergency calls received by the emergency services in future.</P>

      <P>The imposition of tree preservation orders, TPOs, is governed by the provisions of section 45 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. These powers relate to local authorities and do not extend to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>Where a notice of intention to fell trees in accordance with the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1946, is received by my Department, the relevant local authority is immediately contacted to ascertain if it wished to consider the trees of sufficient amenity value or special interest to issue a TPO. Likewise, all felling proposals within proposed natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation or areas covered by the European Union Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) or the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) are referred to Dúchas, at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for their observations and recommendations. The views of all identified relevant competent authorities are taken into account prior to a decision to authorise tree felling.</P>
      <P>These procedures relate to all felling notices lodged and the Deputy can be assured that any applications received for the townland described will undergo a similar process. I have to date received no such application in respect of land in Bunduff. However, a complaint of alleged illegal felling in the Cliffoney area has been received by officials of my Department and the matter is currently under active investigation.</P>

      <P>The Government has now formally approved the establishment of a national maritime college. The new college will be a state of the art centre of excellence for maritime training, capable of meeting Ireland's seafarer training needs into the future. In establishing the college the Government is ensuring that third level education in the maritime disciplines in Ireland will be second to none and will be available to those of our young people who wish to pursue maritime careers.</P>
      <P>The college is to be built on a ten acre site at Ringaskiddy provided by the Department of Defence. It will service all the needs of the Merchant Marine and Naval Service in a unique collaborative venture between the service and the Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, an interdepartmental expert working group, chaired by my Department <Col N="1113" /> and with representatives from the Departments of Education and Science, Finance, Defence, together with CIT, the Naval Service and FÁS, examined the costings, financing and timing of the establishment of the new national maritime college. Having considered all the funding options the Government has decided that the construction of the college will be undertaken as a public/private partnership. My Department is at present consulting all the players in the shipping sector, including the Irish Chamber of Shipping, the representative bodies for shipbrokers, ship agents and master mariners, to consider how the new college can best meet their educational and professional training needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fully shares the concerns expressed about the lack of adequate conditions for free, fair and democratic elections in Peru. Together with our partners in the European Union, we have been active in conveying those concerns both directly to the Peruvian authorities in Lima and in appropriate international fora.</P>
      <P>At the recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland was fully associated with a statement made by the EU Presidency on behalf of the Union as a whole, which noted with alarm the decline in Peru of the rule of law including the deterioration in the electoral process. The statement expressed the Union's concern about the practices which seriously undermine the separation of powers, the lack of due process particularly where military penal courts of justice are concerned, disrespect for procedural guarantees, harassment of human rights defenders, of journalists and opposition political leaders, extra-judicial executions, torture and appalling conditions in detentions centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of our deep concern regarding aspects of the conduct of the Peruvian election campaign, the EU Presidency issued a further statement on 7 April, just prior to the first round of elections &ndash; in Lisbon, Brussels and Lima &ndash; drawing attention to the fact that the Union was closely monitoring the electoral process, and urging the authorities to adopt all the necessary measures to ensure that the Peruvian people could express <Col N="1114" /> their will in freedom and democracy, without undue pressure of any kind.</P>
    <P>Similar vigilance is called for in the run-up to the second round of the elections at the end of this month. Ireland, together with our partners, is closely following developments in the second phase of the election campaign, and we will be making our views known as appropriate to the Peruvian authorities, in co-operation with other friends of the Peruvian people, urging strongly that the government of Peru guarantees a fair and equitable electoral campaign and a transparent and genuinely democratic second round.</P>
    <P>The EU is working in close co-operation with the Organisation of American States which was notably vigilant in monitoring the first round of the election, and particularly robust in its comments both on the conduct of the campaign and the counting of the votes. The Government believes that democracy must be upheld, not only in Peru, but all over Latin America. It is our view that the recent progress in the consolidation of democracy in Latin America must be sustained. The conviction is at the core of our policy &ndash; and that of the EU as a whole &ndash; towards the region.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market. Recognising that in certain regions of the country, competition alone will not provide the required advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services investment, 13 projects &ndash; details following &ndash; supporting the development of advanced telecommunications networks are being co-funded under the INTERREG II and economic infrastructure operational programmes. These entail approximately 26 million euro of European funding, leveraging a further 42 million euros of private sector investment.</P>
      <P>These projects were selected following open competitive calls for projects and all are to be completed by 31 December 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some IR£120 million has been allocated to co-fund investment in advanced communications and e-commerce infrastructure and services <Col N="1115" /> under the national development plan for the years 2000-6, with IR£84 million of this amount being allocated to the Border, midland and west region. I expect to issue the first call for proposals for funding under the new NDP investment <Col N="1116" /> measures during the summer. The intention of the Government and EU in providing funding for this investment under the NDP is to promote balanced regional development and to foster a more socially inclusive information society in Ireland and its regions.</P>

      <P>The telecommunications market has been fully liberalised since 1 December 1998. The provision of leased lines is a matter for commercial negotiation between the relevant parties. Under the European Communities (Leased Lines) Regulations, 1998, the director of telecommunications regulation is responsible for assessing the relevant leased lines market, on the basis of the type of leased lines offered in a particular geographic area which may include the whole or part of the territory of the State.</P>
      <P>The director is further obliged to ensure that at least one company is obliged to provide leased lines at every point in the territory of the State. In general, charges for leased lines in such circumstances must follow the principles of cost orientation and transparency and must be independent of the type of application the users of the leased lines implement. The director may also intervene in the event of a dispute between the negotiating parties and make a decision following appropriate adjudication. I consider the powers of the director to be adequate in this regard to ensure the appropriate level of service and cost orientation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Suburban rail development in Dublin is being addressed in two distinct parts under the national development plan &ndash; a short-term strategy and a longer term development programme. The short-term strategy is set out in the national development plan and is clearly focused on maximising the use which can be made of the existing suburban rail network. It provides for a significant increase in capacity through acquisition of rolling stock, improvements in signalling and infrastructure, lengthening of station platforms and the opening of a number of new stations.</P>
      <P>The Dublin suburban rail strategic review, commissioned by CIE in 1999, and which considered development at both Lucan north and Lucan south, has recently been finalised. This sets out recommendations, including costings, for the longer term development of the suburban rail network. The study provides an important input into the work of the Dublin Transportation Office in preparing its updated transportation strategy for the period 2000-16.</P>
      <P>The DTO made a preliminary presentation of its proposed strategy to the Cabinet committee on infrastructural development and Public Private Partnerships at its meeting on 11 April last. The DTO is now proceeding to urgently complete the work on its updated strategy for early formal submission to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government has considered the DTO recommendations and the findings of the Dublin suburban rail strategic review, it will then be in a position to decide on an updated longer term transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area and on the principal projects and investment priorities flowing from that strategic decision. Substantial work has been undertaken by CIE and my Department on preparing a detailed implementation programme, listing individual projects to give effect to the comprehensive investment strategy outlined in the national development plan. The implementation programme will be updated to take on board the <Col N="1119" /> recommendations of the Dublin suburban rail strategic review and the updated DTO strategy for the period 2000-16.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>the regulations that apply in Ireland in respect of aircraft noise and heights over built up residential areas; if stricter regulations apply over London; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14153/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations that apply in Ireland to aircraft noise over built up residential areas are those which have been promulgated at European Union level. Such regulations impose common standards in all member states, including the United Kingdom. In respect of noise, the current EU directive in force is Council Directive 92/14/EEC on the operation of certain categories of sub-sonic jet aeroplanes within the territories of the member states. Council Directive 98/20/EC and Commission Directive 1999/28/EC which amends Directive 92/14/EEC are currently being transposed into Irish law.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of these directives means that aircraft are not permitted to operate at an airport within the State as from 1 April 1995, issued by the relevant authority &ndash; in Ireland's case the Irish Aviation Authority &ndash; unless there is in force in respect of that aeroplane a noise certificate, certifying that the noise made by that aeroplane is not greater than the noise levels specified in Part II, Chapter 3, volume 1 of Annex 16 (3rd Edition, 1993) to the Chicago Convention.</P>
      <P>EC Council Regulation 925/1999 on the registration and operation within the community of certain types of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which have been modified and recertificated as meeting the standards of volume 1, Part II, Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation was adopted on 29 April 1999, and came into force on 4 May last. The effect of this regulation is to restrict the operation within the European Union of hush-kitted aircraft which meet ICAO Chapter III noise levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of aircraft heights, the Irish Aviation Authority has promulgated standard instrument departure procedures to be applied by aircraft departing from airports. These procedures include noise abatement procedures and are designed to ensure that aircraft are routed away from built up areas. The noise abatement procedures comply with the standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation through its publication Procedures for Air Navigation Services. It would neither be practical nor appropriate to compare the position of London <i>vis-à-vis</i> Dublin in this respect given their respective topographies and other significant differ<Col N="1120" /> ences such as the fact that London is served by a number of airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following full liberalisation of the telecommunications market in December 1998, competition has been developing with the sector, with consequential benefits for Irish consumers and business. In addition to the traditional fixed line telephone network a number of new platforms, such as digital cable, MMDS and wireless in the local loop are providing customers with alternative sources of access to telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>There has been much recent debate concerning the local loop. On 19 April 2000 the Director of Telecommunications Regulation announced a decision mandating the introduction of bitstream access to the local loop and laying out a framework for the introduction of local loop unbundling in Ireland. On 26 April 2000 the European Commission issued a recommendation on unbundled access to the local loop. I will be introducing legislation to address competitive access to the local loop in the context of a new regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry in Ireland. In the coming weeks my Department will be consulting with interested parties on the proposed legislation.</P>

      <P>The provision of rail passenger services is a day-to-day matter for Iarnród Éireann. <Col N="1121" /> However, I understand that the company has no immediate plans to operate a commuter train service between Athenry and Galway.</P>
      <P>In this regard I note that the recently published Galway transportation and planning study, which was commissioned by Galway Corporation and Galway County Council, did not identify any potential for developing a rail commuting service on this route. In general the study recommends that the public transport strategy for the study area be based on bus rather than rail services.</P>
      <P>The company has informed me that the daily passenger numbers travelling between Athenry and Galway are quite small at the moment &ndash; ticket sales of less than 300 per week.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid £329.28 under the 1993 cattle headage scheme. This amount, which issued on 2 December 1993 and represented the first instalment of payment under this scheme, was based on 60% of the 1992 cattle headage grant of £548.80.</P>
      <P>At second instalment stage on 3 March 1994, and on completion of processing of the 1993 area aid application, it was found that the total entitlement due to the herdowner under the scheme was £288.46. As the herdowner had already received £329.28, this represented an overpayment of £40.82.</P>
      <P>Normally, producers would have been made aware of the overpayment at that time and recovery sought from other outstanding payments. However, as the person named ceased to apply under the various headage and premia schemes, full recovery was not affected.  The Department has been examining outstanding overpayments and it is in this context that the letter referred to by the Deputy issued.</P>

      <P>This year's milk quota restructuring scheme will cater, as a matter of priority, for those producers who had been dependent on temporary leasing over recent years and for those producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases. I decided to structure this year's scheme in this way following consultation with organisations involved in the industry and taking account in particular of the views of the milk quota review group.</P>
      <P>It was necessary, when deciding on the priorities for this year, to make particular provision for those producers who would be most directly affected by the change to the new regime and whose position, in the absence of priority access to quota, could be worse than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to my Department, the person named will have priority access to quota from the restructuring scheme in <Col N="1126" /> the current year as a result of his participation in the temporary leasing scheme over the past number of years. He may also be entitled to an allocation from that part of the restructuring pool not reserved for priority categories.</P>
    <P>The temporary leasing scheme will of course, continue to operate and I will announce details of that scheme at a later stage. The operation of the temporary leasing scheme and in particular the setting of priority categories will have regard to the outcome of the restructuring scheme.</P>

      <P>The lessee named applied for the suckler cow premium scheme on 26 May 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department received a leasing form on 1 November 1999 in which he sought to lease in ten premium rights from the lessor named. As the leasing form was received some months after he lodged his premium application, the lease could not be effected.</P>

      <P>Under the same EU regulations, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven are required to use at least 90% of that quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the National Reserve. In this case, the lessor named held a suckler cow quota of 34 premium rights but only used 21 of them (62%) in 1999. My Department wrote to the lessor named in January last seeking the reasons for the non-use of 90% of his quota in 1999 but no reply was received from him.</P>

      <P>The rural development plan 2000-2006, which contains proposals for a new scheme of early retirement from farm<Col N="1129" /> ing along with other measures, was submitted to the European Commission in December last and the Commission has six months from then to consider it. Formal negotiations on the plan with the Commission are now well under way, though it is not possible to indicate at this stage when the Commission will be in a position to approve it. When the plan is approved, my objective is to secure the earliest implementation of each measure including the new scheme of early retirement.</P>
      <P>The main changes in the proposed new scheme are that it does not include an obligation on the retiring farmer to have been engaged in farming as a main occupation, or on the transferee to farm as a main occupation, and that it does not require the transferee to enlarge the holding &ndash; there will be a viability requirement instead.</P>
      <P>A very large number of applications for the existing scheme were received at the end of last year because the closing date for entry to the scheme was 31 December.

      <P>The funding for all projects under the Leader II Programme was committed by 31 December 1999. All payments to promoters by groups will be completed in the period July to December of this year in accordance with the particular business plans of the Leader groups.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the time period needed by the European Commission for finalisation and adoption of the guidelines pertaining to its new rural development initiative, Leader+, and the time required for the preparation and commencement of new Leader programmes, I secured interim administrative funding for Leader groups to 31 December 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a lengthy period of consultation involving member states and including the European Parliament, the European Commission last month adopted the guidelines for Leader+. The <Col N="1130" /> guidelines outline the template for the drafting by member states of Operational Programmes to be submitted to the Commission for approval and clearance.</P>
    <P>Consultation with relevant parties is required by the European Commission in regard to preparation of the draft operational programmes and a significant degree of consultation has already taken place. The consultative process is being accelerated and a number of advisory seminars are also being arranged on a regional basis to provide information to prospective participants in the new Leader arrangements.</P>
    <P>Now that the guidelines for Leader+ are in place, I am concerned to ensure that the draft Operational Programmes for Leader+ and indeed the mainstream Leader programme proposed under the national development plan are finalised quickly and forwarded to the Commission with a view to obtaining clearance and the prompt establishment of Leader funding activity to 2006. While the European Commission procedure provides for a period of months for formal negotiation and clearance of programmes, I will be pressing for acceptance of our programmes at the earliest time possible.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the approval of our programmes, under European Commission requirements, an open invitation procedure will operate in regard to the selection and appointment of groups to deliver the Leader programmes in the period to 2006. Pending the finalisation and acceptance of our Leader activity programmes, groups cannot be appointed and accordingly, any question of retrospective grant assistance does not apply.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, Ireland is designated into two regions for Structural Funds purposes &ndash; Objective 1 (Border, Midland and Western Region) and Objective 1 in transition (Southern and Eastern Region). To draw down the EU funds allocated to Ireland, a community support framework has to be agreed with the Commission and approval of this is expected before end May. In addition, Operational Programmes &ndash; OPs &ndash; for each area of activity have to be drawn up and these were submitted to the Commission by end April and the negotiation process with the Commission is expected to take some months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the agricultural measures to be funded in the Border, Midland and Western Region <Col N="1131" /> (BMW) will operate under the Regional Operational Programme which will be managed by the BMW Regional Assembly. Following is a table showing the agricultural measures and the funding involved under this OP for the full seven year period, 2000-2006. It is not possible, however, to give details at this stage &ndash;  prior to approval of the OP &ndash;  as regards actual expenditure in 2000 but adequate funding for this purpose has been provided in the Department's Vote for this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the BMW region will benefit from investment in research and training in the agricultural sector under the Inter-Regional Operational Programmes. Substantial funding will also be available under the CAP rural development plan, which is outside the Structural Funds and which covers the rural environment protection scheme, compensatory allowances and the early retirement scheme. This latter plan will operate on a countrywide basis.</P>
    <P>The BMW region will also benefit from the food-related provisions of the national development plan that cover capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion, and human resources. It is estimated that the region will receive public funding of £116 million under those provisions over the period 2000-06.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance ( Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a long standing objective of Government to encourage people to provide for their retirement by giving them an incentive to participate in a pension scheme. In general employees in pensionable employment can contribute up to a maximum of 15% of their total earnings into a pension scheme and these contributions are eligible for a tax deduction. In addition, the employer's contribution to the scheme is allowable for the employer's tax purposes and is not considered as the income of the employee. The income derived from the investments of the pension scheme are exempt from income tax, including deposit interest retention tax. On retirement, an individual can opt to take a certain amount of his pension as a tax-free lump sum and the balance in the form of an ongoing income. To benefit from these favourable tax benefits the pension scheme must be approved by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the self employed and proprietary directors who traditionally availed of retirement annuity contracts, I introduced significant changes to the pension arrangements in last year's Finance Act. In summary, I introduced a greater degree of personal choice and flexibility in relation to drawing down benefits for the self-employed and proprietary directors and significantly increased the tax deductible amounts which the self-employed can set aside each year to fund their retirement benefits. The old rule which forced pensioners to take out an annuity was abolished and, instead, the self-employed and <Col N="1133" /> proprietary directors now have the option of choosing between purchasing an annuity, receiving the balance of the fund in cash, which is taxable apart from the initial lump sum, or investing in either an approved retirement fund, ARF, or an approved minimum retirement fund, AMRF. These funds allow the individual control over how the pension fund is invested during his or her retirement and also allows the individual to retain ownership of the fund and to pass on any balance remaining in the fund following his or her death.</P>
    <P>During the course of the past year, I received a number of representations highlighting certain issues that arose following the introduction of these new pension arrangements and also requests for an extension of the new arrangements. Consequently, following full consideration of the issues raised, I made a number of additional changes to the pension rules this year in the Finance Act, 2000. Most significantly, I introduced gross roll up for ARFs and AMRFs which means that the growth and income of the fund is free of tax as long as the money remains within the fund. Instead withdrawals from the fund will be taxed at the individual's marginal rate of tax.</P>

The requirements, conditions and benefits pertaining to that scheme are set out in Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The scheme provides relief from the payment of VAT and vehicle registration tax on the purchase of a vehicle whether for use as a driver or passenger. Six different types of disability are listed in the regulations governing the scheme. To qualify for benefit, a disabled person must satisfy one or more of the medical criteria laid down.</P>

      <P>I advise the Deputy that three reports-studies made by Irish Pensions Trust Limited (IPT) were referred to in the report of the Budget Strategy for Ageing Group: actuarial review of social welfare pensions, 1997; actuarial review of public service pensions, 1997; actuarial costing of pre-funding public service pension increases, 1999.</P>

The commission invited seven pension consultancy firms to submit proposals for the project. Five proposals were received &ndash; two consultants did not tender. As part of the evaluation of the proposals, a committee of the commission met with each firm of consultants. The commission subsequently recommended that IPT be awarded the contract, and the Department accepted this recommendation.

    <P>This was not an &ldquo;open competition&rdquo; in the sense that it was not publicly advertised. However, the tendering procedure followed &ndash; involving restricted rather than open tendering &ndash; was in line with usual public procurement procedures followed by Government Departments in relation to consultancy contracts of this nature.</P>
    <P>The final amount paid to Irish Pensions Trust Limited for this contract was £101,400, plus VAT. The additional amount of £42,200 was considered necessary by the Commission on Public Service Pensions, with the agreement of this Department, for the purpose of enabling the consultants to meet the objectives of the actuarial review. The additional cost was primarily due to unforeseen deficiencies in the availability of the data required to be collected across the public service.</P>
    <P>Report No. 3 above was included in a contract for a range of actuarial work carried out on behalf of the Commission of Public Service Pensions, commissioned in April 1999. The Department agreed, on foot of the commission's recommendation, to award this contract to IPT on the <Col N="1135" /> basis that (i) there was a particular urgency about the assignment, (ii) that as a result of its earlier work, IPT had available the range of data required and the computer software configured in a way to carry out the project, and had a detailed knowledge of public service pension terms, and that (iii) it was very unlikely that another consultant would be in a position to carry out the same work for a lesser fee. Thus, the contract, for £55,000 plus VAT, was awarded through a negotiated procedure on a single tender basis. As a result of carrying out additional work as part of the contract, a further £3,000 was paid to IPT, bringing the total value of the contract to £58,000.</P>

      <P>In budget 2000, I extended the 20% capital gains tax, CGT, rate to apply to disposals of non-residential development land. This rate applies to disposals of all development land made on or after 1 December 1999. For disposals of non-residential development land made before this date, a 40% CGT rate applied. It is long standing Government policy that on reduction of a tax rate, refunds of taxes paid at the higher rate before the date of the change do not apply. This policy remains in place.</P>
      <P>The disposal date for compulsorily acquired land is the date the compensation is agreed, or if earlier, the date the authority enters on the land in pursuance of its powers. Where farmland is disposed of as a result of a compulsory purchase order by an authority for the purposes of road widening or road building, a relief applies for CGT purposes. Where the entire sale proceeds of the disposal are reinvested in replacement farm land, the CGT liability will be deferred until the disposal of the replacement asset occurs. If less than the full sale proceeds are reinvested, relief only applies to the part of the proceeds actually reinvested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The stamp duty rate per automatic teller machine, ATM, card is currently £5 per card. However, ATM cards are exempt from stamp duty where (i) a card has not been used during the accounting period, and (ii) any card issued in respect of a deposit account where the average daily balance did not exceed £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This charge to stamp duty is levied on financial institutions which offer these cashcard accounts. <Col N="1137" /> However, section 203(8) of the 1992 Finance Act entitles the promoters of these cashcards to charge the account holders the amount of stamp duty and the financial institutions usually pass on this stamp duty charge to their customers.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the yield from this source was £8.8 million and this revenue permits the easement of taxes in other areas, most notably income tax, especially, as I have done in my last two budgets, on the elderly. I have no plans to introduce any exemptions in relation to this charge.</P>

      <P>The consulting engineers commissioned by the Office of Public Works to examine the flooding at the location mentioned in County Mayo have outlined options for dealing with some of the problems in their draft preliminary report, which also included a cost estimate for the work. While Mayo County Council agrees in principle with the proposal and has requested that the Office of Public Works undertakes to implement and fund the project, it considers the cost estimate provided by the consultants to be on the low side and has requested further technical discussions. The council's comments have been forwarded to the consultants for their consideration and I understand such discussions at engineering level will be arranged in the near future.</P>
      <P>The consultants' preliminary report also highlighted the necessity for a number of additional surveys &ndash; ecological, topographical, hydrological model studies &ndash; to be undertaken prior to the formulation of definitive proposals and the advancement of recommendations for any works. In view of the presence of an SAC at this site a full environmental impact assessment, which can take up to one year to complete, will also be required.</P>
      <P>However, pending the outcome of the aforementioned discussions, which may impact on the economic viability of the entire scheme proposals, it is not possible to progress such surveys at this time or to give any commitments as to when the scheme, if any, might proceed. The question of providing funding for the works stage of the scheme does not arise at this stage.</P>

    <P>I understand from the NTMA that tax clearance requirements were complied with in all cases. It should be noted that many of the above amounts include payments by the company concerned to third parties for services such as printing and press advertisements.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that the Civil Service Commission, the Valuation Office, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Office of Public Works and the State Laboratory placed no contracts with the company concerned. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has advised me that records of contract payments together with the identities of recipients are held on its financial management system. The original computerised system was introduced in 1992 and only holds records from that year. There is no record of any payment being made to the company concerned since 1992 under any contract. However an individual Revenue official has a recollection of attending a communications course in 1987 or 1988 which was presented by the individual identified with the company concerned. All manual records of payments prior to 1992 have been destroyed.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 151 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's economic forecasts were prepared in November 1999 for budget day. At that time growth in GNP of 7.4% was forecast for 2000. The latest information suggests that growth will be higher than this. My Department is updating its assessment of economic developments. This will be published in Economic Review and Outlook in the next few months.</P>
      <P>Ireland's economic performance is sustainable, albeit not at the exceptional rates of growth we have experienced in recent years. The reduction in the supply of labour and the tightening labour market suggests that potential economic growth will be lower in the future. Achieving our potential requires that we maintain economic stability and invest in infrastructure and human capital. We must maintain moderate inflation and competitive wage increases; the key to this challenge is to ensure adherence to the terms of the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>The position in this regard is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish law must comply. In general, unregistered persons are unable to claim a refund of VAT. Moreover, EU VAT law requires that VAT apply to telephone, ESB and other utility bills regardless of the status of the users of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those in receipt of the free telephone rental allowance, this covers the normal two monthly telephone instrument and line rental charges for a standard telephone and also provides up to 20 free call units in each two-monthly billing period. For those in receipt of the free electricity allowance, this covers the normal standing charge and <Col N="1141" /> provides 1,500 free units, that is, 200 units per two monthly billing period in the summer and 300 units per two monthly period in the winter. In addition it is possible to use the £5 fuel allowance, which is payable from October to April to cover electricity charges.</P>
    <P>The VAT on the telephone instrument and line rental charges, the 20 free call units and the free units of electricity are borne by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>There are no comprehensive cost figures available in respect of individual resorts. However the tax cost of the scheme is provisionally estimated at £250 million to £300 million and it is expected that this figure will be revised upwards when all the developments eligible for relief under the scheme are taken into account for tax purposes. Similarly, there are no comprehensive figures as yet available on the number of qualifying units constructed or refurbished under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Developments in the areas designated under the seaside resorts scheme are subject to the same planning requirements as other areas in the State and, where appropriate, certain developments could have been subject to an environmental impact assessment where the relevant planning regulations so specified. Consequently there are no specific records available on the number of developments in the resort areas that were subject to environmental impact assessment studies.</P>

      <P>All fixed property, including land, buildings and other structures, is valued for rating purposes. However the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, derated domestic property and an exemption from rates in respect of agricultural land was introduced following a Supreme Court decision in 1984. Consequently rates are now payable on commercial and industrial property only.</P>
      <P>The zoning of lands under the local authority development plans has no bearing on the valuation system for rating and the valuation code does not provide for the alteration or amendment of the valuation of lands when the zoning is upgraded. However when land is developed, whether zoned or not, it becomes liable for review or revision of valuation. Commercial and industrial developments, such as offices, shops, car parks, warehouses, yards and factories are valued and liable for rates on the assessed values.</P>

      <P>The formal transfer lists currently set up in the Civil Service relate mainly to the clerical officer grade. The numbers on the transfer lists for the main Departments with offices in County Louth and County Meath are given in the following table. There will be some duplication in that individual officers may apply for transfer to the offices of a number of Departments in the same location or to more than one location within the same Department and would therefore be included in more than one list. Any transfer arrangements applying in the wider public service, rather than the Civil Service, would be a matter for the organisations in question.</P>

      <Col N="1144" /> The increase in the debt between 1998 and 1999 reflects the accounting effect of the securities exchange programme and the absorption of FEOGA debt, IR£375 million, into the national debt. The securities exchange programme was carried out by the NTMA in 1999 in order to ensure the competitiveness of Irish Government bonds in the new euro trading environment. Under the programme old bonds with a high interest coupon were exchanged for a larger nominal amount of new bonds with a lower interest coupon close to current market rates. If the impact of these exceptional items is excluded the debt would have fallen by <i>circa</i> IR£1,360 million in 1999 &ndash; principally due to the Exchequer surplus of IR£1,192 million. However the increase in debt due to the programme will be compensated for by a reduction in debt service costs as lower coupons are paid on the increased amount of debt. In other words, the market value of the debt is not affected by the exchange of bonds. The overall effect of the programme is that the Exchequer should be able to raise funds at a cheaper rate than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>The payment in 1999 of IR£3,015 million, comprising a proportion of Telecom receipts and a contribution of 1% of GNP, to the temporary holding fund for superannuation liabilities is not reflected in the figures set out above. Legislation is being prepared by my Department for the part prefunding of future public pension liabilities. Moneys in the temporary holding fund will be utilised for these purposes upon enactment of the legislation.</P>

Ministers are determined to speed up ongoing fiscal consolidation and structural reform towards a knowledge-based full employment economy according to the orientations set by the special European Council in Lisbon, thus increasing the growth potential of our economies. The statement continued that we share a common concern about the present level of the euro which does not reflect the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the interpretation of the medical criteria governing the scheme and which are laid down in the 1994 regulations. As I have stated previously, the Minister for Finance has no role in the determination of whether a person does or does not comply with one of the six medical criteria necessary for qualification. That is a matter for judgment on the part of the senior area medical officer in the local health board. It is open to a person who is refused a primary medical certificate to appeal that decision to the <Col N="1149" /> medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. There is only one board of appeal and this helps to ensure uniformity in the outcome of the appeals process.</P>
      <P>While I have no definite date for completion of the report of the interdepartmental review group, I hope that the receipt of written submissions which are due by 26 May 2000 will facilitate the group in its deliberations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On an ongoing basis, my Department, the Irish Medicines Board and the appropriate pro<Col N="1152" /> fessional bodies monitor the situation nationally and internationally in relation to the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. The available evidence about the MMR vaccine has been examined and the advice of the national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland has been sought. All of the expert advice available to me is that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective and that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and either chronic inflammatory bowel disease or autism. This is supported by a number of well-validated studies on this issue. Recent media reports on this issue relate to an alleged association between measles and autism. However, the research concerned has not been published and so independent experts, both in Ireland and elsewhere, have been unable to examine the evidence for the statements which have reportedly been made.</P>
    <P>There have been almost 900 cases of measles to date this year and two deaths associated with the disease. In these circumstances it is especially important that the maximum number of children are protected against the disease and I would, therefore, urge parents to avail of this vaccination for their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Commission on Nursing has signalled that the future benchmark qualification for entry to the nursing profession will be a degree in nursing studies.</P>
      <P>There are currently a large number of registered nurses and midwives pursuing part-time degree courses. However, there are variations between health agencies in the provision of fee support. The priority action plan agreed between my Department and the nursing unions for the implementation of core recommendations of the Commission on Nursing includes a commitment to the introduction of uniform criteria for the provision of financial support to nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration education courses. This has provided me with a unique opportunity to create a level playing field for the payment of nursing degree fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, accordingly, decided that from 1 January 2001, nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses to continue to work in our public health service for a period of up to two years after the completion <Col N="1153" /> of the degree course. This fees initiative will continue until at least the year 2005.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult to predict with any certainty the number of nurses who may avail of this initiative, it is estimated that up to 1,500 nurses a year may do so over the next five years or so, at an additional annual cost of some £3 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 220 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, the health boards have responsibility for the provision of services, including personal assistance services, to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Health boards may also provide funding by way of section 65 grants to voluntary agencies providing such services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. The Centre for Independent Living, a <Col N="1155" /> voluntary organisation which is involved with the promotion of independent living through the use of personal assistants, provides personal assistance services using health board funding and also using the FÁS community employment scheme.</P>

There are various reasons for this, including the perceived inadequacy of the current rate of pay in respect of those personal assistant services provided or funded by the health boards.

In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I have today announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer-term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120 in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in <Col N="1159" /> the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
    <P>The Government's priority this year is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands on the scheme. I am keeping under review the scope that exists for effecting further improvements in terms of the scheme. Any increase in the rates of subvention will depend on the availability of resources and will take cognisance of the need for further improvements in services for older people.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently reviewing the Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. This review will examine the specific monetary values set out in these regulations which date back to 1993, when the regulations came into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer over the last number of years. Since the launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996, and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997 considerable improvements have taken place in this area.</P>
      <P>The two underlying principles of the national cancer strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, shaping a healthier future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Since the strategy was launched, regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area, with two co-regional directors of cancer services appointed in the North Eastern Health Board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their area and these plans were then submitted to my Department. The National Cancer Forum and Professor James Fennelly, Special Adviser on Cancer Services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area. The main areas of development included that of consultant appointments and in this context the North Eastern Health Board have had additional appointments made in medical oncology and histopathology. On a national basis, some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services. Dedicated funding for the development of cancer services has been allocated to the north east and since the launch of the strategy this has amounted to some £1.48 million. Funding is provided in this years allocation for the appointment of a consultant in palliative care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of the national breast screening programme has commenced and this phase will include the North Eastern Health Board area. At <Col N="1161" /> my request, a review of the symptomatic breast cancer services has been undertaken by the national cancer forum. I have received the report of this group, which I am considering. I propose to make funding available under the national cancer strategy to develop symptomatic breast cancer services further.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to work with the national cancer forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental group, at assistant secretary level, is currently preparing a national children's strategy. The strategy will broadly reflect the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, will be child centred and holistic in approach and will aim to improve the quality of children's lives, adopting a ten year time-frame for detailed planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. It will set out a range of proposals to advance the welfare and status of children in Irish society; address the need to develop our research and information base; recommend more effective ways of obtaining the views of children and set out proposals on how to improve co-ordination and planning in the provision of services for children.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group is representative of the Departments of Health and Children; Education and Science; Social, Community and Family Affairs; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Environment and Local Government; Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Finance; the Taoiseach's office and the Attorney General's office. The strategy will address the question of what new structures, including a national advisory committee on children and young people, may be necessary.</P>
      <P>Based on current projections, I expect that the interdepartmental group will have finished its work by next September. On completion the strategy will be submitted to Government for approval to be published.</P>

      <P>I understand that the overall circumstances of the case have been addressed in correspondence to the Deputy from the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific issue of the availability of a bed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, my Department has been aware that there has been concern over waiting times for children in paediatric cardiac surgery at the hospital. In this context a lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and advances in surgical and interventional techniques available have been cited as contributing to the increasing pressure on this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that it has been agreed that the hospital's cardiac surgical capacity should be increased and in this regard a design team for the theatre development has <Col N="1163" /> been appointed. When completed the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. In the short-term, the hospital is also benefiting from funding under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative. A sum of £700,000 has been provided in 2000 for this hospital for this purpose and a third cardiac surgeon has been approved for the hospital, with the post holder expected to take up duty in July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cancer strategy, which was published in November 1996 and followed in March 1997 by a three year action plan for its implementation, identified two principle objectives, to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, shaping a healthier future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Since the commencement of the implementation of the strategy in 1997, £40 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to the development of cancer services nationally. This investment has resulted in additional consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care.</P>
      <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service, requiring specialist personnel including for example, therapeutic radiographers, nurses with training in oncology, technical and engineering support staff. A minimum throughput of patients is required in order to maintain and develop the specialist skills required for the service.</P>
      <P>Because of these considerations and the complexity of radiotherapy services, the national cancer strategy recommended that radiotherapy services should be provided from two supra regional centres. The two centres currently providing radiotherapy services to cancer patients are St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin and Cork University Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy recommended that the case for providing a radiotherapy service from a third supra regional centre at Galway should be kept under review. I am pleased to report that the Government acted quickly in assessing that case and took the decision to provide a service at Galway at an estimated cost of some £10 million. The radiotherapy service there will be provided as part of the overall phase two development at the hospital. Tenders have been received for this development and are currently being considered <Col N="1166" /> by my Department. A decision on approval is expected very shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition to this major investment in new radiotherapy facilities, the existing services available have also been benefiting from a major injection of resources. I recently announced an important investment in radiotherapy and other cancer services in Cork University Hospital, with the allocation of £12.5 million for this purpose. The development will include a chemotherapy day unit, two state of the art linear accelerators and advanced CT simulation facilities. Together with approval for the appointment of two consultant medical oncologists, the improvements will ensure that the service for cancer patients in this area is in line with the best available internationally.</P>
    <P>The State's largest radiotherapy centre at St. Luke's and St. Anne's hospital opened in June 1998, having undergone a major redevelopment funded by a capital investment of over £20 million. Last year, two additional consultant radiotherapists were appointed to the hospital as part of the ongoing process of developing services there.</P>
    <P>In addition to this investment in existing and new radiotherapy services, I have recently established an expert group to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services nationally. I have asked the group to report to me in a short timeframe in order to facilitate early decisions on future developments.</P>
    <P>Chemotherapy services are widely available to patients requiring the service in each health board area in the country, subject to the guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of my commitment to the further development of cancer services in this country to ensure an equitable availability of services in line with models of best international practice.</P>

      <P>The individual case referred to by the Deputy concerns the eligibility criteria for payment of the respite care grant. Respite care is one of the most important services required by carers. In recognition of the importance of respite care for carers, the 1999 budget introduced a new annual payment of £200 for recipients of carer's allowance. This respite care grant was increased to £300 in budget 2000 and extended to recipients of domiciliary care allowance.</P>
      <P>Domiciliary care allowance is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department and is available to eligible children under 16 years of age. Unfortunately it is not possible for my Department to authorise payment of the respite care grant in this case as the person referred to by the Deputy exceeds the age criteria for domiciliary care allowance.</P>
      <P>From the information available to me it is not clear whether the person referred to by the Deputy has made an application to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for assistance. The determination of the eligibility criteria for carer's allowance is a matter for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and I am forwarding details of this case to that Department for appropriate attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means as a general rule. It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing <Col N="1170" /> anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>
    <P>The information requested in relation to costs is not readily available and will be sent to the Deputy directly.</P>

      <P>Approval for the appointment of two additional consultant nephrologists who will have sessional commitments with Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, the Children's hospital and Beaumont hospital was recently issued. I understand that the interview for these posts will be held in the near future.</P>
      <P>The urology service at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and the Children's Hospital is currently provided by a locum consultant surgeon. At present the post is shared by the three Dublin paediatric hospitals, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, the Adelaide &amp; Meath hospital Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital and the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. The hospitals recently submitted an application which envisaged a new structure for the post to Comhairle na nOspidéal. However, it is comhairle's opinion that the structure of the proposed post is contrary to that envisaged in its report on paediatric surgery services which issued in December 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a Council for Children's Hospital Care has been established and includes representation from the three Dublin paediatric hospitals. The council's primary role is to assist the paediatric hospitals to work with each other and with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to plan and develop acute paediatric services on a co-ordinated basis in the functional area of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chair of the Council for Children's Hospital Care and the regional chief executive of the ERHA met last week with senior officials of my Department to review progress on the council's work programme and to identify a number of priorities, including paediatric surgery, which the ERHA and the council will be addressing during this year. My Department and the authority support the council's view that the areas of <Col N="1171" /> specialist paediatric surgery merits immediate attention and that Comhairle na nOspidéal also has an important role to play in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if he will examine the drugs payment scheme introduced in 1999 in relation to complaints from coeliac sufferers who cannot get many of the gluten free dietary products on the new list which were previously available on the DCSS list; if he will amend the list to include such products; the way in which this problem can be overcome; if he will increase or create a diet allowance for such people; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment as new products become available and additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the total cost of claims reimbursed in respect of coeliac foods under the drug cost subsidisation scheme was £192,563, of which £102,588 was in respect of foods which are on the common list of reimbursable items. Of the £89,975 reimbursed for coeliac foods which are now no longer reimbursable, over £42,500 was in respect of cakes and biscuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependents may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>The position is that following his reconsideration of the matter as directed by my predecessor, the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board again decided that a definite public health need for a community pharmacy contractor agreement at Borris, County Carlow was not established under the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996. The applicant was made aware of his right to appeal this second decision of the chief executive officer in the matter and a copy of the assessment's board's report in the matter has been forwarded. The appeals procedures are now under way with regard to the fresh appeal. The determination of an application for a community pharmacy contractor agreement is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board under the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996. I am <Col N="1174" /> satisfied that the procedures in place under the regulations are reasonable and practicable.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board has indicated that no new applications for a community pharmacy contractor agreement are being invited. Unfortunately, due to an error in communications, the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board did not receive the request to reply directly to the Deputy in respect of the parliamentary question of 23 February 2000. The up to date position is as outlined in this present reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The in-patient hospital waiting lists as at 31 March 2000 in the format collected by my Department are on the following tables. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the numbers on waiting lists have fallen by 2,485 on the end of December quarter. This welcome reduction has been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions due to flu like illnesses and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I have today announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>A working group is currently being established by my Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for the further development of this service. The organisation of services for the treatment of ADHD will be considered as part of this review. The membership of the working group is currently being finalised and it is expected to commence its work shortly.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> The additional revenue of £3 million which has been provided for child and adolescent psychiatry since 1997 has been primarily for the development of consultant-led multidisciplinary teams. These teams comprise registrars in child and adolescent psychiatry, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social workers. A number of consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatry teams approved have been established with an express ADHD input, including a team in the Mid-Western Health Board, two in the Southern Health Board and one in the Western Health Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In January 1999, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, was formally established with a primary function to ensure that food produced, distributed or marketed in Ireland reaches the highest standards of food safety and hygiene reasonably attainable. In July 1999, following the commencement of Part IV of the FSAI Act, the FSAI assumed responsibility for the enforcement of all food safety legislation, responsibility for which had previously resided with a range of official agencies. Under service contracts, these agencies now act as agents of the FSAI in the enforcement of food safety legislation. The health boards, which had previously enforced food safety legislation under the European Communities (Official Control of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998, S.I. No. 85 of 1998, now act as agents of the FSAI using the same legal instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspection of food outlets comprises one aspect of enforcement. There are over 10,000 food outlets in Ireland and each outlet is subject to one or more inspections per annum. Given the <Col N="1210" /> volume of reports which arise from this, it would be impractical to formally publish each inspection report. Instead, section 17 of the FSAI Act provides for the authority to report to the Minister for Health and Children and to other Ministers at least annually on the efficacy of the food inspection services. I consider that this provides a mechanism for the FSAI to apprise Ministers should it have concerns about inspection.</P>
    <P>Legally, under article 20 of the regulations, as they now stand, an officer is expressly precluded from disclosing information secured during an inspection unless it is necessary to do so for the purpose of enforcing the regulations. My Department has recently reviewed the regulations and it is proposed to amend article 20 to bring it into line with European Union requirements to provide that an officer carrying out inspections will be bound by professional secrecy.</P>

      <P>The situation is that for appointment to the grade of clerical officer an examination of leaving certificate standard is required in most cases. In 1997, the qualifications for clerical officer were revised in consultation with local authority management and staff representatives, and the educational qualification was maintained at leaving certificate level as this was considered to represent a suitable standard of general education.</P>
      <P>An exception is provided for persons with at least two years previous permanent and pensionable service in clerical officer or clerk-typist positions in local authorities or health boards. These persons remain entitled to compete for local authority clerical officer positions irrespective of whether they have a leaving certificate. The provision made for holding internal competitions &ndash; to fill not more than 5% of clerical officer vacancies &ndash; allows serving local authority staff who do not have a leaving certificate to compete for these positions.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including responsibility for monitoring water quality, rests primarily with local authorities. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of databases of information related to the environment for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes. The functions of the agency in this regard include supervision of the performance of statutory environmental functions by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The report Water Quality in Ireland 1995-1997, issued by the EPA in May 1999, contains the most recent and comprehensive published data available in relation to the quality of Irish waters generally, including lakes. The EPA report, River Shannon, Lake Water Quality Monitoring 1995 to 1997, examines the River Shannon catchment including lakes in more detail. Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas Library. Both of the reports classified the trophic status of Lough Derg as moderately eutrophic, and noted that this was a marked improvement from its previous status of strongly eutrophic as reported for the 1991-1994 period. The improvement to the water quality of Lough Derg was confirmed in the recently published EPA report, Ireland's Environment &ndash; a Millennium Report, a copy of which is also available in the Oireachtas Library. It is understood that water quality in Lough Derg is continuing to improve. I am not aware of any legal action being taken by the European Commission in respect of Lough Derg.</P>
      <P>The Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment monitoring and management system project, which is administered jointly by Clare County Council and Roscommon County Council, is being undertaken in conjunction with a major investment programme which will upgrade the sewerage networks and waste water treatment plants at 17 of the main population centres within the catchment. Over £48 million has been allocated to the schemes, with 85% financial support provided by the EU Cohesion Fund. It is estimated on completion of all 17 schemes that approximately 78 tonnes of phosphorus will be removed at source.</P>

      <P>In July 1996 my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. Due to the concern expressed during the public consultation process on the guidelines, a statement on health and safety aspects which the Departments of Health and Children and Public Enterprise, agreed with my Department, was included as an appendix to the guidelines. Health aspects are dealt with by requiring operators, as part of their planning application, to furnish to the planning authority a statement of compliance with International Radiation Protection Association guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the independent expert group on mobile phones, the Stewart report, entitled &ldquo;Mobile Phones and Health&rdquo; to which the <Col N="1213" /> Deputy refers contains a series of recommendations relating, <i>inter alia,</i> to planning, health, etc.</P>
    <P>My remit relates to planning and I am having the report examined in this context. From an initial examination it would appear that its recommendations on planning issues are already governed by legislation and guidelines in Ireland. The recommendations in relation to the health effects of mobile phones are a matter for the Department of Health and Children while those in relation to the auditing of radiation emissions from masts and base stations are a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and I understand that those offices are examining the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard speed limit for built-up urban areas is currently 30 miles per hour. The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 indicated that changes to speed limit regimes, which were comprehensively reviewed some years ago, were not proposed in the immediate term. The priority must instead be to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.</P>
      <P>The option of revising speed limits downwards is not ruled out if enforcement of existing limits does not show good progress towards the strategy goal of reducing excessive levels of speeding by 50%. Such downward revisions could address lower speed limits, such as 20 miles per hour, in built-up areas. I intend that the situation will continue to be monitored in line with this approach.</P>
      <P>My Department is providing a record £23.5 million to the Dublin Transportation Office this year for the provision of grants for traffic management measures, including traffic calming. Increased non-national road grant allocations to urban road authorities in 2000, including special new grants for traffic management in certain larger urban areas, also provide the means for local authorities, at their discretion, to undertake these measures.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have subsequently been reminded each year in the context of the notification of non-national road grant allocations that they should continue to seek such involvement in improvement and maintenance work on suitable non-national roads. As in previous years, a portion of the 2000 discretionary grant allocation may be reserved by authorities for eligible schemes and up to 7.5% of a county council's restoration programme grant may be set aside for community involvement schemes.

      <P>The national development plan provides for a total investment of nearly £21 billion &ndash; 1999 prices &ndash; in infrastructure over the period 2000-6 and sets out a strategic framework for the development of physical infrastructure over that period. This framework will be further elaborated in the economic and social infrastructure operational programme that is at present being drawn up under the plan. It is a matter for the various implementing agencies, including Departments, local authorities and other public bodies, including the National Roads Authority, to undertake the more detailed programming of the work required and to manage the planning, design and implementation of individual infrastructure projects. This work is now well under way and every effort is being made to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of improved infrastructure throughout the country, including Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist the process, a broad ranging package of measures is being pursued under the direction of the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development to improve programme management and project delivery. The availability of cost <Col N="1220" /> effective construction industry capacity will be critical to the delivery of the infrastructure investment programmes. This issue is being considered by the construction industry forum and is also being addressed by the cross-departmental team on infrastructural development. The commitment under the plan to a definite programme of infrastructural investment over the forthcoming seven years will assist the construction industry to plan the expansion of its capacity, including through international partnerships, to deliver the ambitious programme.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Dublin Corporation operates a scheme whereby elderly home owners may offer their house for sale to the corporation at a discounted price based on their age. The vendor is then provided with rented senior citizen accommodation. The scheme is operated on a modest scale and I understand that over 200 senior citizens have availed of the scheme since 1988.</P>
      <P>The scheme allows senior citizens to move to accommodation better suited to their needs, generally with better access to services. The scheme also provides Dublin Corporation with access to under-occupied family type housing for letting to households on their waiting lists while at the same time meeting the needs of senior citizens for more appropriate accommodation. As the scheme thereby contributes to a better utilisation of the housing stock, I support it.</P>

    <P>The determination of the rents of their dwellings, and decisions as to the types of income to be taken into account in the assessment of the rents, are an integral part of the housing management responsibilities of local authorities. Responsibility for setting the terms of differential <Col N="1223" /> rents schemes was devolved to local authorities in 1986. Authorities have full discretion in these matters subject to their following certain broad principles, as follows: the rent payable should be related to the income of the tenants and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; allowances should be made for dependent children; a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners and provision should be made to accept a lower rent in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
    <P>Authorities should ensure that overall rental income reflects adequately, in so far as is practicable to do so, the management and maintenance costs of the houses under their control having regard to appropriate local factors. Each local authority has responsibility for determining its own differential rent scheme and, accordingly, any amendments of the nature proposed would be a matter for Dublin Corporation to decide.</P>

      <P>There is no disqualification for receipt of disability allowance, formerly disabled persons maintenance allowance in the case of a person who receives compensation arising from a court award and disability allowance is not taken into account by the court in assessing damages in an action for personal injuries. However, as in the case of all other social assistance payments, disability allowance is subject to a means test. For the purposes of assessing means, the proceeds of court awards are treated as capital.</P>
      <P>Under the current arrangements for assessing capital, the first £2,000 is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5% and the balance is assessed at 15%. This means that a single person can have capital of up to £38,347 and still qualify for a minimum payment of disability allowance.</P>
      <P>Following a review undertaken by my Department last year, provision has been included in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, for the introduction of a new method of assessing the value of capital for social assistance purposes, with effect from October this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new method of assessing capital will operate as follows: the first £10,000 of capital will be disregarded; capital between £10,000 and £20,000 <Col N="1224" /> will be assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital and capital above £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements a single person will be able to have capital of up to £41,999 and still qualify for a minimum payment of disability allowance, an increase of £3,652 on the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>Any further relaxation of the means test would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context in light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>Since 1996, my Department has operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and, accordingly, a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is available towards the cost of small scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme a maximum of 90% of the once off costs, inclusive of VAT, associated with the purchase and-or installation of this type of equipment can be funded. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with these systems are not provided for under the scheme. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90% of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. Priority in allocating the available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend it.</P>

      <P>A review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, was recently published by the policy institute, Trinity College, Dublin.

      <P>The possibility of introducing a special island allowance for social welfare claimants whose permanent place of residence is on an offshore island has been raised with me on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>The implications of introducing such a measure would need to be examined carefully and this will be explored by my Department in the coming months. There are a number of potential difficulties with such a scheme, including the appropriateness of having different rates of welfare payments depending on the claimant's place of permanent residence, having regard to the requirement to treat all welfare claimants in an equitable manner. While it can be argued that islanders live in particularly isolated circumstances, with associated costs in terms of travel, access to goods at cheaper prices and so on, the same is true of other parts of rural Ireland. Other difficulties include the potential employment disincentive impact of such an allowance; and the costs involved.</P>
      <P>In addition, any examination would need to take account of issues such as whether such an allowance would be payable to all welfare claimants or confined, for instance, to claimants of social welfare pensions, and the manner in which increases in respect of qualified adults and dependent children would be treated.</P>

      <P>These free schemes are already available to low-income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, currently £96 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years and £101 for a recipient aged 80 years or over, plus £30, plus any increases for a qualified adult, dependent children, living alone, as appropriate.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The new pension was introduced with effect from 5 May 2000. To qualify, a person must have at least 260 full-rate insurance contributions paid. These may consist solely of pre-1953 contri<Col N="1228" /> butions or a mixture of pre and post-1953 contributions. At least one contribution must have been paid before 1953.</P>
    <P>A person who has the required number of Irish contributions, as outlined above, will qualify for the new half-rate pension regardless of receipt of a pension from another country. If a person has insufficient Irish contributions to qualify on the above basis, contributions paid in another EU country may be used, provided the person has at least 52 qualifying contributions paid in Ireland, at least one of which must have been paid pre-1953. In these circumstances, the person would receive a proportionate pension having regard to the ratio of Irish contributions to the total applicable contributions.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body for inland waterways, was established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement and the supplementary implementation bodies agreement signed in March 1999. It has the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of certain inland navigable waterways systems throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes. Accordingly, the matter raised by him is now one to be dealt with by Waterways Ireland and I suggest that he should pursue this proposal with the agency.</P>

      <P>Salmo salar, salmon, is one of 200 animal species listed in the EU Habitats Directive. Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, did not initially propose special areas of conservation, SACs, for salmon. It was felt that the protection afforded the species through the regimes operated by the fisheries boards was sufficient to secure its conservation. However, at the Atlantic Region Biogeographical Conference held in 1999 Dúchas agreed to re-examine this matter. Dúchas is consulting with relevant bodies to finalise a list of SACs for salmon, some of which have already been proposed for other species and habitats.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar Question No. 722 on January 28 1998, <Col N="1233" /> I am aware that alcohol abuse is a major problem in some areas of Dublin City, including some stretches of the canal which are open for public amenity use. People who engage in drinking on canal property present a danger to themselves with perhaps the risk of drowning. They may also cause a nuisance or threat to local residents, walkers and other canal users. In such circumstances the assistance of gardaí is sought whenever a public order problem is reported.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, there is provision for the seizure of alcohol by the gardaí from a person who is intoxicated in certain circumstances in a public place. I believe that the enforcement of this legislation offers the best way to tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, outlaws discrimination in relation to employment, including recruitment to employment, on nine grounds, including age and race. The Act, which came into operation on 18 October 1999, provides for the establishment of an equality infrastructure, <i>viz.</i> the Equality Authority and the Office of Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
      <P>The Equality Authority works to eliminate discrimination in relation to employment on the nine grounds, including age and race, covered by the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and to promote equality of opportunity. The authority provides advice, support and free legal assistance, where appropriate, in cases of alleged discrimination under the 1998 Act. Since October 1999, approximately 4,000 queries have been dealt with by the authority. These have included queries about discrimination on grounds of age and race. It is the policy of the Equality Authority, where possible, to endeavour to resolve complaints as soon as they are received, if the parties are amenable to such a resolution.</P>
      <P>Along with the advice and support provided by the Equality Authority, an information campaign on the implications of the new equality legislation is ongoing. The staff of the authority regularly address a variety of groups, including voluntary organisations, employers representative bodies, trade unions and bodies established to combat discrimination. The services of the authority are always available to such groups on request.</P>
      <P>The Office of Director of Equality Investigations provides the main locus for redress of first instance for equality cases. The remit of both bodies will be broadened beyond the employment equality area once the Equal Status Act, 2000, comes into operation.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that there have been a number of operations carried out by the local drug unit which have resulted in large seizures of controlled drugs and cash within the Ballyfermot district. In this context, Operation Cleanstreet has been utilised in this area and, during the period 11 January 2000 to 15 April 2000 268 people have been detained under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984, in the Ballyfermot Road/Le Fanu Park area.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the local gardaí, having attended many meetings with community groups, business watch, Cherryorchard Development Council, neighbourhood watch and Ballyfermot local drugs task force, are very much aware of local concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the following measures <Col N="1237" /> have been taken by the local Garda management to address the problem: special public order patrol units are in operation from Monday to Saturday, inclusive. Patrol times are reviewed on a weekly basis for optimum effectiveness. Special operations are mounted from time to time in order to target particular areas where it is anticipated that problems may arise. For instance, last autumn &ldquo;operation lawns&rdquo; targeted the Le Fanu Road/Lawns Park area of Ballyfermot, where drug dealing and alcohol abuse were occurring. Special beats, backed up by patrol jeeps and the task force unit, were used. The local drugs unit also patrolled the area. This operation, resulted in a large number of arrests under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977. Further arrests were made for public order offences. This operation was repeated for a week last January.</P>
    <P>The gardaí in Ballyfermot are also very involved in a number of Government-funded, community-based projects, which are designed to benefit young people in the area who are likely to become involved in crime. The success of these projects is due to the hard work of dedicated local individuals with the assistance of the Garda.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Garda authorities have also informed me that monthly meetings have been held between the Garda and Dublin Corporation to discuss estate management. In 1998-99 there were 33 evictions in the Ballyfermot sub-district for anti-social behaviour, many involving co-operation between the Garda and the local authority.</P>
    <P>The first report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs identified Ballyfermot upper and lower as one of the 13 areas with the most acute heroin problem. A local drugs task force was established. Funding of £922,000 was allocated to support the implementation of the Ballyfermot local drugs task force service development plan.</P>
    <P>The Ashling Centre on Ballyfermot Road is used by the Eastern Region Health Authority as a dispensary centre for physeptone. Drug addicts from outside the area attend this centre. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has informed me that the provision of drug misuse services in the Ballyfermot area is the responsibility of the South Western Area Health Board. He has further informed me that the board will meet traders from the Ballyfermot area on Thursday, 25 May 2000 to discuss issues in relation to drug misuse services and the concerns which traders have.</P>
    <P>The CCTV advisory committee, which was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications, is considering an application which was received for a Garda CCTV system in the shops area of Ballyfermot. No application for CCTV has been received to date for the Cherry Orchard area.</P>
    <P>The community policing forum is being piloted in Kevin Street Garda Station, and a review, of the pilot scheme will be carried out to assess its merits. On completion of this review consider<Col N="1238" /> ation will be given to having this scheme extended to other areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have been assured by the Garda Authorities that crime and drug-related activity is monitored on an ongoing basis in the Ballyfermot district with a view to curbing and dealing effectively with such activity.      </P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have long been an advocate of inter-agency initiatives at the local level to combat crime and anti-social behaviour. The Garda Síochána has been extensively involved in conjunction with other State agencies and local residents in efforts to combat anti-social behaviour in housing estates.</P>
      <P>Garda community based projects were set up in 1991 to address anti-social behaviour. These projects operate in disadvantaged housing estates throughout the country. They work on the basis of multi-agency co-operation and the involvement of community residents. During my term of office, the number of these projects has increased more than threefold to 39. I expect to announce further expansion later this year as part of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and the Garda Síochána are also active in the integrated services process, which operates in four pilot areas under the direc<Col N="1241" /> tion of a Cabinet committee. All issues of concern to the community are dealt with on a co-operative basis between statutory agencies, voluntary agencies and community representatives.</P>
    <P>The recently launched city and county development boards will involve all relevant agencies in decision making relating to their areas. I understand that the Garda will be represented at chief superintendent level on these boards.</P>
    <P>Garda community policing personnel, who are present in most Garda districts, liaise with local people on the problems of their areas. Another conduit for Garda-community co-operation is the neighbourhood watch programme. There are more than 2,600 schemes, covering 410,000 homes.</P>
    <P>A further development of all these initiatives is the pilot community policing forum in the Kevin Street district in inner city Dublin. The forum includes Gardaí, Eastern Health Board, Dublin Corporation and community representatives.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that there is close co-operation between the local authorities and gardaí in relation to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act which allows for the eviction of tenants as a result of persistent anti-social behaviour.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Director General of the Prisons Service that 54 cases of attempted suicide were reported to the prison authorities between 13 January 1999 and December 1999. Tragically, six of these cases resulted in the death of the prisoner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Steering Group on Deaths in Prisons has reported that there are good policies in place and a good level of awareness among prison <Col N="1242" /> staff in relation to suicide awareness. The group noted in its report that many possible deaths are saved by the alertness and vigilance of staff. Appropriate training in the recognition and response to suicidal behaviour is provided in the induction programme for recruit prison officers. In addition, all serving staff have received familiarisation training in this area. However, despite the elaborate strategy for the prevention of suicides in prisons, the possibility of suicides in custody cannot be precluded no more than it can be precluded in the wider community, unless there is a total denial of all personal privacy to all prisoners at all times.</P>

      <P>One of the recommendations of the report was that a listening scheme, similar to that run by the Samaritans in UK prisons, should be introduced on a pilot basis. This involves training carefully selected offenders to operate as an extension of the Samaritan services on the landings of the prison.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Director General of the Prison Service that a pilot listening scheme is to be established in Castlerea Prison. The governor of the prison has met with the regional director of the Samaritans organisation with a view to implementing this scheme.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the pilot scheme will be reviewed after 18 months to two years in operation with a view to extending it to other appropriate institutions in the penal system. In the meantime, discussions are ongoing with a view to implementing the pilot scheme as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>However, the position in this instance is that the applicant was interviewed on 6 April 2000.

      <P>It would appear the Deputy is referring to the Government decision that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay agreements under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, PCW, should benefit from these deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum of 3% in their pensions. The minimum adjustment of 3% was calculated as if pay scales had increased by that percentage with effect from 1 September 1995. This percentage increase has now been applied to pensioners formerly of <Col N="1246" /> garda, sergeant and inspector rank who retired before 1 January 1993. In respect of those public servants who had received an advance payment of 1% of basic pay under a specific provision of the PCW programme, a minimum adjustment of 2% in pensions was made and was calculated as if the pay scales in question had increased by that percentage with effect from 1 May 1995.</P>
      <P>It is stated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that following Government consideration of the Report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which is expected in mid-2000, a working group of the public service unions, relevant Departments and other appropriate parties will be established to advise on the implementation of the relevant Government decisions with a view to introducing, as quickly as possible, any proposed changes in public service pensions arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the position with regard to the six persons referred to in the Deputy's question is as follows: This case was listed for hearing at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 8 of February 2000. On that date the case was adjourned further to an unspecified date for trial, and listed for mention on 29 May 2000. There are two files in this case. On 16 November 1999 at Galway District Court, the second suspect was sent forward to trial to Galway Circuit Court on 15 February, 2000. On that date the case was adjourned again to 3 May 2000, when it was further adjourned to the October sitting. On 16 November 1999 at Galway District Court, the third suspect was sent forward to trial on 15 February 2000. On that date the case was transferred to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, on 22 June 2000. On 28 February 2000, the fourth suspect was sent forward for trial to Galway Circuit Court on 3 May 2000. The case has been transferred to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and a trial date is awaited. This case was adjourned on a number of occasions before 9 September 1998, when a bench warrant was issued in the District Court for the arrest of the accused due to this person's non-appearance in court. The bench warrant has not been executed, as the suspect underwent a serious medical operation in 1997. I understand that the gardaí are currently awaiting medical reports regarding this person's health and capacity for attending court. <Col N="1247" /> The trial of the sixth suspect was fixed for 20 March 2000 at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. On that date the case was further adjourned to 11 July, 2000. I understand that the defence are requesting a further adjournment today.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the decision to adjourn cases is a judicial function and entirely a matter for the presiding judge in each case.</P>

The views of the Irish Deaf Society and of the parents they represent in regard to bilingualism as an approach to the education of deaf children including pre-school children, with Irish sign language as their first language, have already been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is also acknowledged that no single method of communication is suitable for all deaf students. In this context, the assessed needs of each individual child are of central importance <Col N="1252" /> when, in consultation with the child's parents, decisions are being made regarding appropriate educational provision.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education sets out my Department's proposals for the future development of pre-school education services for all children, including children with special needs. My Department is currently completing a process of discussion with interested parties as a prelude to putting specific arrangements in place for the development of our early childhood education services. The needs of deaf children will be fully taken into account in this context.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the issue raised by the Deputy will be among a range of matters which will be discussed at a meeting which is being arranged between senior officers of my Department and representatives of the Irish Deaf Society and the Model School for the Deaf Committee.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that each vocational education committee receives a maintenance staffing allocation from my Department to be deployed in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee's schools and other needs. In this regard the maintenance resources approved for County Roscommon VEC compare favourably with other vocational education committees with similar sized second level programmes. It is a matter accordingly for the VEC to deploy available resources in accordance with its own needs and priorities.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;Oscail', the National Distance Education Centre, was established in 1982 with the aim of widening access to programmes of study leading to qualifications at diploma, degree and post-graduate level.</P>
      <P>To attain the bachelor of arts degree the cost for a student is approximately £4,200 which includes 12 course modules and an introductory module. To attain the IT degree the cost for a student is approximately £4,900 which includes 14 course modules and an introductory module.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The open university offers all of its degree programmes in this State. I have had inquiries made to its offices and the open university indicated that the cost of an IT degree to a student from this State would be around Stg£4,500 and an arts degree would be around Stg£4,200. The costs of such courses would be reduced by around 40% for UK residents. The open university indicated that just under half of their courses also involve a residential component and that this would also increase costs. The open university operates on <Col N="1254" /> a scale much larger than the scale on which the National Distance Education Centre operates.</P>
    <P>Together with Oscail, the Higher Education Authority hosted a symposium on open and distance learning in higher education in March of this year. It is clear that there is much potential for higher education institutions to develop open and distance learning programmes in Ireland and I look forward to receiving the report on the symposium and recommendations for the development of open and distance learning in Irish higher education from the Higher Education Authority.</P>

      <P>The report and recommendations of the expert advisory group on certificate examinations in relation to the arrangements for the assessment of candidates with special needs in certificate examinations was published recently. This followed lengthy consultation and consideration by the group of this complex and difficult area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group recognised that there are cases where many of the elements of a subject that are marked in the examination are accessible to a <Col N="1256" /> student but some, because of a particular difficulty the student has, are not. An example is the aural component of a language subject that may not be accessible to a student with a hearing impairment. The group pointed out that it is reasonable that the student sit for examination in the components of the subject in which achievement was possible and that he-she be exempted from the specific and identifiable component. What this means is that the national standard for assessment should be modified to accommodate the student and this modification is enabled by including an explanatory note with the results.</P>
    <P>These measures make the examination system more flexible and responsive to the needs of students who would otherwise have difficulty with some examination subjects because of their special needs. This represents a significant advance in the inclusiveness of the examination system.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that in implementing these measures my Department will of course confine any explanatory note to the assessment issue in the subject or subjects concerned. There will be no reference to the special needs of the candidate. The note will explain only how the standard national assessment was modified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will probably be aware, my Department has in place a range of guidelines on school discipline which stress the need to regard both suspension and expulsion as sanctions of last resort. More recently, the Education Act made provision for new appeal procedures in order to address grievances in this area and my Department is working on the implementation of these at present.</P>
      <P>At present, if a parent of a pupil contacts my Department indicating that his-her child has been excluded from a school he or she is advised in the first instance to make contact with the managerial authority of the school to appeal the decision. If the matter cannot be resolved locally my Department will make contact with the school, at the written request of the parent. My Department can only attempt to resolve the matter through a process of negotiation, as it does not have the power to compel the managerial authority of a school to vary its decision. In some circumstances it may be possible to negotiate the readmission of the pupil to his-her original school or to obtain the co-operation of that school in securing an alternative school place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the approach that I have outlined is not possible, my Department will continue to seek to make educational provision available to the pupil. The way in which my Department will do this will depend on the circumstances applying in an individual case. Where the student and his or her parents are anxious that he-she returns to school, my Department offers assistance in locating a school placement and will make direct contact with schools seeking such placement. If it appears that the pupil may need additional support in order to cope in school my Department will offer the necessary additional resources to a school willing <Col N="1258" /> to consider enrolling the pupil. The national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; is available to provide advice and recommendations in such cases. When it appears likely that a young person may be out of school for a time while awaiting enrolment in another school my Department will offer a grant to the parents of the pupil towards the cost of providing some tuition for the pupil at home as an interim measure. In other cases alternative programmes, such as the Youthreach programme, can provide a young person who has been excluded from school with a suitable educational placement.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls on a phased basis, as resources permit, to all schools that do not already have access to such a facility. At present, the planning and building unit of my Department is preparing a PE hall template. This template will standardise the construction of PE halls at second level schools <Col N="1260" /> and will reduce the architectural planning process considerably. When this template becomes available, all schools that have applied to my Department for the provision of a PE hall will be considered for funding in light of available resources and competing priorities at that time.</P>

      <P>The modern languages &ndash; primary &ndash; pilot project began in September 1998, in the fifth and sixth classes of 271 schools. The pilot phase of the programme was due to end in June 2000. My Department has, however, decided to continue the pilot phase for a further year. At this stage, 287 schools are involved. Of these, 139 offer French, 72 offer German, 54 offer Spanish and 22 offer Italian.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to definitively state at this stage the number of children who are learning a language as not all of the schools involved in the project have yet submitted returns for this school year. However on the basis of the information available to my Department at the moment there are approximately 18,000 children involved.</P>
      <P>The curriculum for this programme was devised by the NCCA, which appointed an education officer in autumn 1998, for this purpose. It shares the same approach to the teaching of languages as the revised primary curriculum in Irish, namely, the emphasis is on a communicative approach. Extensive teaching materials have been devised and presented to project teachers by the seven project leaders who are responsible for the in-service aspect of the pilot project.</P>
      <P>ITE &ndash; Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann &ndash; is responsible for the evaluation of the project. This organisation employed a dedicated evaluator for the project in autumn 1998. The evaluation has run in parallel with the development of the project. The first report of this evaluation will be available in late summer 2000. The future development of modern languages in primary schools will be considered following receipt of the evaluation report by the Department.</P>

In September 1999 the remedial teaching service was extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios were advised that they could seek remedial support where they could demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
      <P>All available posts were utilised in the current school year to ensure that no primary school in the country should be without a remedial teaching service. However, I assure the Deputy that the remedial needs of St. Brigid's, Kilcoole, will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department's inspectorate is currently investigating the overall level of special needs within the school with a view to establishing whether additional resource teacher support may be required to meet the needs of the children in question.</P>

      <P>These schools have recently received <Col N="1263" /> details from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, of the outcome of a survey of radon gas in the buildings. This survey of all primary and post-primary schools was undertaken by the RPII at the request of my Department following indications of a problem with high radon levels in some schools.</P>
      <P>The results of the first phase of the three year national survey relating to 685 schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow have been issued to the schools concerned. These results indicated that none of the rooms tested in 511 schools had a radon concentration above the reference level set of 200, Bq/m3 above which remedial action is advised. Of the remaining 174 schools the RPII advised that 13 schools, showing the highest level of radon, including O'Carolan college, require attention as soon as possible. O'Growney national school is not among these 13 worst-affected schools.</P>
      <P>My Department has appointed a consultant to undertake this work. The mitigation programmes for five of these schools, including O'Carolan college, have been completed. The remaining eight schools have been inspected by the consultant and appropriate mitigation programmes are expected in my Department shortly. It is planned that the works will be undertaken during the school summer holidays.</P>
      <P>The consultant will then consider and advise on the most suitable mitigation programme for the remaining less-affected schools, including O'Growney with priority being given to the areas of greatest need. In the absence of the advice of the consultant I cannot say at this juncture when the appropriate action will be taken in O'Growney national school. While I cannot estimate what the cost of the works will be I am pleased to say that the full cost of the mitigation programme will be borne by my Department.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment in the school referred to was 508 pupils on 30 September 1999. The number of pupils required to retain the 18th mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year is 510. Accordingly, the school will lose the 18th mainstream class teacher at the end of the current school year. If the board of management of the school are confident that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 will be in excess of 538 pupils, they may apply to the primary payments branch of my Department for the allocation of a post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status.</P>
      <P>The details regarding the granting of a teaching post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status are outlined in circular 11/00, which my Department will issue to the board of management of the school in the near future.</P>

The actual entitlement of an individual school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more pupils qualify for the allocation of a full post while schools with enrolments below 600 qualify for the allocation of 0.5 of a post. However, schools which had been specifically allocated a full post by my Department in respect of remedial education prior to the commencement of the current school year retain that allocation irrespective of enrolments in the school.</P>

      <P>Details of the precise number of schools in County Sligo which have applied for a resource teacher service are not readily available in my Department. I will arrange to have this information forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The role of the resource teacher is to support children with disabilities who are attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis. The level of resource teacher support provided by my Department is based on the professionally assessed needs of the child or children involved. Resource teacher support may be allocated on a full-time basis to an individual school or to a group of schools, depending on the number of children involved and their level of need. Alternatively, where an individual or small group of children is involved, the support may take the form of a part-time hours allocation.</P>
      <P>In May 1999 my Department issued a detailed circular to all primary schools advising them of the support services, including resource teacher services, available to all children with disabilities within the primary system. The circular advised schools of the procedures to be followed in applying for such support and specified the information to be submitted in support of such applications. A total of 424 resource teachers has been allocated to date to support children with disabilities within the primary system. My Department will continue to allocate such support in response to identified needs.</P>

      <P>Twenty five special classes have been allocated to mainstream national schools countrywide for pupils with autism. A total of 29 special classes for pupils with autism have been allocated to special schools. In each case the pupil-teacher ratio is 6:1, and a special needs assistant is also allocated. In a number of mainstream schools, at primary and post-primary levels, there are individual pupils with autism who are supported by resource teachers and special needs assistants, in <Col N="1269" /> addition to their class teachers. Support services to pupils with autism are also provided by the clinical teams in the different health boards, but my Department does not have precise details of these services.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently considering the question of support services for special classes catering for pupils with autism. This includes the training of staff. The involvement of the Department of Health and Children and the parents in planning for these pupils is also being considered.</P>
      <P>The pre-service training of teachers equips them to deal with a range of pupil diversity. Students at the two larger colleges of education follow a module in special education as part of their basic teacher training. The two expert groups which were appointed on teachers' pre-service education are reviewing the need for training in this particular area.</P>
      <P>A very small number of teachers, at both levels, will work with pupils who present with autism. It is considered that the most appropriate way to meet their training needs is through the provision of specialised courses for teachers at post-graduate level.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. An agreement to this effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since then.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the breaking the cycle pilot project, schools selected for inclusion in the urban dimension of the scheme have been allocated extra staffing resources to enable them to operate within the maximum class size of 15 pupils in all junior classes. In line with the agreement referred to above, these staffing allocations are also determined by reference to the schools enrolment at 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
      <P>Due to a decrease in enrolments on 30 September 1999, the school referred to by the Deputy requires one teaching post less for the 2000-01 school year, than the number required in the current school year, to stay within the maximum class size guidelines.</P>
      <P>However, there is an arrangement in place whereby schools may contact my Department if their projected enrolments are to increase for the forthcoming school year. In such situations, my Department will re-examine the school's staffing needs based on the projected enrolments.</P>
      <P>The school in question has submitted projected enrolment figures for the forthcoming school year but the numbers do not warrant the retention of the teaching post.</P>
      <P>However, in the particular case to which the Deputy refers, I have arranged for a member of my Department's inspectorate to visit the school as soon as possible to assess the school's overall needs.</P>

      <P>My Department administers a refund of fees scheme for primary and post-primary teachers towards course and examination fees incurred by them in the successful completion of in-career development courses approved by the Department and school authorities. In the current year a fund of £210,000 has been made available in respect of courses, or individual years of courses, completed in 1999. This money is allocated on the basis that successful applicants receive the same proportion of their eligible fees. More than 400 teachers benefited under this scheme in 1998.</P>

    <P>Some 27 teachers attending the post-graduate diploma course in information and communications technology in education at the Mary Immaculate College, Limerick, have applied under the 1999 refund of fees scheme.

      <P>The memorandum to which the Deputy refers was issued in 1979 by the then secretary of the Department of Education and sought to reassure some teachers in community and comprehensive schools that they would enjoy the same rights as regards disciplinary matters as teachers employed by vocational education committees. However, as regards a sworn inquiry specific statutory powers are required before such an inquiry could be held. Teachers under vocational education committees are, as officers of vocational education committees, specifically covered by the vocational education Acts. Community and Comprehensive school teachers are not. In the absence of statutory powers, I cannot establish an inquiry as requested which would take evidence on oath and compel witnesses to attend. Any attempt on my part to do so would be <i>ultra vires.</i></P>

      <i>

While the board has agreed to participate, the teacher has refused to do so.

      <P>As part of a wide-ranging initiative introduced by my Department in March last year in the areas of physics and chemistry, a comprehensive inservice and support programme for teachers of those leaving certificate subjects is being implemented at present. Work on this programme started in summer 1999 with the appointment of two teams of trainers, seven in physics and six in chemistry, including a national co-ordinator in each subject area, and is due to continue for three years until the end of the 2001-02 school year. The training provision for the current school year, which has now been completed, consisted of a total of two and a half days training for teachers of leaving certificate physics and a similar provision for teachers of leaving certificate chemistry. Further training will be provided in the remaining years with the programme evolving to meet the identified needs of the teachers in these subject areas. This particular in-service training programme is administered by Limerick Education Centre.</P>
      <P>The process of identifying teachers of leaving certificate physics and chemistry commenced in autumn 1999 when school principals were asked to complete a questionnaire identifying all teachers of these subjects in their schools. Where no response was received schools were contacted again by means of telephone and fax to elicit this information. All teachers of physics and of chemistry identified by this process were invited to attend training meetings by way of invitations issued to their principals. Inservice training was provided during school time and required the release of teachers from school for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Invitations for each round of inservice training were issued on a local basis by the national network of education centres. For the first round, which consisted of a full-day training, 944 physics teachers and 1,031 chemistry teachers were invited to attend. This training was provided during the period December 1999-January 2000 when a total of 781 and 890 respectively attended. Following refinement of the database of teachers of physics and of chemistry, 903 physics teachers and 1,016 chemistry teachers were invited to attend the second round of training consisting of a half-day training provided during the period February-March 2000 when a total of 726 and 845 respectively attended. For the third round of in-service training, 912 physics teachers and 1,014 chemistry teachers were invited to attend. This final round for 1999-2000 consisted of a full-day <Col N="1275" /> training and it took place over the period March-April 2000 when a total of 706 physics and 833 chemistry teachers attended.</P>
    <P>Where education centres were notified that teachers were unable to attend a particular inservice meeting, efforts were made to accommodate them at another venue.</P>

      <P>All primary schools were issued with grants in October 1999 to assist them with the purchase of science teaching equipment and materials. These grants amounted in total to approximately £1.75 million. The size of grant varied with the size of school, however, a minimum grant of £400 was paid to schools of less than 50 pupils while schools of more than 500 pupils received the maximum grant of £1,000.</P>
      <P>A circular that was issued at that time indicated the types of equipment and materials that the grant could be expended upon. Schools are required to keep a record of all equipment purchased with the grant, as these records may need to be produced at a later stage for inspection by officers of the Department. However, it would not be feasible to request schools to inform my Department of the amount of money that has been spent or the items upon which it was spent, and consequently the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>

      <P>As a minimum, two days inservice, each of six hours duration, will be delivered to every primary teacher to enable the process of the introduction of science to begin in schools. This work will take place within the broader context of the curriculum area social, environmental and scientific education, which also includes history and geography. All inservice support will form part of the co-ordinated support programme which my Department has put in place to assist in the implementation of the revised primary school curriculum. The activities of the support programme will span a period of at least five years <Col N="1276" /> and courses will be delivered during the school year.</P>
      <P>A range of other activities will complement the introduction of science. Already all primary teachers have attended a two-day course entitled An Introduction to the Primary School Curriculum. During this course, the changes in emphases in the revised curriculum were outlined within a context which emphasised the approaches to learning which are being promoted across the curriculum, and included activities in science. This work was contextualised for the individual school during the school-based planning day which followed.</P>
      <P>Complementing the activities of the primary curriculum support programme, the education centre network, as part of its normal programme of activities, regularly assesses teacher in-career development needs within its catchment area. To date, a number of courses on primary science have been delivered. In addition, my Department, as part of an extensive programme of summer courses for primary teachers, will be supporting a comprehensive programme in primary science, attendance at which will be on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>An analysis of the science survey revealed a high degree of consistency among responding schools in relation to the level of science equipment available or required by schools. Accordingly, it is felt that rather than engage in protracted scrutiny of the survey results in terms of school management structures and gender breakdown of schools, it is more prudent to respond to the overall trends emerging.</P>
      <P>In this regard, in excess of 75% of schools that responded to the survey indicated that a computer was not available to the laboratory while 95% of schools indicated that a computer was not used for experimental data acquisition-analysis. These figures demonstrated that there existed a substantial need among all schools to fund the acquisition of computer equipment for use in laboratories. I have already provided funding to schools to address this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools were also asked to indicate if there was adequate equipment for the teaching of science subjects generally. In regard to the physical science subjects, in excess of 65% of all respondents indicated that there was insufficient equipment. I have provided funding to all schools that offer the <Col N="1277" /> physical science subjects to commence the process of redressing this situation.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year, a grant of £2,500 for the purchase of computer equipment was issued to schools that offer any one of the physical science subjects at leaving certificate level. A general science equipment grant of £1,500 was also paid simultaneously to qualifying schools for acquiring items of equipment for use in the laboratory. In total, £2,464,000 was expended under this grant.</P>
      <P>Decisions concerning the spending of the balance of £13 million, which was targeted under the science initiative for expending on science facilities over a three years period, have not been finalised. A special grant for the teaching of physics and chemistry of £10<i> per capita</i> in respect of pupils studying the leaving certificate subjects physics, chemistry and physics and chemistry has also been paid and amounted to £300,000.</P>
      <P>Annually, grants are paid from the second level capital allocation for the provision of new science laboratories and the refurbishment of existing science laboratories in second level schools. Since an investment in the science infrastructure of a school generally forms part of an overall project at a school, the level of capital expenditure incurred by my Department specifically on science facilities is not analysed separately.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> Minister for Education and Science </P>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): I would be seriously concerned if children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or any other special need, were being excluded from the education system. My Department provides a range of special support services to enable schools to cater for such children. In some cases, where the condition is not of a serious nature, the children are capable of being successfully taught within mainstream classes, with the support where necessary of the resource teacher service. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special needs within the primary system, including children with ADHD, now have an automatic entitlement to the supports they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
    <P>Where more pronounced forms of condition in question arise, the children have access to a range of special schools and special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at reduced pupil teacher ratios and attract extra funding allocations. The national education psychological service also plays a role with regard to assessment of children and devising educational responses for pupils exhibiting persistent and maladaptive levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of particular children who have been refused entry to the education system, he may wish to provide me with details so that I can have the matter investigated.</P>

Under the Government's plans, it is envisaged that all schools will have a fully operational educational psychological service by the end of 2004. Pending the expansion of the national educational psychological service to all schools in County Donegal, the psychological service of the North Western Health Board is willing to carry out urgent educational psychological assessments. As a result, the health board should be asked to arrange for the assessment of the student in question.</P>
