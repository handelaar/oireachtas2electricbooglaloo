    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 46, Planning and Development Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>]: Second Stage (Resumed).</P>

      <P>On the ordering of business in the House generally, on Tuesday the Government asked for statements on Northern Ireland, ruling out any questions which might have probed the Government's position on Northern Ireland. I had assumed, therefore, that the Taoiseach's statement on the subject would be full and frank. It appears that it was not if this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> is to be believed. It contains a report that the Government is extremely angry about the decision to suspend, but no such sentiment was expressed by the Taoiseach in the House. If the Government is expressing anger then the Taoiseach's position as set out to the House was not full and frank.</P>
      <P>If it is the case that the Government is angry about suspension, why did the Taoiseach not mention this in the House on Tuesday? Does the Government believe that resignation would have been preferable to suspension? Is it the Government's position that the suspension was not wrong in principle but that it should not have taken place until 7.30 p.m. and not at 5.30 p.m.? Could the Taoiseach explain the difference two hours would have made?</P>
      <P>I have supported, and will continue to support the Taoiseach in regard to this very difficult matter but if the Government requests permission to make statements in the House, the House is entitled to a full and frank explanation of the Government's position. The Government should not pursue a twin track strategy where it says one thing off the record to the press and something entirely different to the House.</P>

      <P>The story on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent </i>today citing senior Government sources creates a degree of confusion at a time when all of the parties in this House should be <i>ad idem</i> on our commitment to getting the process <Col N="1058" /> back on track and achieving a successful outcome as quickly as possible. I would like the Taoiseach to address and refute the story in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>. The alternative is a serious situation which brings into profile the gap between what the Taoiseach told the House on Tuesday and what was felt by Government officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday of last week I raised the legal concerns about the legitimacy of unilateral suspension of the Executive. Will the Taoiseach address those concerns at the earliest opportunity? The Taoiseach indicated that he was concerned and I would like him to elaborate his concerns so we can find out the legality of the current position.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair wishes to clarify the raising of matters on the Order of Business. I pointed out some time ago that the leaders of the main parties would be allowed to comment on a topical issue of the day. I am making a one off exception because of the nature of the subject, Northern Ireland, to allow the Deputy to comment. It is not to be taken as a precedent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement I made on Tuesday expressed my position and that of the Government. I do not want to add anything to that. In the House last Thursday I stated the Government's position on suspension in reply to a pertinent question by Deputy Owen. I said that the Government did not support unilateral suspension because it breached the Good Friday Agreement. It happened, however, because of the circumstances. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland acted because he felt the alternative would have created even more difficulties. There is not a row about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the difficulties which exist for those trying to report on meetings which they did not attend. Yesterday's meeting with all parties <Col N="1059" /> dealt constructively with the future. There were not any recriminations about the events of last Friday. All parties have moved on from that and everyone put their efforts into trying to find a resolution. That is what I will do. I would not alter the position I stated in the House on Tuesday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach seek to ensure that on this sensitive matter Government spokespersons, officials or senior sources do not brief the biggest national newspaper contrary to the facts? In this instance it now transpires there is a false story in that newspaper today, no doubt as a result of the activity of somebody in the State's pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's reply to the previous round of questions, will he categorically state that the story in the front page of today's newspaper is incorrect and that the Government is not at loggerheads with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there was a conflict last Friday. My position on this is on the record. However, that was last Friday and yesterday everybody committed themselves to moving on. All the parties &ndash; the two Governments, Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP, which has never been involved in this debate and which has been constructive throughout, as I said here yesterday morning &ndash; and all in this House know that recriminations and arguments over what has happened will never resolve anything and it never has.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with that. The briefing note which was used yesterday is reflected in articles today, but other matters are not reflected. I wish I had control over these matters but unfortunately I do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not read the story in the <i>Irish Independent</i> so I cannot comment. Will the Taoiseach agree that the progress made so far on Northern Ireland has arisen because of the close co-operation with the British Government and that any future progress will depend on such co-operation and that everything should be done to maintain and, if possible, increase it? Will he make available publicly and to the House as precise a record as possible on what happened last Friday in terms of the times messages were delivered and when the Governments and others became aware of certain developments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Clarity always helps in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand the Deputy's concerns, it would create enormous difficulties, which is not the way to proceed. Yesterday I stated that we agreed three fundamental principles on 25 June and that these were carried into the Mitchell review and emerged from that review to appear intact in the final report of the review dated 18 November. It is worth while for us all to work on them because they are relevant again in view of the suspension last week. They provide that we work towards getting devolved government through an inclusive Executive, dealing with the issue of decommissioning and that we work to the independent commission. When Senator Mitchell finalised his report he wrote in one of the final paragraphs that this could only be done if there was an inclusive Executive and that the arms issue could only be dealt with on the basis of the full implementation of the Agreement. He said that would have to be done in an inclusive way with all the parties playing their part by the mechanism of collective responsibility.</P>
      <P>From what I heard yesterday I can advise the House that I believe that is still the best way to address this issue. From the parties I met yesterday and the smaller parties the Minister for Foreign Affairs met during the week, I believe there is a willingness and an intention to proceed on that basis. If we continue on that path we can work our way out of this. I do not see any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Taoiseach's hope in that regard. When is the public likely to be given the opportunity to read the IRA message to General de Chastelain, which was the basis of paragraph 7 of his second report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for General de Chastelain. The document was given to my officials in Belfast at 4.30 a.m. and was passed on to me to study and to give on a confidential basis to Prime Minister Blair, which I did. I do not know who else within the British Government system saw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>With regard to promised legislation, I have two questions for the Taoiseach in the justice area. On the Courts and Court Officers Bill and the appointment of members of the Judiciary, when will the Bill be presented to the House? In the aftermath of the Sheedy case are there legislative proposals to make the Judiciary more accountable, either in the method of appointment or subsequently?</P>
      <P>With regard to the comments made in the Supreme Court on the Coroners Acts, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform established a working group on this matter in December 1998. While I understand the matter has been under discussion by previous Ministers, when will the report of the review and legislative amendments be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill will be published this session. I recently mentioned that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution submitted an excellent report last November which proposes reform of the Judiciary, including the system of appointment and other relevant matters. The report is being examined by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Hamilton report is nearing completion within the courts system and both reports will be reflected in whatever changes are proposed.</P>
      <P>The Coroners Bill arises from suggestions and proposals made in 1993 which were examined and included in a review group of 1998. I understand the deliberations of that group are nearing completion. Mr. Justice Keane's remarks yesterday to the effect that changes to the coroners legislation will be required is accepted. At issue is the need to work out the best recommendations that can be made. A report is due shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach agreed with me that he accepted the proposal by the all-party committee on the need to set up a <Col N="1062" /> judicial council to look at the conduct of judges, which was made in the light of the Sheedy affair. In view of the outrageous conduct yesterday of a judge in Kanturk District Court, would he agree that there is an urgent need to establish such a council?</P>

        <b>:</b> Yesterday's brutal murder of a retired school teacher in County Galway brings the number of people who have died in violent circumstances in the first seven weeks of the year to 11, which is unprecedented.

    <Title>Planning and Development Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Brady. Yesterday evening I referred to the difficulties within the planning system and concluded by referring to the fact that the level of confidence in the planning system will have to be restored. I made the point about the need for the public to contact local politicians or Members of the House to further their representations. I welcome the fact that the Bill will deal with at least some of these issues. The current difficulty is that applicants have to contact politicians to arrange a pre-planning meeting with planners, seek to have a decision speeded up, often to have the conditions attached explained, and in some cases to have a refusal reversed. Unfortunately, in the public mind, public representatives have a role to play in this regard.</P>
      <P>Public dissatisfaction is not just reserved for planners and officials, but also for An Bord Pleanála. I am aware of an application for two houses in my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly where an objection was raised by a third party. The council examined the objection but granted the application. The third party appealed to An Bord Pleanála, and the board refused the application, but cited different reasons from those raised by the objector. I recognise that An Bord Pleanála is within its rights in doing so, but decisions of this nature require greater explanation &ndash; a one sheet answer is just not enough.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems at local authority and An Bord Pleanála level have been caused by the huge increase in the number of planning applications. Reform of the planning laws will count for very little unless there is a corresponding approach to staff recruitment levels given the number of staff required to deal with the huge rise in planning applications. It is also very important that the Bill sets out details of how an acceptable time frame can be administered in terms of dealing with planning applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has taken time to address the issue of staff levels in various planning departments. I am glad he acknowledged in the House last week the new functions being <Col N="1066" /> given to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, and that the additional demands of the Bill in regard to some existing functions will require the allocation of greater resources and the ongoing development of planning skills. In that regard I welcome the Minister's contact with the planning school in UCD about the increased need for professional planning staff. I, and I am sure every Member who is a member of a local authority, have seen at first hand the huge increase in planning applications with no change in staff levels. I have been a member of Laoighis County Council for the past 20 years and have seen at first hand the pressures placed on planning staff. For example, there were 1,515 planning applications in 1999, 815 in 1998 and 790 in 1997 dealt with by the same staff complement. If we are to deliver the cornerstone of the Bill on time we need to be strategic in approach and be imbued within an ethos of sustainable development. To deliver performance of the highest quality there must be a serious commitment to encourage school leavers to take up a career in planning. It is important the necessary funding is provided to deliver professional planners to our local authorities. Nothing else will make the provisions of the Bill work and it will go a long way to restoring public confidence in the planning system by reducing delays caused by requests for further information.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has addressed many of the issues causing public annoyance and disquiet. Primarily, the Bill's purpose is to ensure quality development plans, quality and timely decisions and an acceptable planning service. It is important that there will be proper enforcement of our planning laws. The public demands these aspirations and the Bill will ensure that change will be put into effect to make them a reality.</P>
    <P>Statutory recognition will be given to pre-planning discussions which will help the decision making process. More importantly, it will help the applicant clarify his application and will lead to less time for decisions to be made as there should no longer be a need for further information requests because the applicant can sit down with the planners in the pre-planning stage and ensure any difficulties can be ironed out. This will ensure an immediate response from the planners. I welcome that the Bill addressed the need to reform the enforcement code and that the code will deal with genuine concerns of people living in unfinished housing estates. This has been a huge bone of contention for members of local authorities for years. The retention permission will only be available to deal with genuine mistakes such as a window or a door placed in the wrong location.</P>
    <P>For too many years we, as public representatives, have tried to explain to the public the need on the one hand for retention applications and, on the other, to convince them that while the large developer is conscious of the provision of the retention escape hatch, he has often used this for the wrong reasons. I am glad the Minister is addressing this issue. Retention applications and <Col N="1067" /> subsequent refusals for omitting to comply with a relevant planning condition have only helped to give the planning process a bad name. There has been much criticism of public representatives' support for retention applications. Part V of the Bill which deals with housing supply has been an area of greatest contention, debate and disagreement since the Minister first mentioned the proposal. This section will ensure that housing supply will become compatible with the planning system. While the Minister has often talked about the need to transfer power to the local authorities, this is the first major step in ensuring that policy because the planning development aspect of our development plan will be tied into planning; we will have a direct input into the development plan. The obvious follow on from that will be our direct input into housing supply and the arrangement throughout counties for such locations.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities will have a direct involvement in the provision of such housing because the council's development plans must contain a housing strategy, not just enough to suggest, as in the past, that there is a need in each town for a level of housing but also to ensure we prepare a development plan for a five year period. A strategic housing plan should be built into that for each town and village in an effort to tackle correctly the huge increase in waiting lists and meet the needs of the present and future population of the area. We can play a direct role by ensuring adequate land is made available for this purpose. The council's development plan must assess the needs for social and affordable housing and the mix of house types required to meet the needs of the different households must also be copperfastened into the development plan, in other words, as we prepare our plan we must ensure adequate housing supply to meet the needs of our young population. We cannot rely any longer on the yearly capital allocation of local authorities. The demands for local authority housing each year far exceeds the supply. For example, in my county of Laois this year the housing list stands at 690 and the average house approval allocation for capital schemes is approximately 60.</P>
    <P>To ensure an adequate housing supply other measures must be taken, such as the voluntary housing schemes response and the Government's proposals for social and affordable housing. The development plan must include objectives to deal with provisions for suitable housing. Specific assessments must be made by the planning authorities. It is important that specific needs be contained within the period of the plan as it will become far more serious and will have a greater impact on members of local authorities due to the fact that responsibility has been placed upon us, as local public representatives, to ensure we pinpoint the area of need throughout the county, match it with a strategic strategy and reduce our waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Based on the assessment, a percentage of land <Col N="1068" /> should be made available for social and affordable housing. The figure of 20% is fixed in here but the Minister has gone to pains to explain that 20% will not always be required in each area. As affordable housing may only be sold to eligible persons, it is important to underpin the need and strategy involved to ensure there is an income limit for people requiring houses in the main &ndash; people whose income will not obtain a sufficient mortgage to purchase or build. In the allocation, the local authority will determine the order of priority of eligible persons and will always be open and transparent in its decisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and am delighted to see the Minister's commitment becoming a reality. I will share the rest of my time with my colleague, Deputy Brady.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment my constituency colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, for putting the issue of planning at the top of his priority list. I am aware of his involvement, particularly in planning, at local government level for many years and the planning difficulties experienced in County Meath. The provisions of the Bill are welcome.</P>
      <P>Our planning system must adapt to our extensive and rapidly changing requirements. The Bill will facilitate this by ensuring the system delivers a quality service to include quality development plans, an accessible planning service and that timely decisions will be made. Policy has developed in the main by Fianna Fáil led Administrations and has facilitated spectacular progress. This progress has brought about many factors which have contributed to the increased demand for housing. Among these factors are the unprecedented economic growth, a major increase in numbers employed, low inflation, fewer people emigrating to find work and others returning from abroad to work here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is taking the opportunity to address the increasing needs in the planning area. Failure to do so would lead to stunting our economic growth because it takes too long to make decisions, although decisions reached may not always be the best or the most farsighted. This Bill fulfils a commitment given in the Programme for Government and will encompass the provisions of many local government Acts since 1963. It will consolidate the existing provisions and introduce significant changes and new initiatives, thereby revising and modernising the Acts. Ireland has one of the highest levels of home ownership in Europe. The construction industry has always been an important part of the Irish economy. Local authority planning departments have had to cope with enormous workloads in recent times. I am glad the Bill also makes provision for greater staffing in the planning area. In the context of the national development plan and its associated major investment, it is important that decisions must be made more speedily. The <Col N="1069" /> Bill will ensure sustainable development, socially integrated communities and a better mix of house types to suit demands for different sectors of the community. The provision of community facilities must also be an integral element of development. It is vitally important in the context of future development in rural areas that local authority schemes continue to be provided in our towns and villages.</P>
    <P>The Bill is another step towards dealing with the housing crisis and reducing house prices. Over the past ten years surveys have shown that the cost of building a house has not increased greatly. The biggest factor in the escalation of house prices is attributed to the cost of purchasing and developing land. As we enter the 21st century, a planning system is needed which is people oriented and in which rezoning decisions are based on the needs of communities and society at large.</P>
    <P>Planning laws must benefit citizens and communities. As a public representative at local authority level for almost 26 years I have become familiar with the problems associated with planning. The degree of development in County Meath differs from area to area. The southern part of the county is over developed while the northern and north-eastern parts, which I represent, are agricultural areas where the population has been declining for several years. There has been an inconsistent approach to the assessment of planning applications in Meath. Despite the different degrees of development throughout the county, the same criteria have applied to planning applications. This has often made it very difficult for people to understand why they could not obtain planning permission.</P>
    <P>The area I represent borders Counties Louth, Monaghan, Cavan and Westmeath. The formal percentage refusal figures taken from the Department of the Environment and Local Government's planning booklet for 1998 demonstrate how County Meath fared in relation to its neighbouring counties. A staggering 25.6% of planning applications were refused in County Meath in 1998. In Louth the figure was 8.7%, in Monaghan 10.1%, in Cavan 4.6% and in Westmeath 7.2%. Kildare also borders Meath and there was a 10.1% refusal rate in the south of the county. It experiences the same pressures from Dublin as County Meath.</P>
    <P>Local authority representatives are adopting new county development plans and it is an opportune time for us to ensure planning permission is given to ordinary young couples who are trying to provide a home for themselves. While a site and planning permission are required, young people could build houses much cheaper than having to buy them from developers in larger towns and cities. In north Meath one may reside on the opposite side of a road to a neighbouring county but if one is lucky enough to live in the neighbouring county one's chances of obtaining planing permission may be five times greater. This scenario has been difficult to explain.</P>
    <P>Unfinished estates have caused a great deal of <Col N="1070" /> distress over the years and the Bill will also address that problem. People who purchased houses in such estates were entitled to the provision of necessary infrastructure, including roads, footpaths and open spaces, as part of the contract they signed. However, in the past some builders have failed to provide home owners with proper and safe surroundings. Unfinished estates have often become a nightmare for young couples trying to rear families.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. Its provisions will solve many of the problems that have caused much frustration to citizens, local authorities and public representatives alike. The planning system has been discredited and the Minister has taken the opportunity to address the associated problems. I compliment him on this comprehensive Bill, which will greatly improve planning and development regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue but I am greatly disappointed with its contents. It lacks courage to tackle the housing crisis. It also lacks vision and contains few or no improvements, although improvements have been long awaited by the building industry and the public. It is a dismal approach to the problems that confront the nation as it undertakes the National Development Plan 2000-2006. I do not agree with the Minister that it is the most ambitious plan ever for the development of Ireland. His statement is incredible. He suggested that it strikes a balance which is right for its time but it is far from that.</P>
      <P>Even though some improvements have been made to the Bill since its passage through the Seanad, it still does not meet the commitments required in planning. I am glad at least the Minister has admitted that despite having made improvements in the Seanad, he may be able to further improve the Bill during its passage through this House. I sincerely hope he does because there is a great need for improvements.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has recognised that local authorities are the key decision making bodies in planning control and has strengthened their position. The Bill provides statutory recognition for the first time in planning law, of any submissions or observations which members of the public make to a local authority regarding planning applications. This is a step in the right direction, but a more aggressive attitude is needed to alleviate the serious problems with planning decisions. Some decisions issued by planning officers and An Bord Pleanála have been absurd. The time is right for a full reappraisal of the board's effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline one of the many unpopular decisions made by the board in recent years. An elderly lady from the Beara Peninsula applied for, and after a considerable delay, obtained planning permission from Cork County Council to erect a house on her brother's land. This lady had spent the greater part of her life working in Great Britain and had sent home her hard won earnings to help her parents and family. When she decided <Col N="1071" /> to return to her native soil and apply for planning permission for the construction of a house in her local townland, she was successful in obtaining permission from the council after surmounting considerable problems. However, a third party objected to An Bord Pleanála against the decision of the council and the board upheld that private objection from a person who was born and bred outside the State. Was that a just decision issued by An Bord Pleanála?</P>
    <P>I can instance another case whereby the people of Leap village and its hinterland in my constituency of south west Cork made an application to Radio Telefís Éireann to improve the quality of the television reception in that area; they were getting a blurred picture. RTE agreed to erect a booster mast in the area and got permission from Cork County Council to do so but, lo and behold, a solitary objector, not from west Cork, Cork city or even Munster, but from Ballycroy, County Mayo, a distance of 270 miles from the site in Leap village, appealed to An Bord Pleanála and it upheld the objection. The people of Leap village and its hinterland have been left in the doldrums on account of that solitary objection from a person who lives a great distance from my constituency who did not even know the exact location of Leap and was never in that area. Is that what the Minister calls appropriate and impartial decisions by An Bord Pleanála? Does the Minister agree with that kind of conduct on the part of a State appointed board? Is he aware of the working of that board? An Bord Pleanála has made some of the most controversial decisions on appeal ever known in this State.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to create an independent appeals commission which can review the decisions of An Bord Pleanála. It would be no harm if the Minister chaired such a commission to ensure justice would be done and to rectify the injustices that have been perpetrated on Irish society by An Bord Pleanála down through the years. How can a Minister stand over the actions of such a diabolical procedure from a State appointed board which is supposed to be impartial to everybody concerned but which upholds the objections of individuals against the will of the people? Are there provisions in the Bill to correct this serious injustice? I hope the Minister will have the decency to reply to my request on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Irish Home Builders' Association has expressed concerns about the implications of certain aspects of the Bill. While it fully supports increases in social and affordable housing, it is seriously concerned that the provisions of section 82, as amended, are unworkable, inappropriate and will cause an adverse impact on the overall housing market. It should be noted that other professional bodies and leading commentators have also expressed concerns about the effectiveness and appropriateness of the provisions of section 82.</P>
    <P>The planning system has become part of the <Col N="1072" /> infrastructural logjam in a variety of areas, including roads, public transport projects, waste, sewerage and water supply. The balance has shifted from action and implementation towards inordinate deliberation and consultation. Supply constraints have been a significant factor in the recent spiralling of house prices, and increased accommodation costs have the potential to put pressure on labour costs and to adversely affect Ireland's competitiveness. A more efficient planning system is crucial to ongoing industrial development and inward investment. Unless the planning system is streamlined with lead times reduced, the potential for successful public-private partnerships will be curtailed. A number of sectors &ndash; mining-exploration, building materials and forestry &ndash; have particular concerns about the planning process.</P>
    <P>The current legislation on planning and related matters should be streamlined. The recommendations of the Bacon report in respect of the need for higher density housing and more serviced land for residential development should be urgently implemented to alleviate the current housing crisis. Development plans should have regard to the national industrial policy framework providing sufficient land for industrial development and having regard to the need to provide the infrastructure necessary for that development.</P>
    <P>Decisive action, not words, is needed from the Minister in respect of key infrastructural projects, action such as the introduction of a fast tracking mechanism to bring forward projects and to expedite those behind schedule, and the introduction of a ministerial decree to advance key strategic projects of national importance on a selective basis should be implemented. The current review of the planning legislation should ensure the planning system positively encourages the development of public-private partnership in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Bill's proposals are similar to those operating in England. This is not true. The Bill's provisions are rigid and cannot be compared with the English system which provides that there is no provision to transfer land to local authorities at below market value. An element of affordable housing should be sought on suitable sites throughout the country, indicative targets for specified suitable sites should be set and the intention to negotiate with developers for the inclusion of an element of affordable housing on such sites should be indicated in the plan. Affordable housing is also delivered in England through bringing vacant houses back into use and encouraging the conversion of larger homes into more units. The experience in England should be incorporated into the Bill.</P>
    <P>The flexibility and mutually acceptable solutions referred to by the Minister are not reflected in the Bill in so far as all options available are based on the transfer of land, houses or sites at agricultural value. Part V of the Bill will not increase the overall supply of housing but it will reduce the supply of private housing. The <Col N="1073" /> expropriation of up to 20% of private lands, sites or houses to social housing will reduce the supply of private housing available to the market and could result in price increases in the case of 80% of houses.</P>
    <P>Part V also proposes the introduction of retrospective legislation impacting directly and adversely on house prices. This will hit the first time house buyers in particular and those on average industrial wages. The Bill fails to reduce land prices, as predicted. The Government failed to implement the totality of the Bacon report. It has made a hopeless effort to do so.</P>
    <P>Part V does nothing to deliver affordable housing to the majority of house buyers and tenants. The Bill unfairly benefits buyers of affordable housing at the expense of the other 80% of house buyers. The Bill confuses affordable housing with social housing. In certain aspects it is unworkable and could lead to a number of great difficulties, thereby causing a major slowdown in the number of new house completions. Its provisions will not provide any additional housing that would not otherwise be provided under existing conditions.</P>
    <P>I must also point out the huge disadvantage under which the planning staff of certain county councils are working. Take the example of Cork County Council which had almost 7,000 planning applications last year. The county council has an excellent planning team but it is overworked trying to meet the two month deadline for decision on most applications. The county councils throughout the country which need extra staff should get approval and finance from the Department to appoint sufficient personnel to deal with the huge number of applications they handle. There is also nothing more frustrating for people who were born and bred in the locality than to be refused planning permission because the site is too high in a level field, the development would cause excessive traffic on the local county road or for some other frivolous reason.</P>
    <P>Life in rural Ireland must be preserved. We cannot let it be turned into a wildlife park for wealthy safari tourists from all over the world. We need people in rural areas so we must grant permission for the youth in those areas to build more houses. A nation's wealth is its people. We must ensure that people continue to live in rural areas by protecting and maintaining rural schools, post offices, churches, shops and Garda stations. The fabric of rural life must be preserved.</P>
    <P>Almost half our population lives in Dublin and its hinterland. Look at the consequences of that. It takes at least an hour to drive from this House to the Naas Road due to the heavy traffic. That is the result of bad planning over the past 40 years. Satellite towns adjoin all our cities and the bright lights of the cities have attracted the youth of rural areas for many years. Bad development planning in that time has denuded rural Ireland. Decentralisation is badly needed, not amalgamation or centralisation.</P>
    <P>There is not one mile of national primary road <Col N="1074" /> in my constituency of Cork South-West, an area larger than several counties in Ireland. There is no railway system or airport in that vast area. It is time to call a halt. The fabric of rural society is being undermined by the continuation of bad planning. I appeal to the Minister to let common sense prevail and to preserve rural Ireland for the people who were born and bred there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Wallace, and the Department's officials on the work they have put into this Bill. It is a fundamental reform of planning law, as indicated by the debate in the Seanad and in this House. Indeed, I compliment the Senators on the many changes they made to the Bill.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of consultation by the Minister and his officials and this has borne fruit. Consultation at all times is extremely important in the course of planning and development, particularly for local authority representatives and community groups who are concerned by some of the development. With the economy in such good shape, development has taken place very quickly and people have been taken by surprise by the rapid development of the larger cities.</P>
      <P>One of the most important issues for me is the survival of the small town, particularly in the context of the national development plan and the granting of Objective One status for the west, Border and midland regions. More money per head of population will be spent in those regions and I welcome that. However, a major issue for small towns will be water and sewerage schemes. The Minister has provided extra money for these necessary services and the European Union has issued directives that water should be made available to areas from regional water supplies. Galway has a large number of private group water schemes but extra money is needed to secure water from the county council and city supplies.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of sewerage schemes. Many villages and towns are without this necessary facility. The Minister should increase the current small schemes limit of £250,000 because most schemes are above that figure and not enough towns will qualify. When local building contractors bring forward plans to build housing schemes in towns or villages they should be assisted by making provision for the sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal scheme is of great benefit to small towns and five towns in County Galway qualified for inclusion in it. Many towns do not qualify as a result of the population limit of 500. That limit should be looked at again by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions regarding social and affordable housing. The upper limit of 20% on the quota stipulated in the Bill is moderate. It also provides that a percentage of social and affordable housing can be provided through the private sector. This is welcome. However, it is difficult to get builders for projects, <Col N="1075" /> as the local authorities have already pointed out. The Department has allocated extra funding for the essential repairs scheme, disabled person's housing grants and the health board schemes for housing the elderly but there is a large number of applicants waiting for decisions and for work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the number of people currently in need of local authority housing is 40,000. That indicates the extent of the challenge facing us. Housing is a serious issue for young people. Economic experts predict that interest rates will rise and inflation will increase, which will add to the difficulties facing people repaying mortgages. Housing affects all aspects of people's lives. As it becomes more expensive both partners are obliged to go out to work and this raises the issue of child care and its cost and availability. This arose during the budget debate and the Minister tried to address it. I am glad we have good schemes under the social housing programme. People have bought out their local authority houses at good value prices. Local authorities have provided good sites for families on which to build houses. Another welcome development is that older houses have been completely refurbished for families, and up to £20,000 has been spent on each house.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as the Irish Home Builders' Association, the IHBA, while welcoming the fact that the Minister referred to social and affordable housing in the Bill, expressed concern that the provisions of section 82, as amended, are unworkable, inappropriate and would have an adverse impact on the housing market. It stated that other professional bodies and leading commentators have also expressed concern about the effectiveness and appropriateness of the provisions of section 82. I do not agree with this view because the Minister has been wise in the provisions he has introduced on social and affordable housing. However, we must increase the housing supply. Other speakers have referred to this and it is important. If the IHBA or the Construction Industry Federation have other comments to make on this, I would like to hear them. However, we need to increase the housing supply and the Minister is committed to doing that.</P>
    <P>It is important that local authorities play their role in the provision of housing. They have a major role to play in the granting of planning permission. I would like to see local authorities making decisions more quickly and that consultation would take place between applicants and all interested parties. It has been suggested that the farming community has a role to play in the provision of sites. One of the problems is that it is difficult to obtain planning permission in some rural areas and the farming community has played its part in that. One of the organisations which has played a major role in rural Ireland is the rural resettlement organisation. It is keen to work with the farming community and I hope it <Col N="1076" /> receives more support for its efforts to have housing provided.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling in rural areas with all the talk of new roads, motorways and dual carriageways that people are only interested in getting from A to B and moving people and goods and that the people along the route do not matter. That should not be the case. There is a great deal of discussion in my area about a proposed motorway from Athlone to Galway as part of the motorway from Dublin to Galway. Organisations such as the Tuam Town Commissioners and the Tuam Chamber of Commerce have proposed that the road from Athlone to Galway should take the shortest possible route between the two towns. They have made the point that the journey would be ten miles shorter if that direct route were taken. There is much interest in that proposal. Consultation is important.</P>
    <P>I hope the National Roads Authority decides quickly on the constraints study which is under way. I hope it takes into consideration that the new road should be accessible to towns such as Ballinasloe, Loughrea, Athenry and Tuam. That said, I know the National Roads Authority and the local authorities of Galway will also look at keeping the existing roads &ndash; for example, the N6 &ndash; in good repair. Obviously a new motorway is an exciting development and provides great potential for development if done properly. It has the advantage of not disturbing any traffic situation or existing route and it could open up the opportunity for housing developments along existing routes. Towns may even be bypassed for a second time when a new motorway is built. This is an issue which will be investigated by the NRA and local authorities and we understand that will happen before 2006.</P>
    <P>I mentioned rural resettlement and the good work the organisation involved in that area has done in bringing families to the west. I hope it receives further support. I have seen families receive poor accommodation on many occasions and that results in people going back on to the local authority housing list. A more recent development is where local authorities buy houses in good condition or they repair them; that is a most welcome development under which the rural resettlement programme will prosper. Local authorities obviously maintain these houses and families are able to buy them under the local authority tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, have stressed the importance of the Bacon report. They have provided funding in County Galway to facilitate housing. This is also referred to by the Minister in the Bill. One recent allocation of £280,000 was made for roads to serve housing in Athenry in County Galway. Athenry is in the news at present because the local club has again qualified for the All-Ireland club hurling final on St. Patrick's Day. It will not be lonely around the fields of Athenry either from the hurling point of view or, I hope, from the point of view of housing in future. It is <Col N="1077" /> a growing town which will benefit from proper planning and development, and the Bacon report allocation is an important part of that development.</P>
    <P>Another issue which flows from housing and was referred to by other Deputies is the provision of industry in smaller towns. This is important. We all know about traffic congestion in cities. What is true of Dublin is also true of many other cities and is certainly true of Galway where there is a serious traffic problem. It makes sense that, if additional housing is provided in smaller towns, industry is also provided. Decentralisation has a major role to play in providing employment in the regions. I was glad to hear the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance speak about decentralisation on a number of occasions and that the Government has said that any new agency to be created would be located outside Dublin. That is most important.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister has retained section 4 of the Planning and Development Acts and has transferred it to this legislation. It is one of the few powers of county councillors. In Galway it is mostly used for the provision of an individual house for a family. There has been a great deal of frustration in west Galway, in Connemara, where it is difficult to obtain planning permission. However, we sometimes see in county development plans that apartments and holiday homes are encouraged. I find it ironic that it can be more difficult to obtain permission for a house for a local family than for apartments or holiday homes. That is also true in parts of east Galway.</P>
    <P>It is most important that local authorities have area meetings and that there is prior consultation on many planning applications and developments; this is probably more important than any section 4. The section 4 process now involves much legal argument, so that when the manager seeks advice from the legal officer he is told that he cannot sign a section 4 motion. In the past Galway received a great deal of bad publicity regarding the use of section 4 motions, and that is why having consultation and area meetings is a better way to proceed.</P>
    <P>One issue related to the question of roads, to which I referred already, is the role of An Bord Pleanála. The Bill provides for a welcome increase in the number of board members from six to seven. It is important to get decisions quickly from An Bord Pleanála as well as from the local authority.</P>
    <P>I compliment An Bord Pleanála on its decisions regarding the protection of the environment. It has acted consistently in one area, in particular, that is in regard to mobile telephone masts. In a number of cases in County Galway it has rejected planning permissions which were granted by the local authority. In one such case, for instance, the proposal involved a mobile telephone mast overlooking a primary school playground. This is an important power of An Bord Pleanála. I welcome the fact that the board is <Col N="1078" /> dealing with these issues and I would like them to be dealt with quickly.</P>
    <P>To date in the debate, festivals have not been mentioned. I was not aware, until I was contacted by the Galway Arts Festival, that there is a framework proposed in the Bill whereby local authorities would be empowered to create a licensing system to run festivals. There is no objection in principle to creating a licensing system, but there should be a distinction between commercial and voluntary or not-for-profit festivals. In granting a licence a local authority could attach a wide range of conditions which could have serious financial implications for festival organisations. The promoters of a commercial festival or event can recoup the charges from their customers, but this option does not exist for the vast majority of community and cultural festivals freely available to the public. For example, the annual Macnas parade during the Galway Arts Festival is a huge event but it is run on a not-for-profit basis. There should be a legal mechanism for festivals which are run on a not-for-profit basis and promoted by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been raised in the context of the Bill about turf cutting. Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, turf cutting, turbary, or peat extraction is defined as an agricultural activity and it is, therefore, exempt from the requirement to seek planning permission. There is an exception for an area of greater than 50 hectares where there must be an environmental impact assessment under EU regulations. I am not interested in anyone cutting more than 50 hectares of turf here, but I hope there will be an exemption for small scale domestic turf-cutting for personal use. I would like to see the regulations to which the Minister referred introduced as soon as possible because I know he will make new planning regulations following the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The EU states that it puts people before flora and fauna, and I am sure that is the wish of all public representatives, but there is considerable concern that turf-cutting as we know it would not be allowed continue. I welcome the proposed ministerial regulations providing for an exemption for domestic turf-cutting and hope these will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I understand the European Court of Justice ruled recently that Ireland did not transpose the EU directive into national law and this is the reason we must bring peat extraction under the planning control system. The Bill redefines agriculture to remove the blanket exemption from planning permission for peat extraction.</P>
    <P>As a public representative for the past 25 years, I have found there is now an emphasis on doing things according to a plan, which is usually of five years' duration. Local authorities and Ministers are telling us to draw up plans and this is a welcome development. It gives us an opportunity to fight particularly for the small towns, whether for urban renewal relief, green town initiatives or the street landscape scheme. I hope that local auth<Col N="1079" /> orities' plans for tidy towns and schools competitions, in particular, will be made part of a policy to get young people involved in planning and development. I hope those plans will be taken on board by the Minister and the Ministers of State in the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Kitt's final points.</P>
      <P>An effective physical planning system is essential for sustainable job creation and enterprise. Changes to improve the efficiency of the system have been needed urgently for many years. Further consideration should be given to streamlining the system to minimise delays and uncertainties which can discourage enterprise and investment and reduce the competitiveness of business, especially small enterprises. Accelerated procedures should be introduced for major projects where significant employment and added-value jobs may be directly at risk.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report indicated that increased demand for housing, arising from the economic convergence with European living standards, the rapid growth in the rate of household formation, rapid economic growth, increasing employment and decreased interest rates, interacting with a relatively limited supply response in the short-term has led to spiralling house prices throughout the country, but particularly in Dublin. The huge increase in house prices is evident everywhere and the Bacon report recommendations should be taken on board in future developments.</P>
      <P>Many of the excellent provisions of the Bill have been overshadowed by Part V, the controversial part of the Bill which deals with the provision of land for social and/or affordable housing within private residential developments. The Bill directs planning authorities to prepare housing strategies within one year of the enactment of the Bill to ensure that adequate land is zoned for housing and sufficient social and affordable housing is provided in their areas.</P>
      <P>The Bill has the laudable aim of ensuring the availability of affordable housing for those whose incomes, having regard to the usual two and a half times the primary income plus once the secondary income criteria, are insufficient to enable them to buy a house in the area of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once housing strategies are adopted by local authorities, future planning applications for the construction of houses, other than for one or two houses on a site of half an acre or less, must have the permission conditioned by the requirement to sell up to 20% of the land to the housing authority for social or affordable housing. This is definitely unworkable. For example, this week one of my constituents received planning permission for three houses and one of the main conditions was that it would be for family members. He was under considerable financial pressure to sell the sites but due to the condition attached to <Col N="1080" /> the planning he could not do so. The legality of that condition is questionable. It is wrong for the local authority to impose such a condition on a planning application when it would not stand up in a court. It is bizarre that a planning authority would make the creation of a family cluster a condition in the provision of planning permission for three sites. I advised my constituent to go to the courts because he was advised to appeal that condition to An Bord Pleanála and pay £300. This is a back door approach. The local authorities should clearly establish the facts. To impose such conditions is unfair.</P>
    <P>The prices to be paid for the land by the authority will be existing use value without regard to the provisions of any current or previous development plan, if the applicant purchased the land after 25 August 1999. For land purchased prior to this date, either by contract or option, the price will be the <i>pro rata</i> price paid for by the developer. This is unworkable and is a case of passing the buck.</P>
    <P>This section alone will no doubt keep lawyers and solicitors busy as the legality of this provision will be challenged in the courts. They will make much money out of it if it remains unchanged when the Bill is finally enacted. I appeal to the Minister to delete this section and to proceed with the many fine aspects of the Bill. This is the most controversial part of the Bill given the reaction of a large number of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister's aim appears to be that builders will effectively discount the price they pay for building land to take the new constraints into account. This appears to have been a clever ploy by the Department to pass the buck from its original target, the builders, to a less well represented group, existing landowners. Farmers are, in the main, the owners of most developable land not currently owned by builders. It is perhaps not unfair to say that farming organisations will be less concerned with protecting the interests of farmers intending to sell land for building purposes than protecting the agricultural interests of active farmers. Their main focus is farming and not building. There is a partnership in that farmers with land see the viability of farming in key locations and they are now looking seriously at getting cash for land in prime locations. It is important that is so.</P>
    <P>In effect, the Government appears to be divesting the housing authorities of the responsibility they have in terms of one aspect of social and affordable housing &ndash; site provision, which is the most important of all. In future, the private sector must effectively provide housing authority sites adequate to meet their needs of up to a maximum of 20% at a cost which will represent a small fraction of the true value of the land. When local authorities require land for housing under existing legislation, they have to compensate the landowner for the true value of the land. In case the Department has forgotten, we call this procedure compulsory purchase. By bringing the <Col N="1081" /> acquisition of this land under planning law, the Department is trying to side step the need for proper compensation. That is an important point.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are not constrained as to what they do with the land. That is another point which needs clarification. There is a danger that they may use it simply to reduce the excessive waiting times on their housing lists by providing public rented accommodation rather than affordable housing sought by the Minister for the first time buyer.</P>
    <P>The first time buyer's grant of £3,000 has been in existence for many years. When houses cost £30,000, people got a first time buyers' grant of £3,000. Houses now cost upwards of £90,000 but the grant has not increased. We talk about encouraging first time buyers and the Minister was supportive of giving people additional help. That grant should be increased to a minimum of £10,000. This is one point which has been brought to my attention. The grant has not even been linked to inflation. We should be serious about helping people and providing affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the criteria, but only a limited number of people are eligible for affordable housing, particularly in rural areas. There is a criterion in regard to income levels which has not been fully established. Of the 48,000 houses built last year, only 7% were built by local authorities and other housing authorities, such as St. Pancras. The construction industry is building houses and it is best equipped to do so but there should be a partnership and we should not impose a law which is unworkable.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have traditionally been able to match the cost levels at which the private sector can construct housing. Is there a danger that the affordable or social housing units within the estates will be built at a higher cost than the private housing but still have a stigma attached to them? We must consider the integration of affordable housing. Will it be at one end of an estate or will it be interwoven with other housing? </P>
    <P>What will be the effect of the Bill, if enacted, on the supply of building land? Place yourself in the shoes of a landowner. The 1998 budget and the Government recognised the need to get landowners to sell their land for housing purposes and reduced the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20% providing planning permission, full or outline, existed for residential development on their land. After recommendations from various lobby groups, the 1999 budget extended this exemption to all residentially zoned land.</P>
    <P>Capital gains tax on commercial land remained at 40%. The Government has created a major incentive to sell residentially zoned land as one would receive full value and face only 20% capital gains tax. However, in August 1999, the same Government proposed to adopt legislation which would have the effect of ensuring that should a person sell, a developer will constrain this offer to them in the knowledge that up to 20% of the land they buy will have to be subsequently sold <Col N="1082" /> to the local authority at, effectively, agricultural land values. There is a major contradiction here.</P>
    <P>We talk about the role of the planners and the Minister spoke of the amount of development taking place. We do not have enough planners, and I am speaking from the point of view of Sligo. On the last day when planning permission should be granted, planners send it back to the applicant with some excuse to buy time. The competition is considerable and planners, who are not paid sufficiently by local authorities, are moving into private enterprise. We are talking about big business.</P>
    <P>The upper Shannon scheme affects south Sligo and 35 district electoral areas are entitled to avail of this scheme until 2002. The planners in Sligo County Council have not taken that on board. In regard to ribbon development, planning permission cannot be granted because of the effect on the skyline and not on environmental grounds, which are important. The upper Shannon scheme was intended to bring incentives to rural areas and to create investment. There should have been a directive when the Government announced the scheme to deal effectively with planners in the area so that development would be accelerated and encouraged.</P>
    <P>People can avail of section 23, owner-occupier relief, on their own homes. If they pay 44p in the £1, they can offset their tax for ten years. They are now asking if they can build a house in their own area and they put the best case forward, including submissions by architects and planners but they are told planning permission cannot be granted. Given the existing housing difficulties, we must be more lenient. There are planners who believe they are on a pedestal when it comes to planning.</P>
    <P>We talk about creating economic growth in villages and towns and previous speakers spoke about such development. However, investment is important in this regard. At a meeting of Sligo County Council last week it was indicated that ten villages are waiting for sewerage facilities. We should call a spade a spade. We talk of taking pressure off Dublin and the large urban centres but people will not move to an area if they have to put in a pure flow system or a septic tank. The cost to one village in south Sligo to install a facility is £250,000. A planning application for 60 houses has been held up in that area alone because there are no facilities. We are putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>There should be accelerated investment in facilities in villages and towns where a need has been established. There is a serious infrastructural deficit in small towns and villages. We talk about the Celtic tiger and the creation of jobs in the regions, but that has not occurred everywhere. The national development plan is seriously flawed in that regard as well. There is a need to create jobs in the smaller villages and towns. In this new millennium, people expect there to be prosperity in their areas and not to <Col N="1083" /> have to drive 50 miles and encounter a logjam of traffic, which is evident in many areas.</P>
    <P>The matter of retention permission is important. It has been much abused in the past. Retention permission plays an important role in regularising unintentional breaches of the planning code, but it should not be used as an escape hatch when enforcement action is threatened. Section 147 provides that it is not a defence to an enforcement action to apply for or be granted retention permission, after enforcement proceedings are initiated. The section also specifically states that enforcement action shall not be stayed or withdrawn because retention permission has been applied for. That is a good measure in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern is that of unfinished estates. A major case on this matter in relation to Carton Estate has been listed to be heard in the High Court in Dublin in October. Section 164 provides for the taking in charge of estates when a majority of the residents request that of the authority, through the procedures set out in the Roads Act, 1993. Where the estate is finished to the satisfaction of the authority, this can be done at any time. However, when the estate is unfinished, the authority will have to take it in charge at the request of the residents if enforcement action has not commenced within seven years of the expiry of the planning permission. There has been a derogation of responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>The matter involves road builders and some developers who have a track record of not completing work on estates and who have got away with that by forming new companies. I am pleased the Bill provides that a planning authority can apply to the High Court where it is of the opinion that permission should be refused for a development because the person who has applied for planning permission carried out a development previously and is in substantial non-compliance with the permission granted, and the authority is of the opinion that there is a real and substantial risk that the permission being applied for will also not be complied with.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also cop out in terms of retention permission and the quality of work accepted. Planners in the planning departments of local authorities grant planning permission to build new estates to builders who operate under a different company name, who have a bad track record of not completing work on estates. Planners in urban authorities use different criteria from that used by planners in county councils.</P>
    <P>I come from south Sligo. A total of 35 areas have been included in the upper Shannon scheme which will conclude in 2002. The Department must speak to the local authorities concerned and bring in the planners concerned to inform them that the objective of this scheme is to create economic activity in areas of decline. This should be done while the tax incentives are in place. I am not talking about building holiday homes under this scheme but about people who want to build <Col N="1084" /> houses in this area and drive 40 miles to their places of work, and about people who want to create commercial activity in this area. The spin-off from such development in this area is far reaching.</P>
    <P>This scheme was initiated by the Minister for Finance. There was not any co-operation between his Department and the Minister of State's Department on what should be done in regard to this scheme from a planning point of view. There is not any point introducing a major incentive to create investment by way of such a scheme if planners are not informed of it or are not prepared to assist in that regard. This scheme affords us the opportunity to create economic prosperity in areas of the country that need it. A landowner in a rural area may sell three sites for £10,000 each, while a person might pay £50,000 for a site in an urban area. This scheme will assist in spreading the housing density and will create prosperity in towns and villages and investment in services. The Minister of State spoke about ribbon development. That a small village that is seeking £250,000 has been told it has been put on a five year waiting list at a time when billions of pounds in investment is available, highlights it is a pretence for the Government to say it is concerned about village renewal and creating prosperity in areas of decline. I am talking about the development of &ldquo;new&rdquo; cities and a spatial plan that was introduced by the Government, but it does not have the guts to name the future centres of development under the five year plan until 2002. While council plans cover a six year period, given that under legislation councils may sit only for five years, council development plans should operate for a five year period.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The rural areas need help not obstacles. They do not need planners saying they are creating a skyline. We must encourage people to invest to create prosperity which, in turn, would benefit schools, supermarkets, retailers and every aspect of business. Decline prevails to a large extent in a region where there is no commercial activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Perry spoke about the rural renewal scheme and said it was introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. Its introduction arose as a result of a commitment given by the Fianna Fáil Party prior to the June 1997 election, when it said it would introduce a pilot scheme to generate new activity in areas that had suffered particularly through loss of population and lack of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My county, all of west Cavan and part of south Cavan are included in that scheme and it is very successful. At my request, the Minister for Finance came to Ballyconnell last October and spoke at a seminar where the county enterprise board and the county council invited a number of guest speakers to speak from planning and taxation points of view and a member of a firm of accountants also spoke. The Minister opened that con<Col N="1085" /> ference, which was attended by at least 400 people. That scheme is most successful in west Cavan.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of Cavan County Council, councillor Seán Smith proposed that the council should send the details of the scheme to applicants who submit planning applications from the areas included under the scheme. The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance produced a detailed booklet on the benefits of the scheme. To my knowledge those details are issued by our planning authority to each applicant in the specific designated area. It is up to people on the ground to make the scheme successful. If the Custom House or Merrion Street, headquarters of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Finance, produce an overall scheme, it is up to us as public representatives, the local State agencies and the local authorities to ensure that those worthwhile schemes benefit the people in those areas. There is no point in us asking the Department of the Environment and Local Government or the Department of Finance to do this, that or the other. It is up to the people on the ground, particularly the local authorities and the local State agencies, to ensure that every use is made of those particularly valuable schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry referred to the need to provide water and sanitary facilities in the smaller towns and villages. One of the best measures introduced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government was the scheme introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, last year, which provided special funding for smaller towns and villages. A sewerage scheme in Redhills and one in Lough Gowna in my county have been the beneficiaries of that scheme. I may be open to correction but I understand that under those schemes £80 million in funding has been approved. I understand from the Minister that scheme will be continued and that is most important.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in favour of this Bill. Planning for public services and utilities is probably one of the most important tasks faced by Government at national and local level. The human environment or, to give it another name, everyday life, and where we live that life, has to be cared for. Because it is so important and involves so many different aspects, it is vital that good forward thinking is employed. In Ireland the day to day implementation of many aspects of planning is delegated to local government bodies. They are also responsible for providing many of the associated services, such as housing, fire safety and refuse collection.</P>
    <P>In the planning area there are two simultaneous types of challenge vying for attention and demanding solutions. We must think of the big picture and the objectives and policies which inevitably will be implemented in localities, each one of which is different.</P>
    <P>We must never forget the important role we, as legislators, play in providing a framework for the development and planning of public utilities. It is <Col N="1086" /> a role which the Government takes very seriously, a fact which is evidenced by this groundbreaking legislation. The Government has shown how, when faced with a problem in any sphere, it tries to find a workable solution, not on the basis of inhuman ideology but on very practical grounds, by listening to people and discovering what they want. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has embodied this policy through his approach to this legislation.</P>
    <P>The availability of housing and proper and efficient planning to enable the commencement of the major infrastructural developments provided for under the national development plan are at the core of the legislation. There are some commentators &ndash; thankfully only a few &ndash; who say we need as little planning and as little government as possible. The attitude is that there should be just a broad and rather vague set of objectives without any mechanism to see them put into effect. These people appear to suggest the Government should just sit back and let people build whatever houses they want wherever they want, regardless of whether people can afford to purchase them. However, it is an incontrovertible fact, that where this has been allowed to happen in places such as South East Asia, Latin America and some regions of the US the result has caused many more problems.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented achievements of our economy have caused problems for those people who cannot afford decent adequate housing. Perhaps it is part of our upbringing or our culture, but we expect certain things from life and we have every right to do so. If we work hard, the next step is to buy our own home. Most of us were privileged to grow up in a safe, stable domestic environment and we want to recreate this environment for the next generation. However, couples who earn between them what would have been considered a large amount some years ago, are not able to afford the prices being charged for sometimes basic forms of housing. They are caught in a vicious supply and demand vice.</P>
    <P>Ownership of a house brings many responsibilities, but it also brings certainty and stability. We have our own four walls and our very own patch of earth that we can call &ldquo;home&rdquo;. Everyone knows that house prices seem crazy and believes something must be done. The Government is taking action in this regard by encouraging the construction of affordable housing. The amendments to the Planning and Development Bill deal with many of the problems which might arise and which some of our critics would be quick to highlight as &ldquo;major flaws in the legislation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has never been the role of central government to provide housing. This responsibility has fallen to various local government councils and corporations. They are the bodies with expertise in this area and they have been asked to develop projects to meet their local needs. Provision has been made in the legislation for joint programmes <Col N="1087" /> between local government bodies such as county councils and urban councils.</P>
    <P>The legislation seeks to solve the problem of the provision of adequate social and affordable housing through flexibility and the employment of novel strategies. Local authorities can, if they have sufficient land available, build this housing themselves. As stated earlier, they have many years of experience in this respect or they can approach a developer and come to an arrangement whereby the units are constructed by the developer and then bought by the local authority. However, one problem facing local authority planners in this regard is the lack of land for construction. This is a problem which affects local authorities not only in cities but also in rural areas. In this regard, a local authority and a developer can reach an agreement for the construction of social and affordable housing on land which does not belong to the authority. The developer will then be compensated both for the land and the cost of housing construction. By adopting such a flexible and innovative approach it is hoped that many new houses at affordable prices will be made available to the thousands of couples who are at present without a place to live and to build their hopes around.</P>
    <P>We have a very good track record in the provision of public services to inhabitants of all areas. There have been two elements which have been vital in this respect, forward and effective planning and dogged persistence in serving the needs of everyone. In recent decades we have seen roads, water and sewerage facilities being provided to isolated communities. Considerations such as simple financial cost were secondary because these facilities were aimed at helping communities to improve their lot. We must ensure that everyone knows the Government holds firm on those two essential factors in the provision of public services and utilities.</P>
    <P>The Ireland of 2000 is vastly different from the Ireland of 1950 or even the Ireland of 1975. The range of issues which must be addressed increases each year. Many of these changes are welcome. In recent decades we have gained a new understanding of the importance of the environment to our lives and to the development of society, but also to its fragility. Concern and sensitivity to environmental issues are not the preserve of any one party or group. In my opinion, the environment and progress are not incompatible. If anything, the opposite is the case. We need only consider examples of industrial decay and stagnation, particularly in eastern Europe, to see how the environment can suffer as a result of stagnation. The necessity to cater for the needs of our people and provide them with services can happen in tandem with care and sensitivity for the environment. This is called &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; and it cannot happen without proper planning. The legislation will ensure our environment is protected from short-sighted development, by requiring that all plans emanating from local, <Col N="1088" /> regional or national discussions must undergo environmental impact assessments.</P>
    <P>The industrial sector is more widespread in Ireland today than in the past. We must resist temptation to concentrate the provision of services, for either industry or the general public, in towns as opposed to villages and the wider countryside. We have a duty to ensure that dogged persistence, in terms of providing for the needs of communities, remains and is catered for. A person who lives in the countryside or in a village far from a big town, or who establishes a business in either locality, must know he or she can expect the same level of public utilities and services as someone who lives in a town. We must ensure people can choose to live and work outside large urban centres. We must do everything in our power to prevent increasing numbers of families being compelled to live in large urban areas to gain access to better services.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council has encouraged the provision of small housing schemes in smaller towns and villages. Each year, 18 to 20 single rural houses are provided as part of the local authority housing programme. As stated earlier, the provision of water and sanitary facilities to smaller towns and villages is very important. By putting in place such infrastructural development, new tracts of land will be opened up for housing thus easing congestion and other pressures in larger urban centres.</P>
    <P>The provision of services and utilities is ever-changing because the members of the public to whom these services are provided are ever-changing; their age profiles, educational backgrounds and income levels are just three factors which are in a constant state of flux. The public infrastructure, whether it is roads, water mains, sewers, electric lighting systems or whatever, needs constant maintenance. Behind all of this is the knowledge that, at some stage in the future, it will have to be replaced. This will depend on estimations of usage, based on good planning. We must see difficulties on or below the horizon before they hit us in the face or before our taps run dry.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Bill have appeared as a result of partnership &ndash; of listening to and being prepared to take on board proposals from a broad spectrum of people. Not only were submissions sought from the public before the Bill's publication, but once it had been published the process of consultation continued in the form of public meetings held throughout the country. During the debate in the Seanad, the Minister showed how he has been receptive to constructive comments and amendments. This is because members of the Government, particularly Deputy Dempsey, realise the importance of this legislation. They also recognise that people who live in this country, the consumers of public services and utilities, have a valuable say in how these are provided.</P>
    <P>It has also been realised that the residents of a particular locality who may have lived there for a lifetime or who have decided to spend their lives <Col N="1089" /> there have an undeniable vested interest in matters that affect their area. They may harbour groundless fears about certain issues, fears which can be easily allayed by listening, informing and persuading.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts in place measures to guarantee greater transparency. The public should never have to feel important issues are not being handled transparently. Everyone involved in the system is a public servant, dedicated to the public interest. Transparency can often mean keeping people informed and providing them with honest, reliable information. People care about where they live and that is why the Bill makes provision for local area plans drawn up by local people independent of, but preferably in harmony with, county development plans. It is important that people are able to rely on greater expertise in important areas which can sometimes help them see broader issues. It is also important that we nurture an environment of partnership between sections of the public and planning bodies and neither should see the other as the bogeyman.</P>
    <P>Planning permission is a difficult issue and can be fraught with unnecessary and unhelpful confrontationalism. A vocabulary has emerged which can cloud the issues. People who have concerns about specific applications may have legitimate worries but once they outline these in a coherent written form they can be branded as objectors. For the first time in Irish law, objections are being given a statutory basis which will mean that they will be taken seriously. However, much will depend on fostering the element of partnership to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Vexatious objections have often hindered the provision of jobs and services to the public, including jobs and housing, roads and necessary infrastructural developments. However, responsible observations and contributions from the public have a place in the planning process. One of the most important responsibilities of legislators is to ensure a balance in our laws so that everyone involved in the vast area of the provision of public services and utilities &ndash; providers, consumers or planners &ndash; can approach the system with confidence and can feel that their role is valued.</P>
    <P>In many ways this Bill is a milestone and a watershed, and its impact will be felt for many years. It provides a firm foundation upon which we can go forward. From speaking to Members it is clear that planning poses many difficulties in many counties. We in County Cavan do not experience anything like the level of difficulties which other public representatives experience. The planning process in County Cavan is a partnership between the council executive, its members and the public. The council has successfully encouraged development within the proper planning guidelines and has worked to ensure as wide a spread of development as is possible. Cavan County Council and Cavan Urban District Council have been to the fore in providing affordable housing. I commend the Minister and the <Col N="1090" /> Minister of State for their housing initiatives and the schemes implemented in County Cavan can act as models for other areas.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe in spreading housing developments to smaller towns and villages. I also welcome the Minister's housing allocation to Cavan County Council for the next three years. The public housing programme gives the council the flexibility to build single rural houses and to provide small housing schemes in smaller towns and villages. Such developments ease the pressure on housing markets in larger urban centres and ensure that as many rural communities as possible are made viable.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Ministers of State for introducing this important legislation which gives a firm foundation for the planning process in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This is comprehensive legislation which contains many good aspects. However, many outside commentators have focused on the questionable provision concerning the 20% social and local authority housing restriction on private builders. This measure is an abdication of the Government's responsibility in house building as it passes that responsibility on to private builders.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant decline in the number of local authority houses built over time. The waiting list is now about 40,000 people. The figure was 26,000 in 1996, so there has been an increase of 43%. Over a period there has been a scaling down in the amount of funding provided for local authorities to fund local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The success of the Celtic tiger seems to have taken us by surprise as regards planning provisions. There are significant difficulties with planning around the country, as forcefully articulated by previous speakers. In many cases there is a tendency to blame local planning authorities but the number of applications has escalated to such an extent that authorities are under tremendous pressure. I sometimes wonder how they cope. I have been a councillor for the past 15 years and we often see applications on a short-term basis. However, local authority planners have to take a more long-term view of proposals. There are times when councillors take issue with planners when they articulate their concerns about proposals without appreciating the planners' long-term objectives.</P>
      <P>People are experiencing great frustration in their attempts to build houses. There is a pressure zone within a ten mile radius of Limerick city and it is impossible for anyone to obtain planning permission for this area unless they are the son or daughter of an existing home owner and have lived in the area pre-1990. This means that people coming into the area find it extremely difficult to obtain planning permission. Where are these people to build houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limerick County Council made a submission to the Department of the Environment and Local Government seeking funding for water and <Col N="1091" /> sewerage projects which are estimated to cost £100 million between 2000 and 2010. Money has not been spent on infrastructural developments over the years. There are marvellous community organisations and myriad bodies involved in rural renewal. Councils recently established strategic policy committees. There are three Leader groups in Limerick, local authorities have set up local development committees and there are also county enterprise boards. There are myriad different organisations and vibrant communities in rural villages, but proper water and sewerage facilities are the basic requirement for the building of houses and communities. Most villages do not have such facilities and there has been a trickle down effect with regard to the amount of funding provided for this vital component. We are now paying the price for that approach. The £100 million sought by Limerick County Council would rejuvenate all the towns and villages in the county and would provide the stimulus and the impetus to create vibrant rural communities as people would be able to build houses.</P>
    <P>The problem is that we have pressure zones and villages which cannot accommodate housing because there is no adequate septic tank or sewerage facilities. As a result, these villages fall into decay and die. There are very good community organisations which are planting trees, laying footpaths, improving the structure of villages, repairing fine stone walls and so on. These villages look very well but their vitality is disappearing because they lack the essential component. Pupil numbers are declining in schools and people are moving to larger towns and to Limerick city.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Davern, recently announced a comprehensive rural development document aimed at restoring the life blood of communities. We have spoken about rural proofing, spearheaded by the Taoiseach. These are grandiose terms but these communities will die unless we provide the proper infrastructure. They are dying at present and the time, energy and finance will be misplaced unless that essential component is provided. One example is the small rural village of Fenagh. If a sewerage scheme cost less than £0.25 million in 1997 it was classified as a small sewerage scheme. However, since such schemes are now more expensive and cost more than £0.25 million, they will not be implemented until sometime between 2006 and 2010. In 1997 the community in Fenagh expected its sewerage scheme to be completed within a short time. However, that position has changed. When local representatives go to meetings in that area we are asked when the local authority will provide a sewerage scheme and when the Department of the Environment and Local Government will provide funding. We have our priorities wrong. Unless we get our infrastructure right, our communities will not survive.</P>
    <P>Where will people build houses if they must take account of pressure zones? If a person in my <Col N="1092" /> area applies to build a bungalow on a small county road which has a minimum amount of traffic, the local authority will impose a development charge of £2,500. That person must pay for the building of the house, the electricity connection fee and any road improvements outside the house. Development charges should not be imposed on first time buyers or on people building houses in rural areas where a county council road already exists and is the responsibility of the local authority. I met three people recently who decided to build on a quiet county road and who were charged a development fee by the council. That is wrong. There is no point giving the first time buyer a grant of £3,000 and then taking back £2,500. We must send out positive signals to try to bring life into our rural communities.</P>
    <P>Many people have been waiting for years for council houses. They regard the Celtic tiger as the Celtic tortoise. When I became a councillor 15 years ago elderly people and families were looking for houses. We are all aware of the social changes which have taken place in Ireland in recent years. Despite the fact that the people who now look for houses are lone parents, deserted wives, families, the elderly and those living with partners, we are still building the same three bedroom local authority houses we built 15 years ago. We should look at the Scandinavian model where a person can move from a family unit to a smaller type unit in a housing complex as they advance in years, thus creating a constant number of available houses. We should increase the number of houses we are building.</P>
    <P>In 1975 32% of the total number of houses built were local authority houses. The coalition Government was cruelly punished in the 1977 general election by Fianna Fáil's sale of the century offer to abolish road tax and rates which won it a majority of 20 seats. However, we all know that road tax was reintroduced. In 1994 12.5% of the total number of houses built were local authority houses and that figure decreased again to 5% in 1998. This has put the onus on private developers to build houses. However, we are now telling private developers that if they buy land in future they must keep part of it available for 20% of the people who need housing.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note what the experts say about this new development. Peter Bacon stated: </P>
    <P>Such a rigid approach is not considered desirable. There are a number of serious shortcomings associated with a prescriptive approach.</P>
    <P>DKM Economic Consultants stated:</P>
    <P>On the demand side the 20% rule will attract people into the market who were not in the market beforehand and are now eligible based on the income criteria. The result has to be higher house prices for the 80% who are not eligible.</P>
    <P>I listened to a previous speaker who paid tribute to the Government for trying to reduce the price <Col N="1093" /> of houses. However, the price of houses has escalated and will continue to escalate as a result of this Bill.  As regards the planning process, it could take up to eight weeks at present to get planning permission because of the volume of applications. After eight weeks the applicant could be asked for extra information. They then contact their local representative out of frustration to see if the process can be expedited. While it is good that the Minister is trying to reduce this time frame to four weeks, it could roll on for a further four weeks. He should increase the number of applications being processed by providing sufficient resources and finance. Local authorities are finding it difficult to recruit people to work in the planning process. The Minister's objective is laudable but resources will be required to deal with the escalating number of planning applications.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify if something can be to prevent the pink planning notices displayed on the sides of the road from fading? Planning notices should be legible. People often do not know who is applying for planning permission. This must be clear, particularly if they want to object to a development being built beside them. If they object to the planning application, they must pay a small fee of £20. If they do not do so, they cannot object to An Bord Pleanála once planning permission has been granted. We all know there are spurious and credible objections.</P>
    <P>People are sometimes deceptive about planning applications. If they do not want others to know they are applying for planning permission, they will not advertise in their local or provincial newspapers, such as the<i> Limerick Leader</i>, but in the national newspapers and they will sometimes do so in the Irish language. I have respect for the Irish language but in many cases it is used to deceive people. If people do not see the planning notice in the newspapers, they will not object to it. Planning notices should be written in Irish and in English and it should be compulsory to advertise in a local newspaper. This may be an extra expense but it is the only way to be transparent.</P>
    <P>Yesterday An Bord Pleanála overturned a council decision on a development with which I am familiar because I helped the person to draft the correspondence to the council. It is a pity the council does not listen to the constructive and sometimes good advice of councillors. We know the community we serve better than many people in council offices. Many of the applications we handle as public representatives end up within the statutory remit of the county manager. We try to advise people on how to approach the planning process and how to anticipate the questions they will be asked. I am sometimes mystified by these questions. Disputes can arise about the bricks to be used or the colour and type of roof slates.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a county council which never had section 4 applications. They were a disaster for the State. The results of the planning process in the past are plainly visible in any of the tourism locations in the west. I am glad we never had such <Col N="1094" /> applications; we never had the situation where people would go to a Fianna Fáil councillor if a Fine Gael councillor refused them. All of us were on the same wavelength and we told each person that there was no point in making a section 4 application if we felt they would not get planning permission. The section 4 applications appear to be a thing of the past as a result of High Court decisions and that is welcome. They were not good for the State.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about certain aspects of the Planning and Development Bill. We must wait to judge the provision for a 20% social allocation of development land and the imposition on private developers to ensure that people who apply to local authorities would have a chance to get a house on a particular estate. There will be much discussion of this before the Bill is passed. Many representations have been made by the House Builders Association about this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The involvement of credit unions in housing is an innovation. There was a meeting in Santry recently which was attended by 1,000 people. St. Joseph's Credit Union had decided to become involved in building houses for its members, particularly first time buyers. The credit union purchased the land to build houses at a price which was affordable for its members. Larger credit unions should look at that as a role model. If we are to build the number of houses required for continuing economic success, there must be innovation. The House has discussed credit unions this week and this is an sector in which they could become involved in a positive and co-operative manner. If the leadership of the credit unions shows the innovation which it has in the past, this is a sensible step to take. I was approached by a credit union director in Limerick who told me about the idea. He said he hoped that other credit unions would go in this direction. Between private house builders, local authorities and innovations such as this one on the part of the credit unions, we can supply the houses the community requires.</P>
    <P>Much thought has gone into this Bill. It has good aspects which will help the planning process in future but extra staff and considerable financial resources are needed if the planning authorities are to cope with the demands which will be placed on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill. In doing so we can encompass the entire housing issue. This is a problem the Government inherited and the Opposition has recently been trying to play politics with the issue. When Fianna Fáil was in Opposition prior to 1997 we spoke <i>ad nauseam</i> about the need to do something to address the escalating problems. In 1997 there was a change of Government and the Bacon report was commissioned immediately. The Government acted on the report by making funding available for the serviced land initiative to provide infrastructure which would open up land for residential development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> That, however, was not enough. Coupled with low interest rates and a booming economy, house prices have escalated. We now find that people earning what would have been considered a very good salary find it almost impossible to enter the housing market. We are trying to address that and this Bill is part of the process.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest failures of recent times was the lack of foresight displayed by Governments and the planning departments of local authorities. The most serious problem with regard to housing is the lack of land coming on to the market for residential development. Planners must do more than look at development plans. They must look at demographic trends and address the needs caused by population growth and project those needs into the future. Very few county councils addressed that or even attempted to calculate for the future. They are only addressing the problems now because the Government has instructed them to look again at county development plans so that remedial action can be taken to release some development land on to the market. We can talk about this Bill, interest rates and all the other issues which affect house prices, but until development land is made available by county councils through their development plans we will get nowhere.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive Bill which consolidates much of the existing planning legislation. It streamlines the planning process. At present applicants approach their local authority and apply for planning permission for a house &ndash; probably the most important purchase they will ever make. After eight weeks the council writes to them to request additional information. At the bottom of the letter it is stated that this is a renewal of application and it will be another two months before a decision is reached. Every person who applies for planning permission for a house should be entitled to meet the planner to discuss the issue. There are planners who will not meet the public or their representatives who may be trying to make representations on their behalf. If someone applies for planning permission for a house they are entitled to courtesy from the local authority and should have an opportunity for a 15 minute meeting with a planning official to discuss the merits of his application as opposed to getting a refusal four months after the initial application and having to find another site and to reapply, only to be treated the same way. We must address this.</P>
    <P>There should be more planning officials and they must be more open, accountable and courteous. Planners are looking at applications every day but behind each application there is a story. The Bill must address this issue. More resources have been allocated to An Bord Pleanála to speed up the appeals process, but at local authority level, where planning applications are initiated, we must ensure that individual applicants are dealt with in a fair manner. It must be borne in mind <Col N="1096" /> that while there is a coherent strategy to planning and while planners have an obligation to ensure sustainable development, individual applicants are only concerned with securing planning permission for themselves.</P>
    <P>I have major concerns with the issue of green belts. We should stop urban sprawl. Dublin now transcends Counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow and there is almost one large conurbation stretching from Bray to south County Meath. However, surely there are pockets of land which are peripheral to the smaller towns and cities such as Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway, where services are already in place. With a small bit of vision and foresight the planning officials acting in conjunction with local authority members could rezone some parts of that land. It would help to alleviate urban sprawl.</P>
    <P>Almost £100 million is being spent on the provision of a new sewage treatment plant for the whole of Cork city. It will clean up the River Lee &ndash; we are told we will be able to swim in it again. However, the towns five, six and seven miles out of the city will not be linked to the plant, despite the fact that there is a line around the city which the council is adamant must be retained as a green belt. Cork is not a large city &ndash; the maximum distance from one side to the other is two and a half miles. More rezoning around the city would open up huge tracts of land where sewers and other facilities, such as bus services, access to schools and third level institutions and shopping centres, are in place.</P>
    <P>Measures such as this would address problems experienced in Cork and other parts of the country and they would not result in urban sprawl. In their absence the green belt is capitulating to development in a piecemeal fashion, with the result that there is no coherent plan. It means that in the case of Cork there will be a poorly thought out suburban ring around the city centre. Ministers should use whatever powers of persuasion are at their disposal to persuade planners and decision makers to look at this issue.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand some of the decisions on rural Ireland made by county councillors and planning officials. The population of the island in 1845 was approximately 8.5 million people, yet the population of Dublin was only 30,000 to 40,000. There was no proper biocycle systems nor rural water supplies, yet people lived in the countryside. However, today despite the provision of modern septic tanks, biocycle systems, sewerage and water facilities, people are unable to get planning permission to build in small rural villages. The factors getting in the way include tree zonings, green belts with a radius of three miles and designated sacred areas. I am at a loss to understand why permission is not granted for the building of an extra 20 or 30 houses in a proper, planned manner in any of the small villages and hamlets throughout the country. They could be served by a biocycle system that could be adapted to a larger sewerage system <Col N="1097" /> located elsewhere. This would address the housing problem and the pressure on urban centres.</P>
    <P>The inability to get planning permission is resulting in the downgrading of the fabric and social life of rural Ireland. Young people are moving to the cities and towns because rural areas are becoming socially defunct. Surely we can encourage and cajole, if necessary through legislation, the granting of planning permission in rural areas to ensure sustainability and stability. Week after week Members of the House receive representations from people in rural areas dealing with issues of decline, such as the loss of teachers, lack of use of post offices or the necessity to amalgamate football teams because the necessary 15 players cannot be found to sustain teams. Despite Government policies to encourage life in rural Ireland, planners are adamant that people should live in big towns and cities. That issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the national development plan. It reflects our current prosperity and signifies that we now have a modern economy. Some £4.6 billion will be spent on the road infrastructure, which I welcome. It will have a huge impact on economic and social life because it will open up the country. At present it takes approximately four and a half hours to drive from Cork to Dublin. It is a national disgrace that a national route can be blocked, as it is at Abbeyleix, where there is a half hour delay for commuting traffic on either side of the town. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will inject huge sums of money into the economy. Will the construction industry be able to deliver the targets set out in the plan on time? The National Roads Authority appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government yesterday. The delegation expressed confidence that the targets on the road infrastructure development it outlined to the committee would be met. However, if this is the case, it will be necessary to recruit outside contractors and consultants to assist the Irish companies because we do not have the required capacity. Large tenders will be made over the coming months and years as the plans are implemented, which will take labour from the construction industry. This will force up the cost of labour which will push up house prices. We must be aware of these factors and address them in time. We must also ensure that whatever assistance is necessary is provided to allow outside contractors and consultants assist their indigenous counterparts.</P>
    <P>The provisions on affordable housing are the most contentious in the Bill. We have all received representations from the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Home Builders Association and individuals who have expressed concern about them. I hope there will not be confrontation and that a consensus will emerge. At the end of the day we are trying, in the best interests of everybody, to address housing and ensure house prices do not increase further and that ordinary people have some hope of purchasing <Col N="1098" /> their own home. We must take on board their concerns so we do not have confrontations or appeals to courts which could hold up implementation of the Bill for another six months. The issue must be examined and there can be more consultation on Committee Stage if required. We must ensure that everybody is on board when the Bill is passed. Everybody is hoping the Bill will be successful.</P>
    <P>We cannot blame An Bord Pleanála for the delays in recent years as it was understaffed and under-resourced. However, more resources have been provided and extra members and inspectors have been appointed which is positive. The problem is that if local authorities do not receive extra resources to implement the legislative provisions in the Bill we will not make much progress.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to development charges. I have yet to get an answer from Cork County Council on how development charges are spent. Developers can be levied between £500 and £3,000 per house depending on the area while often a year or two later no footpaths have been provided, the road has not been resurfaced and no lights have been installed. People have paid for such work, but the council sends the money elsewhere and nobody knows where it goes. It seems to go into some form of central fund. There should be a register in which every development charge is available for public inspection, with a detailed outline of where the money is spent. Even though developers pay the levy, it is the purchaser of the house who eventually carries the can, and it is completely unacceptable that they get no value or perceive they get no value. If the system was transparent and open, with the details published showing where development charges went and whether they were spent, those who purchase homes would feel a degree of security.</P>
    <P>We must address the changes in society in terms of local authority and other housing. The make-up of families is changing from the traditional husband, wife and three or four children. Councils and developers, particularly in large urban areas, are building the same type of house &ndash; three or four bedrooms &ndash; or apartment in each area. In Cork, for example, the local authority may buy an estate or the health board may rent many apartments. Lone parents with one child are shepherded into apartment blocks. When some of these have a second or third child they might have to move across the city to a three bedroomed house. If there was a variation of house type in each location it would not be necessary for occupants to move from one community to another. Such moving does not allow for a cohesive build up of community. Every society likes to have a mix of young, middle aged and elderly people who gain and share experience. However, it is very difficult when there is no housing mix and such a set up encourages a breakdown in society, something which must be addressed in a very serious way. We must move away from building blocks of apartments of simi<Col N="1099" /> lar size and putting in them people who come from the same sector of society and who, if there is a change in family circumstances, must move to a different area and start again in a new community where they might know nobody.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again thank the Minister and hope he takes the points I have made on board. Overall the Bill is very positive and I hope it will impact on easing the housing situation.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Belton. I welcome the Planning and Development Bill which is very necessary and should be discussed as widely as possible. It includes some controversial and some very worthwhile provisions. The issue of planning has to be tackled as society has changed much over the past ten or 15 years, something not taken into account under existing legislation which was enacted some time before these changes.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers many issues and it would be remiss of me not to mention forestry development. All members of Leitrim County Council have contacted the Department of the Environment and Local Government on many occasions stating that all forestry development should be brought under the planning legislation. However, this has not been done. Currently 75 hectares of land can be planted with trees without the need to go through the planning process. I come from the most rural part of Ireland and we have had a major difficulty over the past number of years with people living in Leitrim feeling that afforestation is replacing people. A community cannot exist without people and the population in Leitrim is declining. One reason for this is the massive increase in afforestation in the county. The Minister should examine the inclusion of afforestation in the planning process. This is necessary as a proliferation of afforestation in an area results in the area being dead in terms of human inhabitants for a long time. I think afforestation is necessary, but it needs to be carried out in a planned way and not in the unplanned way in which it has been carried out over the past 30 or 40 years. This Bill provides us with an opportunity to put in place proper legislative measures dealing with afforestation in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing crisis is the main reason the Bill was brought before the House. Two or three weeks ago I attended a forum at which some interesting statistics were made available. Those aged between ten and 19 years make up the largest section of our population while those between 19 and 30 years, who are coming into the housing market, make up the next largest section. As most people in the latter category work and earn a decent wage, they want their own homes. The ten to 19 year olds will come into this category in the next few years. What was stated at the forum I attended is logical &ndash;  the number of houses built in the next 20 years will cater for our needs over the next 50 to 75 years. We must be careful about the way we plan but there is an urgency in that <Col N="1100" /> regard. If we do not build the necessary housing units for the people who will come on stream there will be a continuous housing crisis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the national development plan. Part of its economic strategy states that decentralisation is an important part of the Government's plan. If one looks at the proliferation of people on the east coast and parts of the west coast, where there is degradation due to the lack of people, it would not take a rocket scientist to work out that we need to move people from the east coast to the west coast to sustain communities.</P>
    <P>One must examine the concept of building new towns. If we had continued along those lines ten years ago, a number of individuals would have gone for the white coats and said, &ldquo;there is no need for that.&rdquo;  The Milton Keynes project in England some years ago was successful in moving people out of London city. Such projects involve the provision of proper infrastructure, health, education and social services. The national development plan deals with that in a small but not specific way. The decentralisation of Departments to other locations is important but if the infrastructural development is not put in place or, if there are no educational or health facilities, people will not want to move.</P>
    <P>The main reasons for people wanting to move out of Dublin are the large increases in house prices and traffic chaos. There must be an overall rather than piecemeal development plan or it will not work. The Government has failed to grasp that initiative. It is difficult to think in a radical manner, but we need radical proposals to deal with the issues which must be faced. The Government, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in particular, should consider those issues and undertake one decent decentralisation programme to a part of the country which needs people and development.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with strategic development zones where a streamlined planning process will operate in specific sites selected by the Government. This is crucial for the development of the country in general, but if we create strategic development zones in urban areas where planning processes will be dealt with in a more streamlined and efficient manner, it will still mean masses of people will converge in certain areas and rural areas will be left behind. The county I represent has a low population and is a major rural base, but if it does not form part of the strategic development zone it will not develop. Development must take place in areas where it is needed. The Government will have to consider this in a critical and fair minded fashion and think of radical ways to develop strategic development zones where they are needed.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Michael Smith, when Minister for the Environment, who abolished funding for infrastructural development in small towns and villages but, thankfully, it has been reintroduced. It is difficult to develop small towns and villages if the sewerage and water schemes <Col N="1101" /> are not in place. I hope, therefore, more money will be provided for the development of small towns. Many people would move from large conurbations to small towns or villages if they had the proper facilities. This is not happening and development land is not coming on stream in those areas because of the lack of development of small schemes. Developers, rather than the State, are being asked to provide sewerage and water services; they should go hand in hand. People can apply to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for grant aid for sewerage schemes but, while that is a good idea, it has not been adequately promoted by the local authorities. It would be interesting to find out the number of those schemes which have been taken up. From my experience they have not been taken up in the Sligo-Leitrim area. The Department of the Environment and Local Government should provide incentives in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane pointed out that the number of local authority houses being built is small compared to what was built ten or 15 years ago. A person should be allowed sell a landbank to a local authority without incurring capital gains tax. The 20% capital gains on development land should be abolished in the case of local authority purchases. More land would then become available which could be used to provide more social housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, but I have some concerns about it. Planning is an important area, but many people are concerned about some of the Bill's proposals. People directly involved in the social housing process have voiced their concerns about planning officers having to negotiate with developers without the specifics being spelled out. The Government has opted out of constructive responsibility for providing public housing. When there were no resources and there were budgetary restrictions, all Governments &ndash; even my party who were always to the fore in providing public housing &ndash; failed to provide public housing, but this Government has failed miserably in that regard. The Government has failed to provide housing to those on local authority waiting lists. Hospital and housing waiting lists are a feature of this State. When people refer to the Celtic tiger, they should keep one eye on the waiting lists for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning has become the biggest issue in Ireland. The structure and personnel are not in place to deal with the explosion in planning applications. The numbers needed to meet the demand of the planning process are not available. It is fine for the Minister to say extra people should be employed but local authorities point out that they do not have the resources to recruit them. Approximately 25 planning officers qualify annually but that does not even come close to meeting the requirement of local authorities, which find it almost impossible to recruit planning officers. All of us are aware of how vital it is for local auth<Col N="1102" /> orities to have personnel to administer planning applications.</P>
    <P>Before an application is submitted, there should be an opportunity for consultation. Previous speakers said that some local authorities will do this but others will not. This is the kernel of the problem because there should be consultation in all cases before a planning application is submitted. An Bord Pleanála's appeals process involves an oral hearing. Why not have a similar hearing prior to the submission of a planning application? The system is clogged up by planning applications which are returned for further information. If the Minister and the Department are serious, a consultation prior to submission must be provided and it should be part of the planning process.</P>
    <P>I was a member of Longford County Council for 20 years. The council devised a programme which provides housing in small villages and towns. I compliment the council's staff on having the foresight to provide such housing. It gives an opportunity to people, especially the elderly, to live in a community with a good infrastructure, including shops, churches, etc.. Many of the elderly people lived on their own in isolated areas and were given an opportunity to integrate into larger communities. It is important that such people have neighbours who will check on them regularly. This was good planning by the local authority.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, many people are anxious to live in rural areas. They are under extreme pressure as they attempt to obtain planning permission. I understand why local authorities are concerned about such applications because if, for example, there was a problem with sewage down the line, the local authority could be held accountable. However, as previous speakers said, with the advent of modern technology treatment plants should not create as big a problem as they did in the past. The same situation pertains in all local authority areas. There seems to be a mental block when it comes to granting planning permission in rural areas. I ask the Minister to face up to that reality and encourage more people to live in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no more emotive subject in the context of local authority dealings than the planning process and if a survey were carried out it would establish that most disputes in council chambers and accusations of corruption in the local authority system could be traced to planning. There is no doubt that at this stage in our development we cannot do without the controls provided in the planning process, the discipline it imposes on our society and the assistance it gives towards proper regulation of the development of the landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proper planning process in needed. The better it is, the more relevant it will be to people's needs and the better it serves our society, the more acceptable it will be. I hope and believe this legislation will improve the process. The shortcomings in its provisions are relatively minor in <Col N="1103" /> the overall context. Some local authorities implemented the planning Acts without any degree of flexibility or common sense and one would be forgiven for thinking landowners, potential house builders and young couples in need of housing were there to serve the Acts rather than the other way round. Very often the planning system is not helped by the fact that planning officers are just passing through a particular county where they remain for a few years before they are appointed to a post closer to home or a more senior position.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, there has always been some degree of dissatisfaction, not just among the public, with the planning process. That was inevitable when many applications impinged on the rights of individuals, such as their right to build a house in a location of their choice, their right to sell a site and earn a profit or their right to object to an application which they perceived would be detrimental to their quality of life.</P>
    <P>Those who administer the planning system have not always been sympathetic to the needs or rights of individuals, the requirements of certain areas or the history and fabric of towns, villages and the countryside. Shortcomings can be found in any system but there is a clear perception among people that the planning Acts are in existence to burden them, impose unnecessary constraints and protect a third party, especially one which is involved in commercial development. There appears to be a lack of consistency in decision making by planning authorities with applications for some developments receiving approval where it is apparent to even the least formally qualified individual that it will offer little to the existing community.</P>
    <P>The planning authorities in my constituency operate well balanced and reasonable planning regimes but that was not always the case. There was a great deal of dissatisfaction among the public there as a result of two harsh decisions. As we improve and modernise the planning code, the time for tackling these problems is now. We can prevent difficulties increasing or even emerging in the future through adequate legislation, firm guidelines and clear policies. For example, the population of a rural village outside County Waterford trebled within a short period following the granting of planning permission for 1,000 new houses in 400 and 500 unit lots. The quality of life of those inhabitants who live in a quiet rural setting, and who could reasonably have expected to continue in that mode, has been stolen from them, with little provision for improved services. They have water only at certain hours of the day, traffic is chaotic and in one location there is a bridge on which two vehicles cannot pass. That was fine when it was a sleepy village, but those days are long gone.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand that kind of decision considering that planners now have sociological <Col N="1104" /> rather than technical qualifications. Decisions like this bring the whole system into disrepute and it can truthfully be claimed that the planning system in some areas has lost the respect of the public. That is not all the planners' fault, but we must address the problem urgently and redress it where possible. I exhort the Minister to examine the training of planners to see where it can be improved and to make it more relevant to today's society.</P>
    <P>There has to be a greater accent on the technical side of their function rather than just looking at the social side. I would like to see more emphasis on architecture, engineering and physical and landscape planning with a practical hands-on philosophy. What we need is people who can plan properly, who are sensitive to the needs of others and who are firmly focused on the broader picture of making life more acceptable for people.</P>
    <P>Too often the emphasis in planning can be personal to the planner involved with what could almost be personal prejudice or the likes or dislikes coming through. It is well known that some planners do not like brick or other materials whereas others can have a fascination for, say, vertical emphasis windows. One man involved in the planning process told me recently that he would defy me or anyone else to read the development plan for a particular area and find where the planners had dreamed up a future for that area. There is not often an overall vision of where the town or village is going, or where it should develop. The training emphasis should be on the wider picture, a broad vision for those whom they serve.</P>
    <P>The county plan is too often couched in negative language, where the accent is on &ldquo;Thou shalt not do this or that&rdquo; rather than pointing out areas that should be developed in a particular way, or making positive suggestions about what should happen rather than what should not. I know of one county where a planner sets aside one morning a month to see members of the public, and there are other offices where time for the public is at a premium. This is hardly a satisfactory state of affairs and I implore the Minister to review staffing levels in the various planning offices. It stands to reason that with the huge upsurge in development, there has to be a massively increased workload requiring a commensurate increase in staff.</P>
    <P>It may not be an exaggeration to say there is a lack of respect among the public for the planning system and a lack of sympathy for the practical difficulties of the applicant. Too often the planning system is seen as a vehicle by which people can lodge trivial objections for unrealistic personal reasons while planning applications for hundreds of houses or undesirable developments can be foisted on the public against all apparent logic. The planning system is not seen as a tool to assist society and it has become somewhat discredited in the eyes of the public. Any change this new legislation can bring would be welcome. Against that background I would like to see con<Col N="1105" /> sistency emerge countrywide, a greater preparation for planners, more staff to deal with a doubling or trebling of applications and where the number of units per application has greatly increased also.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the matter of planning application fees, particularly in the commercial sector. The application of a fee per square metre is hardly equitable, realistic or even necessary unless the sole purpose, and this is often the case, is to raise revenue for the planning authority. Doubling the fee where a fire safety certificate is involved amounts to a considerable sum. The small industrialist who applies for planning permission for a modest new factory of, say, 1,000 square metres will, under the current system, pay double the fee for a 500 square metre unit. There may be little or no difference in the amount of administration necessary, the length of time staff have to deal with the application or the amount of documentation generated. We need to make the system as easy as possible for those who could expand our economy and who may be starting out in business or manufacturing. There is no problem for the big corporation but for the person starting up in business it may be, and often has been, the difference between persevering with the application or giving up in frustration.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with that, and while I am on the subject of money, I ask the Minister to re-examine his proposal to introduce a fee in respect of an objection to a particular application. I know he has given an undertaking to keep the fee under £20 but even that amount of money for an impoverished person or an old age pensioner is significant. In such cases and for such people, the Minister should consider waiving the fee. It would hardly have a major financial impact and would have the effect of keeping a necessary right within the reach of everyone in our society, a principle I know the Minister espouses.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's intention in bringing in this provision and agree that the process of objecting to a development should not be a trivial one. There are too many crank objections and objections for narrow reasons. The long-running saga in the Glen of the Downs, for instance, is a case in point. When an objection has run its course and has been tested in the courts, it is time to retreat gracefully and obey the institutions of the State. That is not how it works in the Glen of the Downs. What has been found to be a fully legitimate plan to make a dangerous road safe has been unnecessarily delayed by people who do not know when to stop and who do not appear to have respect for the law. I admire people who stand on principle and I admire action by the public but there is a limit and we are long past this limit in the Wicklow case.</P>
    <P>Another area of contention which has been provided for in this legislation is the vexed question of halting sites. In common with the vast majority of people here, I have always sympathised with the plight of the members of the traveller community who are caught in the pov<Col N="1106" /> erty trap or whose traditions and customs keep them locked in what we perceive to be a lesser lifestyle to what the rest of the country enjoys. I support the principle of giving those families whatever help is necessary. I support the provision of halting sites in proper locations and I have no difficulty in spending more money <i>per capita</i> on traveller families than on the rest of the country. I would point out, however, to those members of the travelling community who have caused problems in the past, that with the right to special treatment goes the responsibility to learn to respect other people and property. I have seen wanton vandalism in my own constituency and the destruction of halting sites with a consequent burden on taxpayers. In some cases, the kind of damage that was done was almost unimaginable and lack of education or resources could not justify that.</P>
    <P>Difficulties occur in the settled community as well and there are some well known neighbours from hell among us. These can be identified and can be put out of their local authority houses for failure to act properly. I wonder if a provision could be brought in to have them denied planning permission for a house based on their previous known bad record if they decide to join the private sector. That will effectively focus their minds on how they are less than perfect in their communities.</P>
    <P>I note section 44 enables the planning authority to acquire land for the purpose of providing a green area where it has not been provided by the developer. I welcome that decision but would make the point that in some areas a regrettable situation has developed whereby the open space in a housing estate has been given to or taken in charge by the local residents' association, something which is desirable and commendable in most cases. The residents sometimes become over protective of that open space and instead of having an active playground for children it is turned into the parlour of the estate which is immaculately groomed and deemed too good for games. This defeats the whole purpose of the exercise and I ask residents' associations to consider again the reason there is a necessity for open space. </P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the position of An Bord Pleanála. The Minister proposes to increase the number of members on the board to seven. While I am not suggesting any deliberate impropriety on the part of the board, I am opposed to the principle of the final decision makers being unelected officials and board nominees. As with the planners, the level of professional or technical expertise among the members of the board is not required to be extensive so I am not convinced that there was a valid reason for removing the appeals process from the political domain. Consequently, I believe we are not operating the best system.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at retaining the ultimate decision making power among elected representatives. As in so many other facets of the public sector, democracy is best served by those who must go before the people and justify their <Col N="1107" /> decisions at election time. They must take the ultimate test of the propriety of their actions &ndash; the ballot box. I am aware of more than one instance of an inspector's decision, based on local investigation, being overturned by the board. While the board has that right, I do not believe it is necessarily proper. This power should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which An Bord Pleanála works are more advantageous than those of the local authority. The board has 18 weeks to decide on an application, with the option of a deferral, whereas the local authority must decide within two months. Eighteen weeks is generous from the board's point of view given that most of the investigation has been carried out by the local authority and the board often has little more to do than review the case.</P>
    <P>It is time to look realistically at the repopulation of rural areas. These are demanding times and it is already difficult for many people to remain in rural areas. Farmers are fleeing the land in their thousands, searching for better and more stable lives and incomes in urban areas. During the recent meat factory dispute we saw how difficult it is for beef farmers to make ends meet. We must not alone encourage people but actively enable them to build homes in the country, set down roots and make a life there. Easing the planning process is one way of doing that. If we are to pay more than lip service to that principle we should start encouraging people to move to or to remain in the country.</P>
    <P>Section 43 replaces section 30 of the existing legislation and proposes to limit the powers of elected members to change or revoke a planning permission. This is another intrusion into and a diminution of the power of elected representatives and I am not in favour of it. Part V deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with housing supply. It includes many good proposals. I welcome the provision under which development land must be given to the local authority. This will reduce the possibility of creating ghettos and achieve a better spread of people of different economic means. I am less than clear on the manner in which the proposed 80:20 allocation of development land will work. Perhaps the Minister will clarify what is involved. I wish to sound a note of caution with regard to public land versus private sites. This is fraught with many difficulties and dangers but I prefer to be more knowledgeable about what is proposed before discussing it further.</P>
    <P>The provision of one bedroom homes should be abandoned. I have had a bee in my bonnet about this matter for some time. Given people's mobility, no person will not have to cater for visitors, even visitors of advanced years. One bedroom is a limiting factor and the provision of one bedroom houses should be abandoned, speedily and gracefully. Unfortunately, however, some local authorities are still building them.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation it will be a requirement that contract work be given to the lowest tender. <Col N="1108" /> While this might seem prudent financially and fair in practice, it will not guarantee value for money for the taxpayers. It has been our experience in the past that the lowest tender might be submitted by an unreliable contractor. This causes subsequent difficulties, necessitating rescue missions or calling in another contractor to finish the job. There should be a degree of flexibility in the tendering process to get the best value for money rather than simply effecting what will ultimately be a false economy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. While it has minor flaws, it is an honest attempt on the part of the Minister and his officials to reform the planning process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill is crucial for the development of the country and will determine how Ireland will look in ten years and beyond. The Bill aims to improve the planning system so the objectives of the national development plan can proceed in the timescale envisaged. The massive building work and infrastructural development that must happen in the next seven years cannot proceed without significant improvements of the planning system.</P>
      <P>Many of the aspirations of the Bill are necessary and welcome, primarily the objective of streamlining the planning system to reduce delays and speed up the planning process. Infrastructural development in Ireland has not kept pace with the overall rate of growth, particularly over the past five years. As a result it has also been unable to keep pace with the dramatic social changes prosperity has brought to the country. Social infrastructure consists of schools, libraries, hospitals, sports facilities and other such amenities. Economic infrastructure relates mainly to transportation &ndash; roads, motorways, rail networks, public transport facilities and so forth.</P>
      <P>In the last decade there has been a deficit in infrastructural development which, unless reversed, will have a negative impact on our economy. It will affect our competitiveness by causing labour shortages, because people will be unable to travel to work due to time delays, and discourage foreign investment, because our road network will not be seen as up to the standard of the rest of Europe. These are crucial factors in ensuring our continued prosperity and they cannot be addressed without an adequate planning system.</P>
      <P>Lack of infrastructural development also has an impact on our social lives by restricting choices with regard to workplaces, education, recreation, commuting and the location of our homes. As a result, although personal incomes have increased, public wealth and the quality of life have not improved with prosperity. Three sectors will receive massive investment over the duration of the national development plan and these sectors are the key to the success of the Planning and Development Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first sector is the road network. With national roads being allocated £4.7 billion and <Col N="1109" /> non-national roads £1.6 billion over the next ten years, there will be serious problems with and objections to the development of these roads. It is planned to build 50,000 houses every year for the next seven years and approximately £6 billion has been earmarked for social housing. The implications of this building programme for planning are enormous and it cannot happen unless there is an improved planning system which, to be fair, this Bill attempts to provide. The third sector is the rail network, the provision of new rail lines and the improvement of existing lines.</P>
    <P>These proposals rely heavily on the Planning and Development Bill to ensure the developments happen in the suggested timescale and in a manner that is socially, environmentally and economically acceptable. There will be massive pressure on the planning system over the next decade. That is why it is important this Bill receives the time and attention it merits from Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with specific provisions in the Bill, I wish to highlight a huge mistake in the national development plan, primarily in the areas of housing and infrastructure, which impacts strongly on the Bill. The absence of a national spatial development strategy is a huge mistake. It will result in increased pressure on local planning offices throughout the country and a lack of national direction in development. How can there be a plan for 50,000 new housing starts every year with no clear plan as to where this development should happen? The Minister of State will know what I mean when I say that 50,000 houses is equivalent to a city the size of Cork being erected every year for the next seven years. This scale of development needs extensive planning and direction at national and local level, but primarily at national level. In the past we have seen a number of examples where inadequate planning in urban, built-up areas has been as much a culprit in contributing to the creation of inner city disadvantaged areas as the income poverty of those who inhabit these areas. That is why it is essential we learn from our mistakes and give co-ordinated guidance at national level and significant resources to planning authorities throughout the country in areas we know will undergo extensive development.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has announced that a national spatial strategy will be put in place as part of the national development plan and I accept that. However, the terms of reference for this spatial strategy have yet to be decided, unless the Minister can enlighten me otherwise, so we do not know how comprehensive it will be. It appears that we will not see this strategy until 2002, almost one-third through the lifetime of the plan, when over 100,000 houses will have been built and many of the infrastructural developments will have commenced and be well under way. If ever there was a case of backward planning by the Government, this is it. A spatial strategy should have decided <Col N="1110" /> the priorities for the Bill and also for the national development plan, ensuring co-ordination and consistency between projects instead of being the afterthought it is.</P>
    <P>What we needed before the introduction of the Bill and the announcement of the national development plan was a spatial plan which, in basic terms, comprised a map of Ireland outlining clearly where, in the view of the Government, the following provisions should be made. Housing is the first and most important area, which would include new towns and cities or nodes of development. I was encouraged to hear a previous speaker talk of the importance of developing rural areas. Despite all the talk of many rural people moving to city areas, 40% of the population still live in what I would classify as rural towns and villages and rural areas. We need to try to revitalise that and, through a national spatial study, ensure that the majority of development happens in towns which need an influx of population and wealth and which can provide a community base for people who want to set up a new home, something the outskirts of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway cannot do without contributing to urban sprawl.</P>
    <P>The second area which should have been outlined was recreational and sporting facilities integrated with housing. The previous speaker referred to green areas which need to be provided with developments. However, there is no point providing a green area which in many cases is surrounded by a road and, in certain circumstances as has been pointed out, is kept to perfection so that children are not even allowed to kick a football on it. That is not providing recreational space. Green area there does not translate to an area used in a beneficial way by a community living there, and that is an area the Bill must examine in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Areas where well designed, high density housing should predominate should be highlighted in a national spatial study. They should primarily be near enhanced transport links. It is an area which is dealt with to some extent in the Bacon report but is not enforced in the Bill. We also need to plan where we will locate new motorways, enhanced rail links and waste disposal facilities, which may make local planning decisions somewhat easier if they are given guidance and a suggestion about how an overall plan should work.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal primarily with Part V which relates to housing supply for the years ahead. It is an area on which I have focused so far. The Minister does not need me to tell him that the housing problem is huge. A number of challenges must be met by the Bill: first is the issue of demand outstripping supply and, therefore, driving up the price of houses and development land; second is trying to supply sufficient social housing to those who cannot afford to purchase or build homes for themselves and third is the issue of integrating social housing with private housing so <Col N="1111" /> that mistakes of the past which resulted in serious social implications do not happen again.</P>
    <P>It has been generally commented that Part V does nothing to increase the overall supply of private housing. Some suggest that it may reduce the supply of private housing by 10% to 20% if developers are forced into supplying social housing as part of their overall private developments. The question of how we integrate social housing with private housing is a difficult one to answer. One thing is certain; we must provide between 10,000 and 15,000 new housing starts every year to make an impact on our housing lists. The assessment of housing needs in 1999 recorded 39,000 households compared with 26,000 households in 1996 seeking social housing. This is a frightening statistic and there are many reasons for it. For many people, the reason is genuine poverty. Many have an income of less than £10,000, which means they are not even close to being able to afford or partially afford their own home. Another reason is the unaffordability of houses for middle and low income earners. These are people who do not want the assistance of the State but are forced to join housing lists because of housing prices.</P>
    <P>The Government's original proposal in section 82 which enabled housing or planning authorities in specific applications for permission to build housing on land zoned residential to require the developer to transfer to the housing authority a portion of the land not greater than 20% or a specific percentage for social housing in the county development plan was and is a flaw in the Bill. I understand the Minister has introduced a correction measure to try to water down the requirement on developers to provide and sell social housing for an affordable price. Like the previous speaker, I would like the Minister to clarify exactly what is the position at this stage. The implications of this are that it will increase the price of the non-social aspect of developments so that private house buyers will suffer the cost of the measure. That is unacceptable because it is recreating the vicious circle. One of the reasons so many people are on local authority housing waiting lists is that people cannot afford to buy their own houses.</P>
    <P>Under the original measure, the compensation paid to developers for the land transferred to the planning authority was the value of the land in its use before it was zoned, which in some cases is the agricultural price. I understand this has now been changed and I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify that for me. This is a part of the Bill which has caused many land owners and developers to delay developing land in the hope that this aspect of the Bill will be changed. As a result, the supply of houses is being slowed down and land zoned for residential use in certain areas is not being developed. This is increasing demand and reducing supply which is the essence of the housing problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> If developers are to build social housing as part of their development, the Minister must ensure these houses are mixed well within the overall plan of the estate. If 80 houses in a development of 100 houses are built to a high specification and the remaining 20 houses fulfil the builder's social housing planning requirement, the last thing I want to see is the social housing placed in a corner of the development. The point of requiring the developer to build social housing is to ensure a mix, and yet that will not happen in the development if the social housing is pushed into one corner. There is a frightening development in urban areas whereby there are private housing developments surrounded by walls, which are topped with barred wire in many cases, and big gates, and outside there is social housing. That is the last thing we want to see happening. If private developers are to be required to build social housing or sell land to local authorities, then that must be intermingled with the private housing development. There must not be a huge gap between the private houses and the social houses. Otherwise the policy of integration will fail.</P>
    <P>The Bill should include a provision to promote in every possible way the shared ownership scheme for people who are on the housing list. There is a huge difference between a person who owns part of his or her house and a person who is renting. That difference is evident in the way the person looks after that premises. If a person has a sense of responsibility and ownership of a house, he or she will look after it much better than if he or she is renting and only there for a time. For example, the cost of maintenance of social housing incurred by Cork County Council last year was greater than the cost of building new housing units there. That speaks volumes about the way people value their houses when they are renting. The Government must ensure that we maximise the number of people who feel they have a share in the ownership of their houses to ensure they look after the houses as well as possible.</P>
    <P>If the Government expects many of the provisions in the Bill to work, it will need to allocate significant resources to planning authorities so that target planning application times can be met. I am a member of the local authority and last year 7,000 planning applications passed through County Hall, Cork. The planning authorities just cannot cope. There is a need for more staff and office space. There is a need to decentralise planning offices as much as possible so that people will not need to travel long distances from west Cork, for example, to the planning office in the city to inquire about a decision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill. It is a move in the right direction in that the Minister wants to streamline planning and improve the system, but a national spatial study should be undertaken and a plan should be put in place as soon as possible in order that the national development plan and the Bill will have a more <Col N="1113" /> focused direction, and that we all realise the challenges ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last election campaign, the Green Party promised a more people friendly and community friendly planning system which would ensure greater transparency, efficiency and public participation. Fianna Fáil promised it would put people before politics but this Bill achieves the opposite. The politics of development and developer take precedence over the participation of ordinary people, and who better to represent developers than the party of developers, Fianna Fáil?</P>
      <P>The aim or mission statement of the Bill is essentially to speed up the process but it has been cleverly put forward as a Bill to improve the planning process. It is in a sense reminiscent of the introduction of the EPA Bill which was seen at the time as a great step forward for environmental protection, but the real agenda was to stop all those annoying environmentalists from objecting to industry in places like Cork harbour, and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said as much. Therefore, there was this false dichotomy between planning and legitimate environmental concerns, and I welcome the fact that the Bill addresses this problem to some extent. However, as a result of that dichotomy, in the minds of many people the EPA became an industrial licensing authority. What is needed is a better resourced environmental protection agency with greater powers.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear that the Bill is not about protecting the environment or sustainability but about protecting vested interests. Now we learn that the Minister intends to amend the Bill to enable the fast tracking of road projects which will form part of the national development plan. The national development plan is a blueprint for unsustainability. It will result in more destruction of habitat and countryside and huge increases in carbon dioxide emissions. There is a clear imbalance between investment in roads and public transport. Why will the Minister not fast track the development of public transport, eco villages or, indeed, housing provisions or wind farm projects, particularly those off-shore which are inherently ecologically sustainable and yet have been ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there are many environmentalists, led by the Deputy's party, opposing wind farms also, as the Deputy will be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not off-shore developments. In the case of the Glen of the Downs a lesson has been learned and they feel they must get rid of these &ldquo;pesky&rdquo; environmentalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address a problem, to which no other speaker referred, that is tree preservation orders. The Department must adopt a completely different approach to this. There are only two tree preservation orders in Dublin. The <Col N="1114" /> system does not work. I would ask the Minister to look at a different approach entirely whereby trees are protected and one must apply for a tree felling licence. That would allow for greater sustainability. I hope the Minister will look at that but unfortunately he may just ignore that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Bill means that members of the public who wish to object to a planning application must pay a fee. Residents associations, community groups and concerned individuals find it difficult enough already when they attempt to challenge developers who have no difficulty when it comes to resources. The proposal of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, serves to create an even more inequitable system. If anything, the Bill should provide resources for groups who challenge these developers. I have received complaints from my own constituents and if I am getting complaints from people in Rathgar and Ballsbridge, one can imagine what it is like for those people in Ringsend who are trying to challenge developers who have vast budgets and can hire the best barristers for an oral hearing. The fee, to which I refer, is totally undemocratic and erodes people's confidence in the planning system.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that an objection must be lodged before an appeal can be heard. We know planning conditions can be attached and that the very nature of an appeal can be changed, so why are we including this provision? It is ridiculous. If people are being asked to pay more money, what are they getting in return? Are they getting greater efficiency, more transparency, more planners and a better all round service? The answer, I am afraid, is no. The Bill will not provide that.</P>
    <P>A small concession could have been made in relation to notification. Why, for example, does this Bill not make it mandatory on local authorities to have applications on the world wide web? This is, after all, the digital age. This Bill is to set the terms for planning in the 21st century and yet we are still talking about notification in the newspaper or on the site. Site notices can be missed. Look at what happened recently in Sandymount where the Presbyterian church, a beautiful landmark, was destroyed. This site notice was placed on the front gate, as required, but the gate was always open so one could not see it. Few people, if any, saw it.</P>
    <P>An Taisce has made another proposal, that is, to make site notices more visible and that one has a type of photomontage. If I tried to imagine a photomontage for Sandymount church, it would feature a beautiful church and then a picture of a bulldozer beside it so we could see exactly what was going to happen. That would explain in graphic detail to the public what they would get.</P>
    <P>If planning applications appeared on the Internet with the full address, finding an application would be much easier for residents associations. By simply typing in Dublin 4, Rathgar or Rathmines, all those applications would come up. Relevant documents could be posted on the net, such as further information. This is the way things <Col N="1115" /> should be done. A modern planning process should embrace new technologies but this Bill simply ignores them. If the Minister has the political will, this could be changed on Committee Stage; it is a small concession.</P>
    <P>Sustainability can be helped by technology. This Bill recognises &ndash; I welcome it to that extent &ndash; that the all important standard for planning permission will be changed from proper planning and development to proper planning and sustainable development. The problem here is that there is no definition of sustainability. We could take the Brundland definition of sustainability and perhaps it could be inserted in the Bill. It could, however, be simplified as development which improves the quality of life for present and future generations. It should mean the real eco auditing of various projects, something the Government promised to do before coming into office. Above all else, it would entail a new measurement of progress in society. GDP is a very crude measurement done on a calculator without a minus sign. This Bill would have more meaning if it were placed within the context of an overall sustainability strategy or, as was said by the previous speaker, a national spatial strategy. If that does not happen, Kilkenny, parts of Louth and even as far as Dundalk will become part of the greater Dublin area. I travelled to Skerries the other night and there is no difference anymore &ndash; no green space. We will get that continued sprawl because there is no strategy.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more unsustainable than unauthorised development. It makes a mockery of our planning process and adds to the frustration of residents' groups. I welcome the fact this Bill provides for the mandatory enforcement of planning law. Some of my constituents in Ballsbridge live beside Mount Herbert Hotel and have found it impossible to get Dublin Corporation to enforce planning conditions. I hope this Bill will improve the situation.</P>
    <P>However, the practice of retention of use should be stopped. This worst example of this occurred in my constituency where a company, Bio-burn, built an incinerator without planning permission. I eventually got the corporation to deal with this matter but it was very difficult. I saw the affidavits in court which showed that dioxin levels from this incinerator were hundreds of times the acceptable level. When I revealed this, I was brought to the High Court for contempt of court. I became aware of the imbalance of power in the planning process. Enforcement officers will say there is little point bringing such matters to court as one will inevitability suffer costs and will always lose. How many unauthorised developments have been bulldozed, as happens in the UK, for example? A case could have been made 40 years ago under the 1963 Act that retention of use was permissible, but that is no longer the case. We have to re-examine that concept.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the definition of &ldquo;exempted development&rdquo;. This will now include <Col N="1116" /> development carried out on behalf of, or in partnership with, the local authority. Will this mean private/public partnerships will come under the scope of this provision? Will the proposed eastern bypass which will dig up Sandymount Strand not require proper planning permission? Will the proposed incinerator in Ringsend not require normal planning permission? We have already seen the Minister's attitude towards the potential problems.</P>
    <P>When I spoke at a meeting about incineration in Ringsend at the beginning of December last year I explained that the Minister had a crucial role to play in this development as he had to authorise the environmental impact assessment. I undertook to put the Minister under pressure in this House but, lo and behold, on 23 December, he introduced S.I. 431 of 1999 transferring this power to the EPA, which was very convenient. I support the amendment put forward by An Taisce on exempted development in section 4.</P>
    <P>On environmental impact assessments in general, we should recognise that environmental consultants are, in effect, hired guns and that there is a greater need for independence. The Minister may be aware of the story told by Professor Paul Connett about the difference between a mathematician, a philosopher and an environmental consultant. If one asks the mathematician what one and one is, he will say two; if one asks the philosopher, he will say it depends what one means by one and if one asks the environmental consultant he will say shut the door and tell him what one wants it to be. That is the situation we face here.</P>
    <P>We need an updated EPA with more resources and more clout. If that was the case, perhaps it could carry out the EIS paid for by the developer. That is the way we should go otherwise self-regulation is part of the planning process from the beginning. Indeed, the Minister's strategy is based on fast tracking, self-regulation and end of pipe solutions, all of which will perhaps endear him to industry and developers but which will have disastrous consequences for the environment far into the future. Independence is vital if we are to retain the confidence of the public in the planning system.</P>
    <P>The way An Bord Pleanála operates must be examined. The manner in which people are appointed must be transparent and accountable. I agree with other speakers that the Bill should provide for a statement of reasons where the board departs from the inspector's report.</P>
    <P>The Bill also seeks to deal with the housing problem. This Government has recognised at long last that we have a housing crisis. All of us, as public representatives, deal with many people who are in a desperate situation. It is seldom said that the artificially low interest rates are leading to considerable speculation. Houses in my area have gone from £50,000 to about £150,000 in seven years. Like other Deputies, I believe that what the Minister is trying to do will happen too slowly. We have already seen in the Dublin dock<Col N="1117" /> lands area that the 20% provision has not worked. Not one developer has come on board. They will resist this with all their might and will challenge it.</P>
    <P>Another way of tackling this would have been the concept of an annual development land tax. Various forms of annual land taxes have brought social and economic sustainability all over the world and could do so in Ireland as well. A land tax is not to be confused with rates, which increase with improvements in property and partly taxes enterprise and investment. Land taxes apply only to the land a building occupies or may occupy and is, therefore, a green tax encouraging efficient use of a vital natural resource.</P>
    <P>The annual development land tax concept I propose is more limited and applies only to undeveloped green and brown field sites, the value of which have increased without any input from the owner. The Green Party believes that replacing some income and capital taxes with an annual tax levied on development land is the most efficient and equitable method of ensuring affordable and sustainable housing development in the Irish context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 4, 106, 111, 112, 118, 119 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make three very important points. Any suggestion that the Defence Forces were not adequately consulted is without foundation. The White Paper on Defence provides for the most significant development of the Defence Forces ever undertaken. It sets out a general framework for an unprecedented additional investment initiative totalling £300 million over the next decade which will transform the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation. It proposes a <Col N="1119" /> very modest reduction in PDF strength which is necessary to develop an affordable, sustainable, world class military organisation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have another opportunity to make it absolutely clear that any suggestion that the Defence Forces were not adequately consulted is without foundation. On the contrary, the entire thrust of the White Paper is based on the Government's acceptance of the requirement for a major programme of capital investment put forward by the military authorities as their No. 1 priority. They have stressed this on a number of occasions. Although certain elements may claim there has been insufficient consultation, the reality is that consultation does not necessarily lead to full agreement. In essence, the fundamental principle is that decisions on the allocation of national resources are a matter for Government alone, not for the deliverers of any services provided by the State.</P>
    <P>Since work on the White Paper commenced, I have emphasised the importance of the consultative element of the process. I was acutely aware that a topic of such fundamental importance as defence should be the subject of widespread consultation. To this end I directed that all of the key stakeholders, including the Departments of the Taoiseach, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance and Foreign Affairs as well as the military authorities, be given the opportunity to make their input to the White Paper. I also placed a notice in the national newspapers inviting submissions from members of the public. At the same time, I was very conscious of the need for balance to be maintained between consultation on the one hand and my duty as Minister in relation to the formation of defence policy on the other.</P>
    <P>As soon as initial draft chapters were available, these were passed to the military authorities. Similarly, as soon as a full White Paper draft was available this was also passed to the military. The military authorities were invited to respond to each of these drafts, which were subsequently amended substantially following consideration of this feedback. Throughout the process every effort was made to accommodate the military views.</P>
    <P>There is no foundation to the suggestion that civil servants alone drew up this White Paper without my input. My name is on every chapter. These are the same officials who supported me in my efforts to contain the avalanche of hearing impairment claims, which had the potential to put an end to any hopes of a reinvestment programme for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the Chief of Staff's recent visit with members of the Defence Forces, including the Army Ranger Wing serving with the International Force in East Timor. It is incorrect to claim that his visit to East Timor was cut short. The Chief of Staff's work in East Timor was completed. The decision not to proceed with the Australian component of his trip was his. Following his return, further discussions took place between <Col N="1120" /> senior civil and military management on the draft White Paper. The process of consultation is continuing and the military have been invited to provide further inputs prior to the submission of a final draft for the Government's consideration. I trust it is abundantly clear from what I have said that the claim that the Defence Forces were not given a sufficient input into the White Paper is based on a fundamentally mistaken view of the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>Far from being excluded from the process, the White Paper represents a response by Government to a sustained case advanced by the Defence Forces for re-equipment. This case has been advanced to me, to the Taoiseach and to officials of my Department. The case for re-equipment is overwhelming and it has been accepted. However, the determination of national priorities in resource allocation is a matter exclusively for Government.</P>
    <P>Government does not want a larger, under-equipped force, regardless of its appeal in certain quarters. The purpose of the White Paper is to specify Government's requirements; a more capable organisation with better equipment, enhanced training and regular recruitment.</P>
    <P>All of the funds released will be available for re-equipping programmes in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. It has been made clear that the Defence Forces will be provided with further additional funds for any extension of the ministerial air transport service and for the new Naval vessel.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence provides for the most significant development of the Defence Forces ever undertaken. The Government is committed to developing the Defence Forces into a world class military organisation and the White Paper sets out a general framework for an unprecedented investment drive.</P>
    <P>The foundations for this process are already in place. The allocation of pay savings from the first phase reorganisation have facilitated, for example, the financing of the purchase of new armoured personnel carriers at a cost of £40 million. However, to build a world class military organisation, much more is needed. For many years, military personnel have sought a greater investment in equipment. Under the draft White Paper proposals, this requirements will be met.</P>
    <P>The White Paper will include the following key measures: the first ever ten year programme which will see an additional £300 million invested in new equipment and infrastructure; new aircraft for the Air Corps as a matter of urgency; a second new ship for the Naval Service and the maintenance of a modern eight ship flotilla; the provision of continuous recruitment and stability in numbers never granted by any previous Administration; a streamlined organisation more relevant to future needs; and a complete reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The proposed reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force is an important element of the overall White Paper strategy and will be based <Col N="1121" /> on the publication of an in-depth study recently completed and a phased consultative process.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that there are not any proposals in the draft White Paper for any further barracks closures. A small reduction in personnel will, however, be required to release resources for reinvestment. However, through the use of more modern technology, civilianisation and better use of resources this can be absorbed. Overall, the capacity of the Defence Forces will be greatly enhanced. Restructuring of the Defence Forces will correct the imbalance in the pay:non-pay ratio and move towards the target ratio of 70:30. This will ensure the provision of a sustainable and affordable Defence Forces able to fulfil the roles laid down by the Government.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the White Paper will present many challenges to the Defence Forces. However, substantial change and reorganisation has been successfully carried out by the Defence Forces in the past three years. The Government has every confidence that the Defence Forces will rise to meet the challenge of completing the necessary reform process.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the White Paper on Defence is a statement of the Government's policy on defence. Governments are elected to make decisions and must be free to make these decisions. In no area of the public service is policy determined exclusively by those whose task it will be to implement those decisions and policies. I have described the developmental nature of the White Paper and am confident that everyone who has the welfare of the Defence Forces at heart can see the necessity for the measures proposed in it. Each of these measures represents a significant and necessary step along the road of reform.</P>
    <P>Given these facts, I am disappointed at the unrealistic and one-dimensional view of defence issues which has emanated from certain quarters. When the hyperbole is swept away, the criticism comes down to this proposition &ndash; give more money to the Defence Forces and everything will be all right. Here in the real world where important educational, health, social, economic or other public programmes catering for disadvantage would have to be cut back to provide this money, no provider of public services can reasonably expect to write his or her own budget. On the contrary, Government is obliged to set priorities and make difficult decisions.</P>
    <P>I will bring my proposals on the White Paper on Defence to Government for consideration shortly. Once approved by the Government, consultations on the White Paper will take place with the Defence Forces representative associations in accordance with the normal system of representation.</P>
    <P>As with all Government publications, the White Paper will be widely available following its publication.</P>

      <P>The Minister's denial that there has been a breakdown in the relationship <Col N="1122" /> between himself and members of the Defence Forces is disturbing because he is not facing up to the reality. What does he intend to do to deal with the serious breakdown that occurred? When will he meet the Chief of Staff and the general staff? What steps are being taken to ensure the White Paper when published will meet the objectives the Minister described which we all support?</P>

      <P>As I explained, the ongoing consultative process is proceeding and later this afternoon I will meet the Chief of Staff again to continue that process. The process will continue until the White Paper is presented to Government. It is important, however, to realise that the final decisions in these matters rests with the Government and it is not possible for any one organisation to decide its own budget. Within those parameters, everything possible is being done to meet the Defence Forces' priority, namely, the procurement of additional and better equipment for the Air Corps, the Army and the Naval Service. That principle is being adhered to to the fullest possible extent. This is evident both in terms of the resources we have made available and the ten year plan, which includes a process of constant recruitment and other measures, we have put in place.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that every effort is being made to achieve, within reason, as broad a consensus as possible. However, there will always be areas in respect of which, for one reason or another, it is not possible to reach agreement.</P>

      <P>I wish to offer my sympathy to the Minister, the Department of Defence and the Army on the tragic death in the Lebanon of four Army personnel. I also express my condolences to the Deere, Fitzpatrick, Lawlor and Murphy families.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that it is Government policy to implement the White Paper and to adhere to its recommendations on Defence Forces' funding. There is more to this matter than that. We are not concerned with Army personnel, the Chief of Staff, RACO or PDFORRA telling the Minister how to spend the money, we are inquiring about the negotiations and consultations that have taken place on the one matter in the Defence Forces which can be seen in negative terms at present, namely, morale.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he intends to meet the Chief of Staff today. How many meetings has he held with the Chief of Staff since the White Paper was initiated? How many meetings has he held with RACO and PDFORRA? What is the position in relation to the Chief of Staff returning from duty and not visiting Australia? The newspapers indicated that he had returned to Ireland because of the problems created by the White Paper. Did the Minister meet the Chief of Staff on his return to discuss that or will today's meeting be the first they have had since his return from his tour of duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> I live in south Kildare where many members of the Defence Forces live. I am informed that morale has never been as bad and it is due to a lack of consultation. How many meetings did the Minister hold with the Chief of Staff and with RACO? What is the position in regard to meetings with PDFORRA? How many of the proposals put forward by these people or organisations are included in the White Paper? Is it intended to change the White Paper further or is it ready for presentation to Government?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for his message of sympathy to the families of the four young privates who tragically lost their lives in Lebanon earlier this week. Their deaths, which occurred as they departed for a well earned holiday after their first engagement and tour of duty, have moved not just those of us who are close to the Defence Forces but everyone throughout the country. Go ndeine Dia trócaire ar a anama dílis.</P>
      <P>I met the Chief of Staff almost immediately after his return from duty. There have been frequent and ongoing discussions between my officials and the generals during this 18 month process. However, there does appear to be some misunderstanding of roles. As the Deputy is aware, the legislation which establishes the representative associations prohibits them from engagement in matters relating to the principal issues being covered by the White Paper. I will meet both associations next week to hold discussions on certain aspects of the White Paper which, perhaps, come within their remit.</P>
      <P>I have heard frequent media reports about low levels of morale in the Defence Forces. I meet soldiers all the time and I understand they may be concerned when forthcoming changes are misrepresented. Deputy Wall is aware that a number of newspapers, notwithstanding assurances to the contrary, carried stories that a number of Army barracks faced closure. I cannot control the actions of newspapers and such reports are upsetting for local personnel. However, they have my assurance that barracks will not be closed.</P>
      <P>I also assure them that the equipment they have sought, and which has not been given to them, to enable them to compete as a world class organisation will soon be in their possession for the first time. Military personnel have presented their case to me in respect of this matter and this is the first occasion on which their demands have been met. The way to deal with morale is to ensure that, when they travel abroad, our troops are as well equipped as anyone else and that they are not obliged to beg, borrow or steal. That is the basis of the ten year plan which is now being put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People should not be concerned about the guarantees which are contained in the White Paper, preparation of which must be concluded before it is presented to the Government on Tuesday week. We have left room on all <Col N="1124" /> occasions for negotiations to continue with the stakeholders. It must be borne in mind that the stakeholders are varied and include the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach, Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The people to whom we supply services have been consulted and their views must also be taken into account.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I join Deputy Wall in offering our condolences to the families, relatives and friends of Privates Deere, Murphy, Fitzpatrick and Lawlor on their tragic deaths.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree this development process began with the Gleeson commission in 1989 and was continued in the form of the Price Waterhouse report in 1994? On the covering letter with that report, Mr. Kelly, when trying to sum up the entire process, referred to caution in respect of undue focus on cost-cutting and stated that a radical overhaul would not be possible if approached on a cost-cutting basis. The Minister gave a fine reply to our questions which indicated that everything is rosy in the garden. I assure him this is not the case. Senior commanders in the Defence Forces were largely excluded from this development process.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wall inquired whether the Minister met the Chief of Staff since he returned to Ireland and he replied that he had. I would like to know if they discussed the proposed contents of the White Paper. When Deputy Fitzgerald heard that the Minister is meeting the Chief of Staff this afternoon she told me we should welcome that development. I agreed but, on reflection, we decided it was a pity that we feel obliged to welcome an announcement by the Minister for Defence that he is going to meet the Chief of Staff. Such meetings should take place on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I served in the Army and even then I was interested in politics. However, members of the Defence Forces often do not know the identity of the Minister for Defence. I assure the current Minister that his identity is well known to members of the Defence Forces. They know who he is, though not always for the right reasons.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the reduction in personnel would be small. In my view a 10% reduction in the current number of personnel, 11,500, is not minor, particularly in view of the fact that when other recent reductions are taken into account the figure is closer to 25%. Does the Minister not agree it is difficult to reconcile such a radical reduction in numbers given our signing up to Partnership for Peace and the loose commitment we gave at the Helsinki Summit regarding the creation of a rapid reaction force?</P>
      <P>It beggars belief that we are doing so on the one hand, while cutting back on the other. Things are not rosy in the garden and many military personnel with long experience feel totally excluded from the process because the Department has ignored their advice.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the White Paper would be before the Government if the Chief of Staff, David Stapleton, had not returned? These meetings are taking place after the work has been done on the White Paper. The Chief of Staff returned because of his concern about the White Paper. Suddenly a meeting is taking place today between the Minister and the Chief of Staff and there is the possibility of meetings next week with RACO and PDFORRA.</P>
      <P>The newspapers suggested that the White Paper was to go to Government at least a fortnight ago. I cannot believe that these meetings are going to take place at the end of the process instead of at the beginning when the views of these organisations, and particularly those of the Chief of Staff, could have been included in the process.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister suggesting there were no serious problems with this process? If that is the case it is very disturbing because it means he is not reflecting the true position. It would be more impressive if the Minister admitted that there had been difficulties and that the generals and the Chief of Staff felt completely excluded at one point from this important process. The Minister is denying this fact instead of facing up to the reality, accepting that there were difficulties and outlining what he is going to do so that they do not reoccur. Such a course of action would lead to a successful White Paper. The Minister should acknowledge that there was a serious breakdown in the relationship and outline what he is going to do to make sure it does not happen again.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and to decide its structure and numbers. Deputy Timmins referred to the reduction in numbers in the previous reform process under a redundancy scheme. The Deputy is aware that the majority of people who retired from the Defence Forces at that time were in the category C class. It would be an exaggeration to suggest that this caused enormous problems for the Defence Forces. However, there is no possibility of substantially increasing the envelope for the Defence Forces. There are significant demands on resources from other areas such as education, health and tackling disadvantage. Within that envelope I have been able to implement a major development programme by retaining the savings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins also spoke about a reduction in numbers from 11,500 to 10,500. The actual numbers at present are 10,900 so the effective reduction is 400. It is hard to credit that such a reduction could cause the kind of turmoil some suggest to a disciplined organisation, with a long tradition of loyalty to the State, and with new resources for equipment, refurbishment, DROPS, armoured personnel carriers and enhanced overseas operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, the Minister for Public Enterprise and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under S.I. No. 205, 1997 &ndash; Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations, 1997.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to this directive the investigation is being conducted by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator in charge. He is being assisted by inspectors from the AAIU, by Air Corps personnel and two experts from overseas &ndash; a principal inspector from the UK air accident investigation branch and the head of military psychology of the Swedish armed forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide ranging and complex, is to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents. All issues, including those raised by relatives concerning <Col N="1127" /> safety, are being encompassed by the investigation. The final report of this investigation will be made public.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide that the final report should be published, where possible, within 12 months of the date of the accident. In this connection it is estimated that a draft final report will be ready for circulation to interested parties by the end of next March. Any safety measures proposed by the investigation team will be implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report. Therefore, the work of the military court of inquiry will proceed following publication of the final report of the air accident investigation unit. The court of inquiry must also await the coroner's court findings. The coroner's court is adjourned until mid-July next.</P>
    <P>The future equipment requirements for the Air Corps and response thereto will he dealt with in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Defence. The purchase of a significant number of capital assets, such as new helicopters, would require considerable investment of State funds to finance the initial acquisition and the ongoing maintenance regimes which must be followed to ensure the fullest level of operational safety. Pursuing the objective of best use of financial resources, I must be satisfied that whatever procurement programme is embarked upon will be an integrated response to the real and realistic needs of the Air Corps and the Defence Forces overall in fulfilling their roles and tasks in the new organisation.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I recently established a civil-military board to examine urgently a number of issues in relation to Air Corps equipment, particularly in the context of flying training and the operation of the search and rescue service. I am awaiting the board's report.</P>

      <P>Are there any plans to replace the Dauphin helicopters, if so, at what cost and from where will the money come? Is the Minister concerned by recent media reports of incidents involving Air Corps aircraft? One such report concerned an incident in which a blanket became entangled in the rotary blades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to re-equipment and the estimated savings of £25 million per year over ten <Col N="1128" /> years accruing from reductions in personnel. This amounts to £250 million which is in addition to the extra £5 million per year for the Air Corps. Does the Minister agree that this money will only cover the funding of naval and aircraft equipment and that there is no provision for the Army in this figure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is a little unusual because it has been mentioned by people in full-time employment in the Defence Forces that this is a problem. The £300 million mentioned by the Deputy is in addition to existing resources. This year equipment and refurbishment for the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army totalled £62 million, which is the highest ever investment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right that £500 is not enough for the Air Corps. It is additional to the resources I have available to me normally. The Air Corps requires new aircraft and that is why the Military Civilian Board was established to indicate to me the type of aircraft the Air Corps requires. Once I get the report, we can proceed.</P>
      <P>As far as the Air Corps generally and the safety of the Dauphins are concerned, we have checked them out internationally and we have also heard from our personnel who, having worked with the Air Corps for a number of years, are safety conscious and do not fly aircraft which does not meet the stringent aviation standards. The report the Deputy requested will be available in March.</P>

These meetings are arranged for next week. In addition, I attended the delegate conferences of both associations late last year.</P>
      <P>The conciliation and arbitration scheme provides a mechanism within which issues which come within the associations' remit can and should be addressed. The scheme provides a range of fora to the associations from formal council and sub-committee meetings to less formal meetings and contacts. In addition, the civil and military staff of the conciliation and arbitration sections of the Department are available to the associations at all times and are, I understand, in almost daily contact with them.</P>

Without going into intimate details, what does the Minister talk to them about? He stated earlier that the issues in the White Paper did not come within their remit. Does he agree that the welfare of the Defence Forces personnel should come under their remit? Does he also agree that if there is a reduction of 10% in personnel it will impact on their welfare and that they should, therefore, have a say in the White Paper?</P>

Both associations published their submissions.</P>

We will continue to work and go forward together. I hope the meetings next week will continue that good relationship. They have a day to day association on a range of issues in relation to arbitration and conciliation with officials in my Department, which I welcome.

      <P>As regards the Defence Forces training headquarters, does the Minister agree that most of the training administration is done in the Curragh and most of the physical training is done in the Glen of Imaal in Wicklow? Would it be more appropriate to move this branch to that area rather than to Clonmel? I have no difficulty with the Minister moving a section to Clonmel. However, the people who comprise the training branch are transient people. If 30 or 40 people are moved to Clonmel they will not necessarily relocate to Clonmel but will commute long distances. The majority of the people who work in the training section live in the Kildare and Dublin areas. It might be more suitable to relocate them to the Curragh or Newbridge rather than Clonmel. While it is not too bad to move the Civil Defence to Roscrea, it would be better to move the military staff elsewhere.</P>

We are talking about the directorate which is not necessarily required to be in the Glen of Imaal or the Curragh on a regular basis. Clonmel is centrally located nationally. If we accepted Deputy Timmins's suggestion, the west, south-west and midlands would not qualify for what we hope they will get in time. He is lucky to live in the circle of the pale close to stadia, hospitals, theatres and big facilities. Clonmel and Roscrea are a long way away and we are looking for a chip of the Celtic tiger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 22, 27, 75, 77, 93 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The Government on 15 July 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which were considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located in Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth, Clancy barracks, will be evacuated this year.</P>
      <P>I have decided to dispose of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000. The land will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
      <P>The independent consultants appointed to draw up an integrated action area plan for the former barracks in Ballincollig undertook a rigorous process of public consultation as an integral part of their commission. The integrated plan for the future development of the property is complete and is awaited from the consultants.</P>
      <P>Agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property of Devoy barracks to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been rezoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC, as adopted on 29 May 1999. A tender competition was held in October 1999 for the appointment of selling agents to undertake the sale of the property. The Department, having considered the offers received, decided to re-invite tenders for selling agents. These were due on 14 February. A total of 14 tenders were received and these are currently being examined.</P>
      <P>Arising from a request by the Department of Foreign Affairs to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check their feasibility for the accommodation of the refugees. Currently, Magee barracks, Kildare is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim a tender competition has been arranged for the appointment of independent consultants to prepare an area action plan in respect of the former barracks land. A number of the proposals received were short listed and those consultants on the short list made presentations before a select committee on 16 February. The consultants selected will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as practicable following evaluation of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decided to sell the site of Castleblayney barracks to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker agreement has <Col N="1133" /> been completed between the North Eastern Health Board and my Department. The former barracks was handed over to the board on 9 February on foot of that agreement. It is envisaged that the child care project proposed by the health board for the site will provide 45 permanent appointments and a sum in excess of £1 million will be invested in the provision of the necessary facilities. In addition, the annual revenue for the town is estimated to be in the region of £1.2 million. The proposal from the North Eastern Health Board includes a gymnasium, an all-weather pitch and a swimming pool. I understand these facilities will be made available to the local community when not in use for child care purposes. In accordance with normal practice, all legal aspects of the sale will be handled by the Chief State Solicitor acting on my Department's behalf.</P>
    <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sales of barracks. I do not intend to close any other barracks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a figure of £50 million. Is that a projection or is it the sum realised? Does the Minister intend to spend this money on equipment for the Defence Forces? The Minister has reassured us that there will not be further barracks closures. There is concern in Longford that the barracks there will be closed. The Minister may say there will not be further closures but he must assure the House that the circumstances will not arise from a military point of view where some barracks are unavoidably closed. I hope the Minister is not trying to shift the onus on to the military.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>He has a sixth opportunity now. He knows that he does not have to ask such a question, I have indicated the position to the Deputy, in private .</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked if £50 million is a projected figure. It is, and I am optimistic that it will be exceeded. The money will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was a second tender competition held for Devoy barracks in Naas? What is the situation in Magee barracks in Kildare town? There has only been one meeting between the Minister's Department and the local area committee of Kildare County Council. There is concern in the area that there has not been any movement. It is possible to plan for the outcome while the refugees are still there. Can the Minister assure me that every effort will be made to speed up the process? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that it was necessary to re-advertise for selling agents in Naas. It is an <Col N="1134" /> extremely valuable property and we were anxious to test the market as soon as possible. There was a selling agent who wanted to be told when the tenders were to be advertised but who missed the opportunity to submit a tender. It was re-advertised to afford the fullest opportunity to someone in that category. The delay was short, however, because the tenders have been received and are now being considered.</P>
      <P>There has been only one meeting with the local representatives. The focus now is on the area action plan, the selection of the consultants and their preparation of the work which can proceed while the refugees are housed in the barracks. We hope that will be temporary and as soon as the action plan is presented to me, it will be published and we will then have further discussions with local representatives. It would not help to have further meetings now because the focus is on the preparation of the action plan and once that is ready we will be in business. I hope that the site will be free as well so that we could proceed both with the sale and the local discussions.</P>

Discussions are also taking place with the local authorities for the dispersal of the land for housing purposes in a multi-mix programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minster announced the closure of a number of barracks throughout the country it was anticipated that a specific sum would be realised. How does that sum compare with today's evaluation of the properties concerned and to what extent has a revision been made in respect of the valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is early to revise the sum, which is probably a little conservative at this stage because of the way property prices are increasing. In at least two cases we are dealing with the local authority and meeting a distinct local need. In another case we are dealing with the North Eastern Health Board to meet a distinct need. I believe the sum will be exceeded but I do not believe it is necessary to revise it upwards at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have selected three sites for sale in different parts of the country. However, we are undertaking a more rigorous assessment <Col N="1135" /> of our total land and property portfolio outside of barracks to see what else we can offer in terms of easing the pressure on housing and assisting local authorities, sports clubs, etc. We are not in the business of keeping property that is surplus to requirements and a vigorous assessment is being undertaken to bring it to the market. Once again, the funds raised will be allocated to the re-equipment and refurbishment of the Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that any moneys would be allocated to re-equipment. Is he aware that General McMahon made this point in <i>The Irish Times</i>? He pointed out that because of our commitments under the Petersberg Tasks there would be a need to lower personnel numbers and invest in equipment. Is that the case and, if so, was the Green Party not the only party to make that point and is it not also the case that the Army can only trust the Green Party in these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned with a modest reduction from the current number of 10,900 to 10,500. However, I do not ignore that this will cause problems. Present thinking is based primarily on the views put forward by the military leadership for many years that it did not have the equipment necessary for it to perform the different tasks asked of it, whether under our commitments to the UN or in Europe. We want the Defence Forces to be more professional, better equipped, better trained, younger and to have the kind of equipment which enables it to perform the tasks required of it.</P>
      <P>Last year we spent £210,000 on each of the DROPS, 12 of which are now in operation in Kosovo where 100 men and women are stationed. They can travel on any terrain and can transport food, timber and building requirements or whatever else. Nowadays there must be the support, technology, equipment and flexibility to perform these tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point. Is it not the case that we must pay for EU missions, whereas UN missions were paid for? We must carry out the Petersberg Tasks and we will have to pay for it. Is that not the issue here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I answered this question on the last occasion. We are developing a strong economy. The UN has considerable problems in getting the necessary financial resources and it is already in considerable arrears. <Col N="1136" /> It is also in arrears with us for operations in UNIFIL of approximately £8 million or £9 million.</P>
      <P>As our economy becomes stronger we want to provide proper equipment for the members of the Defence Forces. We do not want to put out our hand and to be dependent on others to be able to meet our commitments. It is all right if there are funds available from the UN for our operations there, but this country is an independent republic and it should try to serve on a humanitarian basis. This means moving into problem areas in different parts of the world. We should do the best we can in such circumstances, not only in terms of providing the Defence Forces and the necessary equipment, but also in terms of financial support. While that is what will be expected of us, we should also do it by right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the Minister's reply to my last question. He appeared to infer that the driving force for this rationalisation in the military areas will be funded from the sale of assets. I do not see how that will happen. A sum of £50 million was identified in the first instance, while in previous responses the Minister indicated that more money would have to be realised to pay for the revisions he has in mind.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the morale of the Army and the Defence Forces generally and the need to maintain a worthwhile Army, does the Minister consider it advisable to have as a common denominator the need to sell assets to pay for it? If one goes down that road one will eventually end up with no Army. I am concerned with the tone of the Minster's replies to questions on this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Fermoy recently. The site that was previously the Fitzgerald Camp was sold to the local authority and to the IDA for the development of local enterprise. In addition, an acre was allocated to the FCA and the church was bequeathed to the parish. All the local representatives were delighted with this because they had the opportunity to develop this very valuable site.</P>
      <P>Funds from these transactions are not the only ones being put into equipment. The new plan proposes an additional £30 million per year for ten years. This year, outside of all of these developments, my Department expended £62 million on equipment and refurbishment. The Deputy must take these three components into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Last month I had the opportunity to pay a short visit to Kosovo where I met with Irish troops serving with the 1st Irish Contingent (Transport Company), KFOR. The primary purpose of my visit was to see at first hand the work of the Irish military personnel serving in the region and to convey to them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, the deep appreciation felt regarding the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service.</P>
      <P>During the course of my visit I attended a medal parade where the guest of honour was General Klaus Reinhardt, overall Commander of the 48,000 troops serving with KFOR. I was proud to hear again the fulsome praise for the Irish Defence Forces from a commanding officer of a multinational force. Dr. Reinhardt paid a glowing tribute to the achievements of all the Irish personnel serving with KFOR and to the &ldquo;great contribution they have made to the rebuilding of a country&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw again how the hearts of Irish soldiers are touched by the humanitarian catastrophe which is prevalent in Kosovo. Since the Irish troops set up Camp Clarke in Pristina they have raised funds to rebuild the homes of several families. I was personally touched by the devastation I wit<Col N="1138" /> nessed in Kosovo. In order to allow the Irish Contingent continue with their humanitarian efforts, I was delighted to be in a position to make a grant of £10,000 available for suitable projects to be identified and undertaken by the Irish Contingent. I know that the soon to depart 2nd Irish Contingent (Transport Company), KFOR, will continue this humanitarian work and have already arranged to take out with them two containers of clothes and toys for distribution to the local population.</P>
    <P>I regard Irish participation in KFOR as an important and practical expression of our ongoing commitment to peacekeeping in general and to the cause of peace and stability in Kosovo. Furthermore, it responds to the foreign policy priority of staying in the mainstream of peacekeeping at a time when the UN is increasingly turning to regional solutions for peacekeeping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have a clear indication regarding a potential outbreak of hostilities in Tipperary given that he recently moved the Civil Defence to Roscrea and the training unit to Clonmel. I was not aware that there was a danger of a hostile invasion of Tipperary, but there will be a political invasion in Kilkenny if the decisions recently made by the Minister to bolster troops in Tipperary have an adverse effect on the numbers employed as civilians and in the Army in Kilkenny. I am not satisfied that a recent decision regarding the amalgamation of the 3rd and 30th Battalions has been fully implemented with the necessary speed and efficiency. Has the Minister plans to ensure that Kilkenny retains its status as the headquarters of the amalgamated battalions? Are there are plans to increase the number of Army personnel serving in Kilkenny? Also, what plans are there to increase the civilian numbers, in light of the building work anticipated for Kilkenny in future?</P>

      <P>There probably were some rumours that people from Kilkenny were going to come over the county boundary and cause some trouble for us. This might have led to the decision, but I do not deal primarily with security matters and do not have control over matters of intelligence.</P>
      <P>Seriously, there is no threat to Kilkenny. I will undertake to examine the matter and request the Chief of Staff to inform me of the delays which have taken place regarding the transfers. The execution of such matters is primarily for the military. All barracks are involved in an ongoing programme of refurbishment and I know a significant investment was made in Kilkenny in recent years. However, there is obviously other work which needs to be considered and I will examine this in the context of this year's building programme.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps fleet comprises 14 helicopters, including one operated on behalf of the Garda Síochána. The types of aircraft involved are as follows: seven Alouette III, two Gazelle, four Dauphin and one Ecureil AS355N.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the aircraft are operational and undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to <Col N="1143" /> ensure they are fully airworthy and meet the certification standards laid down for the aviation industry. Subject to air safety parameters, which take account of factors such as meteorological conditions, terrain, mission, etc., three Dauphin and the Garda helicopters are equipped for operational night flying. The Dauphin helicopters were bought in the period 1982-84 and underwent major overhaul by the manufacturers in the mid-1990s at a cost of more than £4 million. Similar overhauls are due to be performed again in the period 2001 to 2003. In the course of ongoing maintenance, it is necessary to comply with air safety requirements by following a very strict regime of replacement of parts which are time expired or have achieved usage milestones. In the past three years almost £5 million was spent on Dauphin replacement parts and contract repairs.</P>
    <P>The electronic navigation equipment which was originally fitted to the Dauphin was the most modern of its type at that time. However, recently the manufacturers have curtailed technical support and despite the best efforts of the Air Corps this equipment has become increasingly more difficult to maintain. This situation has resulted in one Dauphin not being available for night flying operations while continuing to be available on the same basis as the Alouettte and Gazelle for day time use under visual flight procedures.</P>
    <P>The question of installing a new navigation system on the Dauphin helicopters is being examined. Such equipment might well cost up to £2 million per aircraft and the most appropriate opportunity for installation will arise during the scheduled overhauls due to commence next year. Obviously the total cost of the overhauls, including the fitting of a new navigation system, would be very substantial and a close analysis of the matter will be required to establish whether proceeding with that work or taking an alternative approach would offer the most cost effective solution.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in an earlier question the civil military board will bring forward recommendations as to the more appropriate, sensible and practical action having regard to the resources available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a related topic, has the Government plans to replace the Government jet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The White Paper states that if that question arose, additional funds would have to be provided because there was speculation that the funds would have to come from the savings about which we spoke. That will not be the case if it is decided to proceed on that basis at any stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the Dauphin helicopters cannot land at Government Buildings because of safety factors?</P>

    <Col N="1144" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate for me to comment on such matters. In my experience, the Air Corps personnel are very safety conscious and take all considerations into account. They decide where to fly and where they can and cannot land. This is not a matter on which I would have expertise or involvement. I rely on the expertise of the Air Corps to make these decisions and not to fly aircraft where the strictest aviation standards are not met.</P>

Tenders have been invited for the main project comprising construction of the new 25 metre pool and the upgrading of the existing gymnasium, and are due for return on 15 March 2000. Tenders for the provision of mechanical and electrical sub-contract services are expected to be issued before the end of this month. It is anticipated that work on the project will commence in June 2000 and will take approximately 12 months to complete.

      <Quest>the position regarding the investigation into the crash of an Air Corps helicopter in July 1999 in which four personnel were killed; if a senior Air Corps engineer warned his superiors that crucial flying equipment in the Dauphin helicopter was obsolete less than six months before the crash; the action, if any, taken as a result of this warning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 37 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>Following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under Statutory Instrument No. 205 of 1997, Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations, 1997. Pursuant to this direction the investigation is being conducted by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator-in-charge. He is being assisted by inspectors from the AAIU, Air Corps personnel and two overseas experts &ndash; a principal inspector from the UK air accident investigation branch and the head of military psychology of the Swedish armed forces.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide-ranging and complex, is to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident to prevent future such accidents. I met relatives of the deceased both immediately following the tragic accident last July and since then. These meetings were of a private and confidential nature and, therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to elaborate further. All issues, including those raised by relatives concerning safety, are being encompassed by the investigation. The final report of the investigation will be made public.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide that the final report should be published, where possible, within 12 months of the date of the accident. In this connection it is estimated that a draft final report will be ready for circulation to interested parties by the end of March next. Any safety measures proposed by the investigation team will, of course, be implemented as a matter of priority. As the investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on any aspect of its deliberations. All aircraft in the Air Corps fleet undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to ensure they are fully airworthy and meet the certification standards laid down for the aviation industry. All Air Corps aircraft are certified serviceable before flight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a Military Court of Inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the <Col N="1146" /> accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report. Therefore, the work of the Military Court of Inquiry will proceed following publication of the final report of the air accident investigation unit. The court of inquiry must also await the Coroner's Court findings. I am informed that the Coroner's Court is adjourned until mid-July next.</P>
    <P>The future equipment requirements for the Air Corps and response thereto will be dealt with in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Defence. The purchase of a significant number of capital assets such as new helicopters would require considerable investment of State funds to finance the initial acquisition and the ongoing maintenance regimes which must be followed to ensure the fullest level of operational safety. Pursuing the objective of best use of financial resources, I must be satisfied that whatever procurement programme is embarked upon will be an integrated response to the real and realistic needs of the Air Corps and the Defence Forces overall in fulfilling their roles and tasks in the new organisation. In the meantime, I recently established a civil military board to examine urgently a number of issues on Air Corps equipment, particularly in the context of flying training and the operation of the search and rescue service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>If a senior Air Corps engineer warned his superiors of problems in relation to flying equipment, is there a letter on the Department's records?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be extremely unwise and inappropriate for me to make any comment on such a question. There is an investigation going on and a Military Court of Inquiry is being established. The experts dealing with the matter have all the papers available to them and the help of international experts to determine what was the cause or causes of the accident. The Deputy will appreciate, in that circumstance, it would not be appropriate for a Minister to refer to comments made by individuals, whether before or after the accident.  </P>

    <Title>Planning and Development Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is comprehensive and consolidating by nature, but a number of amendments need to be made to it. I have a number of suggestions to put to the Minister during my contribution and on Committee Stage. It is a pity that Members have only 20 minutes to make a contribution because one could spend that amount of time discussing each section because it is such detailed legislation and all of us have a huge interest in it.</P>
      <P>I have serious concerns about the blanket removal of the exemption for turf cutting and peat extraction from the provisions in the legislation. Both of these practices are of major economic importance to the midlands with thousands of jobs directly or indirectly reliant on them. A number of small farmers are employed by Bord na Móna on a seasonal or full-time basis. Their farms would be uneconomic without such off-farm income. Four peat fired power stations, namely Lanesboro, Shannonbridge, Ferbane and Rhode, are currently under threat of closure following a recent International Energy Agency report on Ireland. The Minister for Public Enterprise has done little to allay those fears. If additional regulations and restrictions in regard to peat extraction are put in place, it would further compound the viability of these plants and the new peat fired power station which is about to be commissioned in County Offaly. Many small commercial producers have invested heavily in equipment and the development of bogs and their livelihoods are in jeopardy as a result of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> A farmer who lives near me has developed his own bogs and has reared his family on the income he has earned from saving and selling turf. Four of his eight children attended university and he was able to fund their education through the living he earned from cutting turf on his own bog. The Minister is introducing legislation which will restrict that practice. The problem lies in section 2, page 17, lines 17 to 23. This section provides definitions which are referred to later in the Bill. The definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; has been changed from that in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, by omitting any reference to the use of turbary.</P>
    <P>Given that agriculture is exempted development and the Bill does not further refer to turbary, it is, therefore, no longer exempted from the planning controls as forming part of agriculture in the normal sense. While this explanation may be complex, it equates the requirement of planning permission for turf extraction and boglands, thereby removing a long held right of people to cut turf and greatly restrict the traditional right of turbary, which many families hold and which is unique to Ireland. If the Bill remains in its current format, it would then fall to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to enact regulations which would exempt some turf cutting from the requirement to seek planning permission.</P>
    <P>However, two further issues must be taken into consideration. First, the recent case of the European Commission <i>vs.</i> Ireland on 21 September 1999 in which Ireland was held to have failed to properly transpose the environmental impact assessment directive, 1985, by failing to assess its effects on the environment of afforestation projects under 70 hectares and peat extraction projects in sensitive bogland areas. One element of the judgment regarding the need for an EIS on sensitive bogs has already been resolved through the introduction of two regulations, namely SIs 22 and 23 of 1999. The second element of the judgment, which expressed concern about the cumulative effect of a number of small projects, could be resolved through the county development plan.</P>
    <P>Second, as many people involved in the campaign against the implementation of the habitats directive have realised, the interpretation of any regulations set down by the Minister of the day can be re-interpreted at a future date. For example, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who signed the Habitats Directive when he was Minister, recently informed an Oireachtas committee which debated the issue that it was his intention when he signed it that it would only prohibit the use of sausage machines on designated bogs, not stopping turf cutting on these bogs completely.</P>
    <P>This is not how the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands interprets the directive currently and a similar problem may arise at a future date regarding the interpretation of this legislation in terms of the regulations on turf cutting. Requiring impact assessments of <Col N="1149" /> small bogs would prevent extraction due to the cost of such assessment versus the value of the turf which would be extracted. Large tracts of bogland in the midlands have already been designated special areas of conservation and if this legislation is enacted in its current form, it would sterilise further large tracts of bogland with a major impact on the rural economy of these areas.</P>
    <P>The European Union cannot be allowed to override Irish rural life to the detriment of those who are forced out of their communities into major urban centres. This completely contradicts its stated policy of rural development. However, the EU is willing to take the economic significance of its directives into consideration and provide opt-out clauses to member states if they are willing to make a case on behalf of the people affected. A Minister who introduces legislation such as this and whose sole argument for its introduction is the fulfilment of EU directives is clearly indicating that he is incapable of making a case on behalf of the people and he should consider his position.</P>
    <P>The Government has adopted a policy of rural proofing, which it claims will assess all policy and legislation to ensure that it will not impact to the detriment of rural life and its traditions. This Bill was not rural proofed and the Minister is taking a jaundiced view of EU directives by not seeking a balance between environmental concerns and the traditional rights of the people. There have been numerous debates in the House on the habitats directives and the preservation of bogland. Over the years, it has been stated that we need to conserve our bogs and the flora and fauna in them. Large tracts of land have been designated for conservation. If people who live in areas surrounded by bog, which is worthless and much of which is ploughed by Bord na Móna anyway, can earn a little income from it they should not be prevented from doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he will exempt turf cutting for domestic use from the requirement to seek planning permission. I hope the Minister will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to define that, because the people affected will not stand by and allow him to bring in regulations when the legislation is passed which can be interpreted to the liking of somebody who wants to make a point at some future time. The Minister must write into the legislation the restrictions he wants to put in place and ensure that small rural communities can produce small levels of turf on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>An issue relevant to my constituency is planning permission along the river Shannon. It is extremely difficult for young couples to get planning permission in parishes along the banks of the river Shannon. If the top of a chimney would be seen through the trees from a boat on the river, the local authority will refuse the planning application. We all want to ensure that communities are supported in rural Ireland yet we are forcing <Col N="1150" /> these young people out of their own communities because they are unable to obtain planning permission. Once an organisation in Dublin sees a planning application in a townland along the River Shannon, it immediately lodges an objection without even seeing the site or the way it will impact on the Shannon. These bodies are not accountable to anyone, yet they can dictate to communities up and down the River Shannon in terms of where they can and cannot build.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House has had visits from young couples who received a letter from their local authority on the last day of the two months period requesting further information. Much of the time the further information has already been supplied and the only reason for the request is that the local authority does not have the staff or the ability to deal with the process. Rather than giving a decision within two months, the authority gives them the decision within four months. I know the Minister will address this issue in the legislation and will restrict the waiting time to a certain extent, but there will be an increase in the length of time people have to wait for planning permission which is delayed by stupid queries from the local authority. These queries are designed to give the planning officer more time to examine the file.</P>
    <P>There are serious problems in local authorities in terms of the ability of staff to deal with planning applications. In my electoral area we have had five planning officers in the past 12 months. The latest planning officer is only just out of college and when she is making a decision on whether to grant planning permission, she refers to her text book. It is not acceptable for somebody just out of college to have the responsibility of a planning officer and to use a text book to decide whether to grant planning permission or to decide the conditions she will impose.</P>
    <P>An example of this ludicrous situation is that in rural areas, according to the text books, houses should have traditional small windows. This planning officer has given planning permission for a house which has six small narrow windows on the front, which is supposed to blend in with the rural area, while every other house around it has big bay windows. It is the most stupid decision I have ever come across, but that is what it says in the text book and that is the restriction she will put in place. It is ludicrous that planning officers are now deciding the type of glass that should be put into the window of a house.</P>
    <P>Another aspect concerns pillars on the porch of a house. In my electoral area, the planning authority will not allow concrete columns on the porch of a house yet it allowed a house to be erected with six two-storey high columns. These are big, white monstrosities. The house looks like the Southfork ranch we saw on &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; many years ago. This was allowed by the local authority because when conditions are imposed, they are not followed up. Roscommon County Council has not ever taken a case against any builder or householder who has broken the planning con<Col N="1151" /> ditions, and anyone who has applied for retention has received it. There are a number of elements to the reason for that but that is the position in my local authority. A slatted house was built beside a householder, not the width of this Chamber away from his house, yet an application was lodged for retention of planning permission and was granted. That means that other people are losing their rights because the local authority does not have the ability or the powers to enforce the regulations as they stand. I know the Minister has examined this issue in the legislation and I hope we will see change in it.</P>
    <P>I refer to cowboy developers who come in, slap up six or eight houses in an estate and take off again without completing it. These estates end up looking like somewhere in Bosnia rather than Ireland. Yet, when these builders apply to the local authority for planning permission for another development, it is granted. As for the bonding system, that is a complete joke because the moneys involved would not be sufficient to carry out the work if the local authority took it over. Serious restrictions must be put in place for this type of development. A developer should not be allowed to re-apply to a planning authority for additional planning permission without having met all the conditions of the previous application to the satisfaction of the local authority. It is ludicrous that estates are left unfinished and I hope that problem will be addressed in this legislation. However, what about the estates that have been left unfinished to date? This legislation is not retrospective and those estates will be left high and dry. The local authorities washed their hands of them because they do not want anything to do with this type of estate.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem with the management structure of local authorities. I am a member of a local authority but I have no say in planning applications. The only say I have as a local authority member is in the county development plan and the officials will re-phrase that document to suit themselves and then take a completely new interpretation of the plan when it is completed. Part of the problem is that we, as local authority members, have allowed management to pull the wool over our eyes. The system currently in place, where we are a glorified rubber stamp, is a disgrace. People do not realise that their elected public representatives have no say in what goes on and that the county manager dictates to us. The planning officials, county engineer and county manager come together to decide what course to take. What the local authority members say or do makes no difference.</P>
    <P>We also need to examine the situation regarding amenities. There are instances of local authorities, like private developers, developing estates without amenities. I am aware of one estate, started 25 years ago, which does not have a green area even though there are 1,000 houses in the development. There are many social problems in <Col N="1152" /> the estate and the buck stops with the local authority. It reneged on its duty to those people.</P>
    <P>There will be a better opportunity to discuss the Bill's provisions in detail on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on producing this Bill at such speed. He is at the coalface of the problems and challenges created by our economic success. He has the difficult task of providing housing in adequate time to fulfil the needs, wishes and ambitions of a new generation of people who wish to be housed in the same type of accommodation enjoyed by their parents' generation. It is a huge challenge but the Minister has met it with great speed and innovation. This is a time for innovative measures in this area.</P>
      <P>Existing planning legislation has been described as a &ldquo;crank's charter&rdquo; and the Minister and his Department are to be complimented on their comprehensive revision and consolidation of planning law which will provide the positive legislative framework within which the Government's major initiatives on housing and infrastructure incorporated in the development plan can be effectively brought to fruition. Of the projected £40.6 billion to be spent in the national development plan, £21 billion or just over 50% will be invested in social and economic infrastructure. This is an average annual spend of £3 billion.</P>
      <P>This means we must get our planning laws and structures in order. More than 42,000 houses were completed in 1998, a record in itself. The number of planning permissions for housing in 1998 was up 27% on 1997 and continued to grow during 1999. This will ensure continued output growth. However, we need to identify bottlenecks wherever they occur and speedily take the necessary measures to eliminate them. This applies not only to planning but throughout the economy and economic life.</P>
      <P>There is growing concern that simply changing planning law and procedures will not suffice. Planning guidelines on residential density, issued last September, will ensure more efficient use of serviced development land, facilitate provision of more affordable housing and promote sustainable development. Local authorities and An Bord Pleanála are required by law to have regard to these guidelines. I hope they will take them on board. My experience in the private sector with Esat Digifone is that sometimes the guidelines are not taken on board. I hope the Minister will strengthen them where necessary or translate them into regulations if that is required to speed up the provision of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major expansion of social housing is planned with an expenditure of £6 billion over the next six years, compared to £2.4 billion spent over the past six years. It is an impressive amount. The Government's housing and infrastructural programmes in the national plan have received a broad welcome from the construction industry. This positive reaction is exemplified in the recent annual review from Patterson, Kempster and <Col N="1153" /> Shortall, who are reputable commentators as well as practitioners in the industry. They are particularly complimentary about the introduction of multi-annual planning and the positive benefits this brings to the sector.</P>
    <P>It creates a stable set of parameters within which individual firms can plan without having to factor in a major risk element relating to possible changes in Government policy. The construction sector welcomes the certainty provided by this Government's policies. It can now be further reassured by the provisions of this Bill which set out clearly the statutory framework within which their business plans can be implemented. The measures in the Bill, designed to streamline the planning system and speed up the processing of planning applications, will assist in ensuring that delays to necessary housing developments are minimised.</P>
    <P>Not only are financial resources being committed to solving housing and infrastrucutral problems but they are also being supported by the commitment of additional human resources. Additional staffing has been provided in local authority planning departments. Staff numbers are now 14% higher than in 1998 in the planning departments of cities and surrounding counties with further increases in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>However, there is developing concern that one of the major impediments to rapid housing and infrastrucutral development is a growing shortage of qualified town planners. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today by William K. Nowlan argues that although the country has 300 qualified planners, the current and projected developments require at least 700 to 750 town planners if projects are not to suffer undue delay. The UCD school of town planning is the only establishment turning out planners in the State and it has a current output of 20 to 25 planners per annum. If Mr. Nowlan's contention is correct or only partly correct, it creates a major difficulty for the fulfilment of many important aspects of the national plan. I hope the Minister, in partnership with the Minister for Education and Science, will examine this issue.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities and developers are critically dependent on the professional services and experience of qualified town planners to prepare and evaluate development plans for housing and infrastructure. The number of planning applications has increased enormously, as has their level of detail and complexity. Potential litigation under any of a number of headings is a growing consideration for all involved in the process. This inevitably leads to longer times taken to process individual planning applications.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Government has moved swiftly and effectively to deal with identified resource constraints in the economy, both in the public and private sectors. It would be advisable for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Education and Science to collaborate with UCD and other colleges in instituting a crash programme for the <Col N="1154" /> production of town planners. This was done in the courts some years ago when serious delays were being experienced within the system. There was a crash programme of education to provide sufficient personnel to clear the backlogs. This is an obvious paradigm for what could be done in relation to the planning system.</P>
    <P>Membership of An Bord Pleanála has been increased from six to ten. The board has also received significant additional staffing with staff numbers up from 70 in 1995, under the rainbow Government, to 105 in 1999. The board's Exchequer grant has almost doubled in the same period. All housing and apartment development appeals of more than 50 units are being allocated priority status by An Bord Pleanála at all stages. Appeals are being monitored on a weekly basis by the chief officer and priority is being given to processing housing cases.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure, through the creative provisions of this Bill, that this progress is maintained and that no delays are attributable to a lack of human or financial resources at the board. The provisions of section 105 in relation to the employment of other than permanent full-time staff could and should be availed of in this regard. The section might be amended to enable the employment of staff in a short-term capacity.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government heard a worrying testimony yesterday from Mr. Michael Tobin, chief executive of the National Roads Authority. His testimony was to the effect that the domestic construction sector did not have the capacity to undertake many of the major infrastructural projects in the national development plan and that only projects over a certain size &ndash; for example, £100 million &ndash; would be successful in attracting foreign contractors. Here, clearly, is another bottleneck waiting to be tackled. It must be tackled. Not only will failure to tackle it result in delays in projects in the national plan but the inexorable laws of economics mean that where demand outstrips supply there will be major inflationary pressures in this sector.</P>
    <P>The necessity for a comprehensive and integrated range of initiatives to address unfulfilled demand in the housing market through measures on house pricing, removal of constraints and delays to investment, fiscal measures and measures to assist housing affordability will be significantly assisted by the passage of this Bill. While not wishing to diminish or play down other important components of the Bill, the statutory framework to be put in place in relation to housing supply is of the utmost importance. It is a clear indication of the Government's recognition of housing as a continuing priority.</P>
    <P>The commitment to a comprehensive housing policy will maximise housing output and supply and promote affordable housing for all. It will free up land for development through the serviced land initiative which was introduced in 1997. Exchequer funding of £39 million is being provided towards water and sewerage schemes to <Col N="1155" /> open up land for residential development. Total investment, including local development levies, will come to £100 million. The initiative will yield 100,000 sites by the end of this year. Approximately 100 schemes commenced construction in 1999 producing over 60,000 serviced sites. A further 43 schemes are due to commence this year yielding a further 35,000 sites. Local authorities are being asked to allow the use of temporary waste water treatment facilities to allow development to commence in advance of permanent facilities. For example, in Dublin's north fringe this has the potential to bring forward up to 16,000 sites for construction in advance of completion of the north fringe interceptor sewer in 2002. These measures exemplify the Government's creative approach to resolving planning bottlenecks in the housing development process.</P>
    <P>There were 4,500 local authority housing starts in 1999, the highest level since 1986. A multi-annual local authority housing programme of 22,000 starts over a four year period from 2000 to 2003 will commence this year. The authorities are being notified of their starts under the programme. Net local authority need has increased by 40% from 27,400 in 1996 to 39,100 at present, which underlines the urgency of the multi-annual programme and the accelerated social housing programme. The commitment to increase local authority housing stock by an additional 22,000 dwellings to be built over the next four years will have a major impact, especially on disadvantaged areas. The various provisions should reinforce and further facilitate planning authorities in major urban areas to rapidly develop both private and identified surplus State lands through the creation of temporary water and sewerage treatment facilities and by application of the recently announced high density guidelines to rapidly boost housing supply.</P>
    <P>It is also heartening to see that statutory provision is being made to ensure that planning authorities are permitted to take the necessary measures to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds. The continuing economic boom with the associated and inevitable differential impact on incomes renders positive action on social inclusion and cohesiveness all the more necessary. I support this initiative because I represent a constituency which manifests some of the worst planning mistakes and blight from earlier decades. Planning for socially integrated housing is an important element in promoting such cohesiveness. I trust planning authorities will learn from their past mistakes in the planning of housing schemes and use the building provisions in a creative fashion which will attempt to remedy past deficiencies and prevent their repetition in future.</P>
    <P>It is no accident that the area I represent developed as it did. It was severely badly planned, disgracefully so in many ways. It is an example of the type of bad planning we now hope is a thing <Col N="1156" /> of the past. I know the Minister is committed to high quality standards in the planning process. I make a late appeal to him to address the issue of in-fill housing and perhaps even issue a guideline to local authorities about how they should deal with in-fill housing. There is a patchy record in terms of individual authorities. One can have an in-fill application rejected on the same street as a person who could have their application accepted very quickly. That is an issue the Minister should address as well as the development of mews housing in back laneways of older, more traditional and now privately owned local authority housing. This is exemplified in areas such as Walkinstown and Greenhills where this type of development could bring new housing stock into commission. I conclude my comments on that and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Good planning and housing play a major role in the type of society we have and will have in future. I was interested by some of Deputy Lenihan's comments about the availability of qualified planners. I am in favour of qualifications and education. However, some areas of Dublin which are now famous and which I represent, such as Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock and Glasthule, or other areas, such as Malahide on the northside of Dublin, were developed many years ago when we did not have local authorities similar in size to those which exist today, or fully qualified personnel in planning departments. Nonetheless, a village atmosphere and communities within those villages were achieved. Much of that was based on common sense. There was mixed development and people supporting communities within a community. We have lost our way in terms of the type of development which is now taking place.</P>
      <P>I was first elected to a local authority in 1974 and, at that stage, the development plan which brought about Tallaght and Clondalkin was in place. It was obvious that we were zoning land where there were pipes, but people forgot about communities which had to develop within these regions. For many years, couples were left without basic facilities. There was no co-ordination in the provision of public transport or shopping facilities. Large blocks of local authority housing were situated in the one area with up to 85% unemployment within communities. This was supposed to be good planning and the creation of new towns to support the greater Dublin area. However, planning is about people and politicians are public representatives. We are supposed to represent people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much that is good in the Bill and good planning and housing dictate the type of society we will have in future. However, we are trying to ignore reality and the fact that we still have a local government structure which does not have a say in the provision of transport, what type of service the transport company, be it public or private, provides and whether there will be a connection between developed areas. It is plainly <Col N="1157" /> obvious that there is a lack of a spatial plan. Dublin is becoming choked. While there is Luas and public-private partnerships, the reality is that we are shoving the boundaries out further with no transport mechanism to match it. If there is a spatial plan, the infrastructure is installed to enable it to be put in place, serviced land and a transport system which works are then provided and then the powers of the local authority are examined.</P>
    <P>There are many rules and regulations in the Bill governing planning and housing. There is a lot to be said for housing strategies and incorporating them into development plans. There can be as many housing strategies as one would wish for, but if local authorities are starved of resources, have no power and have no input into the public transport system, they will not work. Dublin is becoming crowded. My side of Dublin is now moving out as far as Greystones, and the northside and the west are moving out to Navan, Carlow, Kilkenny and Kildare with everyone travelling to the city centre to work.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for 20% of developed land to be set aside for affordable and social housing, but what is to be done with local authorities such as Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council or Dublin Corporation which have no land? What housing strategies will provide houses for the people who are living in appalling conditions in the areas to which I referred? What will happen to these people where house prices are soaring and one pays a minimum of £160,000, £170,000 or £180,000 for a three bedroom semi-detached house? Recently a local authority house was sold in my area for £170,000. If the Minister provides a housing strategy which will be incorporated into the development plan of Dún Laoighaire-Rathdown County Council, there will be a need to build houses on the Dublin mountains. Land which is currently zoned for amenity purposes will be plastered with houses because that local authority will have to provide a housing strategy.</P>
    <P>There are more than 2,000 people on the Dún Laoighaire-Rathdown County Council housing list and, if my memory is correct, the council will build between 40 and 50 houses this year. It was easier to get a local authority house based on the points system in 1976 than it is in 2000. There are people with three children, who have maximum medical points, who live in grossly overcrowded conditions, have been six years on the housing list and are placed 60th or 70th on the waiting list. A housing strategy incorporated into the development plan will not solve the problems of such people who live in the Dún Laoighaire-Rathdown County Council area.</P>
    <P>All this assumes that each local authority has plenty of land available and they have the luxury of deciding in advance how many acres will be zoned, but this will change the face of Dublin. There will be high density housing everywhere. If a local authority is to meet its obligations as provided for under the Bill, it will have to start rezoning land which is currently zoned for amen<Col N="1158" /> ity purposes. What sort of society will there be then? Will it be the case that one will be unable to even walk up the Dublin mountains to get a bit of fresh air because the place will be jammed with houses, or will the local authorities be unable to provide parks such as those which they have been providing over the past 20 years? This will be the Dublin scenario, whatever about counties which have plenty of land available where the strategy may work.</P>
    <P>The other provision which involves an obligation to provide 20% of land for affordable and social housing is a good aspiration. I am in favour of providing houses at a reasonable price for young couples in particular, but the reality is that if a person owns 100 acres and must give the houses on 20 of them away at a cheaper price, the price of the houses on the other 80 acres will increase because the landowner or developer will not carry the 20% on his or her shoulders.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of qualification for a mortgage, in terms of the 35% eligibility test, it is defined as a loan for 90% of the price of the dwelling. Therefore, it is a vicious circle. This will increase house prices and as a result more people in the Dublin region will be shoved into the category of qualifying for affordable housing because they cannot get housing anywhere else. That means there will be a need for more land for affordable housing. In the meantime, the people who are in the 80% bracket and who are getting mortgages from building societies or banks will pay more for their houses. They will need bigger loans and this will cause untold damage in terms of stress and both partners having to work for the rest of their lives even though they may not want to do so. This is the reality of life and it all boils down to the fact that we have not provided the infrastructure which will enable people to live within 30 or 40 miles of this city or to work in other cities which should be developed. People should be able to live in a decent environment without choking Dublin city further with ever-increasing developments, fewer open spaces and higher density.</P>
    <P>Until we face up to this, the position in Dublin will be critical. If I leave my home ten miles away at 7.45 a.m. or 8 a.m., I would not reach Leinster House until 9.15 a.m. That is an hour and a half in choked traffic. The situation is such that in order to purchase a house young people are being forced to move to Greystones, for example, and the distance they must travel to work is longer. Although the extension of the DART to Greystones will be welcomed by many people, by the time a person tries to get on board at Bray, Dalkey or Glenageary the carriages will be full. The time spent travelling from places such as Greystones to Dublin city in the morning would be anything from an hour and a half to two hours on a bad morning and one must face the same delays going home in the evening. If there were properly developed towns and cities with infrastructure and serviced land, one could commute from or live and conduct business in these new cities and <Col N="1159" /> towns rather than have young people in the future face such poor quality of life.</P>
    <P>It is a total waste of time to have the Minister sitting here because he does not listen to a word, but some day perhaps someone might wish to read the record. I am just outlining my practical experience over 26 years in public life.</P>

      <P>I have not seen the Minister out that way yet but if he does come out, I will be only too pleased to introduce him to many young people who are facing a serious problem because they cannot get a house from a local authority, <Col N="1160" /> they cannot purchase a house and they have no prospect of getting a house in the future. My job as a Member of the Dáil is to bring forward solutions which I think might work, regardless of whether the Minister likes them. I am not following the line of any vested interest group, I am expressing the views of people who are deeply concerned for themselves, their children and their grandchildren. It is as simple as that. There is no point in including provisions in a Bill which, as I said at the outset, contains many good provisions but which will not work in a place like Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council or Dublin Corporation &ndash; together they represent about one third of the population. All I am saying is that this might work in Meath or Laois but it will not work in Dublin. There are structures in place which are making matters worse because public transport does not cater for the existing problems. In 1997 one of my daughters bought a house between Bray and Greystones where there is no public transport system. She paid £87,000 for a three bedroom semi-detached house off the plans in a new housing estate. By the time she moved into it in February 1998, the same house cost £110,000. Today, two years later, it costs £150,000 to £160,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister is asking the local authority which serves my area to draw up a housing strategy and to incorporate it into a development plan to provide for the needs of the people of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council, but it does not have the land to do so without rezoning all of the Dublin Mountains. That, in itself, will affect the quality of life of everybody in the greater Dublin region, in Wicklow and, indeed, throughout the country. That is not a line from any lobby group.</P>
      <P>This is a housing authority with 2,000 people on the housing list but it does not have the houses or the land on which to build houses. We keep pretending that each local authority will be a housing authority but they cannot if they do not have the land or the houses to house the people for whom they are responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am offering the Minister an alternative view. He may not agree with me but that is democracy. I accept the Minister is in the hot seat at the moment but my job is to say what I think. I am not here to speak for anybody but to say what I think is needed to solve the problems of the future. There is no point pretending we will wake up tomorrow morning to find God has made more land in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council area or in the area controlled by Dublin Corporation because that will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person wants a local authority house because they cannot afford to buy one, they will go to the Dublin Corporation or Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown housing department which will hand them a form to fill in. They will then go on a housing list and will wait on it for <Col N="1161" /> the next ten to 15 years unless we do something about it.</P>
    <P>We cannot deal with planning in isolation. If we are to develop new towns, we must develop them commercially as well, so people will have work. If they do not have work, they will commute. If they are going to commute, we must provide some type of transport, either by building more roads or by providing public transport. I am not knocking everything in the Bill but its provisions, which will be enacted, will do nothing for the people who face a huge problem in the Dublin area and who will face a greater one in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the Planning and Development Bill in terms of what it will do to regulate planning and development over the next ten to 15 years. The speed at which the economy has grown in the past five to six years highlights the need to update planning and development more regularly than has been the case to date. There have not been too many planning Bills since 1963 when the original master planning Act was introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This matter refers to a parliamentary question and the reply to it in respect of a case I dealt with before. The person concerned is a constituent of mine who has had a dispute with the Office of Public Works. I dealt with the case briefly in the past but that was five or six years ago and I expected it would have been resolved by now. The Minister is fair minded, as I would expect, but I am a little apprehensive about the manner and method used to deal with my constituent in this situation. I was not happy when I examined the file previously and am still not happy.</P>
      <P>I was particularly unhappy with the reply I received to Parliamentary Question No. 346 on 26 January. I asked the Minister for Finance, the progress, if any, in respect of a dispute regarding lands at Ballybride Road, Shankill, County Dublin, in view of the fact that this dispute has been ongoing for several years and asked him to make a statement on the matter. He replied that settlement terms had been put to the other party in the dispute but they had not responded.</P>
      <P>I then received correspondence from the constituent in question which stated that, further to my letter of the 24th and our subsequent telephone conversation on the lands at Ballybride Road, Shankill, County Dublin, the Office of Public Works had made no settlement terms to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> I tabled a further parliamentary question and was able to extract the following information.</P>
    <P>The dispute relates to a deposit paid to the Commissioner of Public Works in 1994 by the prospective purchaser of the lands in question. The prospective purchaser failed to complete the purchase and his deposit was forfeited in accordance with the terms of the contract which he signed. An offer of settlement was communicated by the Chief State Solicitor on behalf of the Commissioner of Public Works in March 1999 to solicitors acting for the proposed purchaser. The terms of the offer are confidential to the parties.</P>
    <P>I am as far ahead as I was to start with. I do not want to have to seek information under the Freedom of Information Act but I will go down that route if necessary. I am a great believer in fair play and am not accusing the Office of Public Works of being unfair but I am a little concerned when a large amorphous body is dealing with an individual. It very often will have the upper hand and will use it unwittingly to the detriment of the rights of the other side. Will the Minister of State check the file to ascertain if he is happy with the position? When I checked it I was not happy about it. I can get all the information I want if I submit an FOI query on it, although it might take 30 to 40 days to get the information. I would do that willingly, but it should not be necessary. As Members of this House, we should be able to resolve a matter as simple as this one.</P>
    <P>I am annoyed the reply to my parliamentary question was not accurate. The Minister of State will have to take up that with his Department. The reply should have been accurate and straightforward. A reply to a subsequent parliamentary question elucidates further on the matter. My constituent is not aware of the terms referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for being a minute or two late. Deputy Durkan has raised an important matter and I appreciate the way he has dealt with it in the House.</P>
      <P>The two parliamentary questions to which the Deputy referred relate to lands at Ballybride Road, Shankill, County Dublin. Parliamentary Question No. 346 of 26 January 2000 sought information on a dispute in relation to the lands. The reply stated that an offer of settlement had been made to the other party in the dispute and that a response had not been received thereto.</P>
      <P>Parliamentary Question No. 345 of 8 February 2000 sought details of the settlement terms referred to in that reply, indicating that the party involved was unaware of any such offer. The reply to this question outlined briefly the background to the dispute in respect of which the settlement offer had been made. The reply explained that the offer had been made by the Chief State Solicitor's office to the solicitors acting for the other party in March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that if the first reply <Col N="1163" /> had contained specific information as to who had made the offer, there would not have been a need for the Deputy to table a second parliamentary question. However, I am satisfied the latter reply merely expands on and is not in conflict with the initial reply. I accept the veracity of the Deputy's point in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate for me to deal with judicial matters. As this matter is the subject of legal proceedings, I am reluctant to say anything more about it at this stage. I do not like to have to resort to dealing with matters such as this in a legal framework. I would prefer if both parties, the Office of Public Works and the individual involved, could have settled the matter but that did not prove possible.</P>
    <P>I am assured the Chief State Solicitor's office, which acts on behalf of many Departments in legal matters and in this case acted on behalf of the Office of Public Works, made an offer, which it thought would have been accepted and which I think would have resolved the matter with the other party. We have not had a response from the individual's solicitors to the Chief State Solicitor's office on that point. It would be extremely helpful if there was some communication on that position.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy it is not the ambition of the Office of Public Works to use its power in a way that would be unfair to an individual in respect of any matter. My Department must be conscious of legal binding positions in dealing with this matter. An offer was made through the Chief State Solicitors' office to which there was not a reply. If there was a reply or some indication on the basis of that offer, with willingness on both sides, we may be able to reach a satisfactory solution in this matter.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Men's Health Issues.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Southern Health Board, I put forward a motion last week proposing an increased need to promote men's health issues in a manner similar to the way issues relating specifically to women's health have been highlighted in recent publications, such as A Plan for Women's Health.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out to me and I agreed with the point that this is a nationwide issue as well as one that is relevant to the Southern Health Board. I ask the Minister to ensure a clear strategy is formulated aimed at educating men on the health risks they are likely to face throughout their lives. Such a strategy may necessitate significant funding, research and targeting to maximise its effectiveness in highlighting male health issues to the common man but it is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was astonished by the response I received to my motion, particularly from the medical profession. I received letter after letter and a number of telephone calls informing me that a drive to raise awareness of the many health threats facing <Col N="1164" /> men is long overdue. I accept there are a number of strategies in place to promote healthier living and diet for everybody, and I commend the Minister on his stance on the anti-smoking campaign. However, there are certain health risks and threats that are specific to men and because of our physical make up and the pressures of today's society we must face them. The same applies to women. To address that, women's groups have focused people's minds effectively on issues that affect them.</P>
    <P>In the short time available I cannot go through all male health problems in detail nor am I not medically qualified to do so. I would like to point out a number of obvious and not so obvious areas where we do not seem to take men's health seriously. In the area of cancer, testicular and prostrate cancers are the cause of a significant percentage of male cancer deaths each year in Ireland, yet men, by and large, do not even know what to look for or would not dream of having a check up to catch this killer disease in its infancy when it can be dealt with easily. That attitude can be compared to that of women, many of whom go to their local GP on a routine basis for a screen test for breast cancer or a smear test.</P>
    <P>The area of heart disease is one that is almost solely relevant to men. Men must be made more aware of high cholesterol levels in diet that can lead to heart problems. A stroke is another risk area that tends to affect more men than women. Why is that the case and why are we not warning men of that? </P>
    <P>Depression, pressures and emotional problems affect young men and women. However, both sexes express their difficulties in different ways. I understand that eight or nine out of every ten young people who tragically decide to take their own lives are young men. For many, this is a cry for help that just got out of control, but suicide is becoming more and more common in our prosperous, new, fast-moving society.</P>
    <P>Young men are more likely to participate in risk taking behaviour such as drug and substance abuse in many cases with tragic consequences. I was not aware until recently that eating disorders are far from exclusive to girls and young women. A doctor has tried to convince me that they are as common for boys as they are for girls. Yet I am not aware of any programme in boys' schools to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to over-dramatise this point. I think the Minister of State is getting the message. The reason for the lack of publicity around men's health issues is straightforward. Men hate to talk about their health or issues they consider private because of the semi-macho barrier. Men certainly do not view the doctor as someone they should visit often unless they are at death's door. I consider myself a typical example of someone who has not been to a GP for years and I would certainly not consider going for a mere check up.</P>
    <P>In the UK, interestingly, 40% of men said that they would not attend their GP unless instructed <Col N="1165" /> to do so by their partner. This figure speaks for itself and the number might be even higher in Ireland. Women live an average of ten to 15 years longer than their male counterparts in modern Ireland. We should ask why that is the case and decide on the action we should take.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take this motion seriously and to instruct a person or a team in his Department to undertake a national study and promote a campaign to change men's old fashioned attitudes towards their health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for raising the issue of men's health. I need not inform him that the provision of health services is not organised on a gender specific basis. However, as he correctly pointed out, there are illnesses which are specific to men, such as prostate cancer and testicular cancer, in the same way as there are illnesses specific to women, such as breast cancer and cervical cancer. It took many years for women to become aware of the need for screening and testing and I accept fully Deputy Coveney's point about the need for awareness among men. The Deputy referred to the policy on women's health, as set out in the women's health plan, which seeks to ensure that women can have access to appropriate services in a &ldquo;women friendly&rdquo; environment. However, the women's health plan does not call for the development of separate services for women.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to develop a men's health plan. However, there has been some debate at health board level recently about identifying areas that are of particular interest to men. There have been a number of significant policy developments of late which will allow us to better identify health issues that affect men in particular and to target interventions at men.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Health and Children recently commissioned a national lifestyle survey which was carried out by the National University of Ireland, Galway. This major national survey involving over 13,000 randomly selected individuals throughout the country will allow us, for the first time, to look at lifestyle practices that affect health by gender, age and social class. The results of this survey, which were published last year, indicate that there are specific problems in relation to men in a range of areas, particularly in terms of certain individuals being overweight or obese. Deputy Coveney also drew our attention to a number of other areas.</P>
      <P>Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for an unacceptably high proportion of premature deaths among men in Ireland. In fact, our premature morbidity and mortality rates for men from heart disease are among the worst in Europe. The recently published cardiovascular strategy &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo; proposes an extensive range of interventions across the full spectrum of health care aimed at reducing the rates of premature illness and death from this largely preventable condition during the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> In health promotion terms the aim is to raise awareness in relation to a number of issues, including those relating to men's health among many others. The public awareness campaigns, on issues such as smoking, exercise, alcohol, nutrition, etc., which are run by the health promotion unit of the Department are of benefit to both men and women.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently finalising the drafting of a new health promotion strategy which will, among other things, identify key population groups and set out an action plan aimed at improving their health and well-being. Men have been identified in the draft strategy document as one such key group and I look forward to being in a position to introduce new initiatives in this in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter which concerns the seriously inadequate nature of emergency services in the Dublin region. In 1985 there were 35,000 ambulance call-outs in Dublin. A complement of 14 ambulances, 11 of these were fire brigade units and three were Eastern Health Board units, were available to deal with these emergencies. Only 15 years later the number of call-outs has soared to 90,000, an increase of well over 150%. The number of ambulances expected to cope with this level of demand, however, stands at 16, a mere increase of two since 1985.</P>
      <P>I am gravely concerned about this situation. Each of the 90,000 call-outs made last year could have involved matters of life and death, many of them certainly did so. It is essential that in a growing city such as Dublin our emergency services are given the resources necessary to provide a rapid and effective service. The failure to increase the Dublin ambulance fleet in order to allow it to cope with the massive recent growth in demand must be addressed urgently, before we are obliged to debate this matter following the occurrence of a preventable tragedy.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. Last year we witnessed the appalling situation where a large proportion of the Dublin ambulance fleet was detained in hospitals across the city and could not respond to emergency calls because patients had to be kept on ambulance stretchers. Ambulance crews were obliged to wait for hours before stretchers were returned which allowed them to respond to calls again. These problems are ongoing.</P>
      <P>In addition to the size of the ambulance fleet, there are a number of other factors which affect the ability of the ambulance services to respond quickly to emergency calls. For example, the escalating traffic gridlock in Dublin city and its suburbs has significantly increased travel times for ambulances. Serious traffic jams make the city centre virtually impassable for hours each day. Ambulances are affected in common with other vehicles in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> The ongoing crisis in our hospitals is also severely affecting the operation of our emergency services. Transfer times &ndash; the time it takes for an ambulance unit to have a patient admitted to hospital and be available again for another call-out &ndash; have increased substantially due to the deteriorating situation in accident and emergency wards in hospitals across the city. The lack of emergency beds and the lack of trolleys for patients means that they are obliged to remain on ambulance stretchers in accident and emergency units. Ambulance crews must wait, sometimes for several hours, before their equipment is returned allowing them to respond to emergency calls again. On several occasions in recent months, there were no ambulances available to respond to emergency calls. Fire brigade units were sent out to deal with those cases and to wait with patients until an ambulance became available.</P>
    <P>The age of many emergency service vehicles is a matter of concern. Approximately 70% of fire brigade units are over ten years old. Out of 47 fire brigade units, 14 were purchased over 15 years ago and they remain in service. Many of our fire brigade units were purchased second-hand from local authorities in the UK which were replacing their fleets and wished to remove old vehicles from service. Many of these units end up forming the backbone of the Dublin fleet. An innovative scrappage scheme to remove old and unreliable cars from our roads was introduced in recent years. Does the Minister not find it ironic that the composition of our emergency vehicle fleet operates on the opposite basis?</P>
    <P>The condition and effectiveness of the emergency services in Dublin is an issue which must be tackled now. It is abundantly clear that the necessary resources to provide a high-level, dependable service have not been invested for many years. However, the remarkable turnaround in Exchequer finances leaves the Government with no excuse. An expanded emergency fleet of ambulances and new fire brigade units are urgently required in Dublin. The staff of our emergency services have performed sterling work in the face of enormous odds during the past decade. It is imperative that the Government demonstrates its commitment to these services by providing significant new funding to Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board to expand and replace the existing fleet.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to give a commitment that this investment will be made before we are obliged to debate this issue after an avoidable tragedy has occurred in our capital city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to avail of the opportunity provided by the Deputy to discuss the performance of the ambulance service in the Dublin area and to outline the significant developments taking place to further enhance this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that the ambulance service responds effectively to the need of the public and the House will be interested to know that a <Col N="1168" /> value for money report on the emergency service carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General revealed that the ambulance service in the Eastern Health Board region responded to 97% of all emergency calls within 20 minutes of receipt. This response time was acknowledged as being the fastest response time of the eight health board regions. In the context of this performance, it is appropriate to take this opportunity to pay tribute to those in the ambulance service who work so hard to maintain these standards of response and provide life-saving care in circumstances which can often be difficult and unpleasant.</P>
    <P>The provision of ambulance services in the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board. The emergency ambulance service in Dublin operates from 15 locations throughout the city. Dublin Corporation provides this service on behalf of the Eastern Health Board from 11 of these locations.</P>
    <P>The identification of priorities for the development of the ambulance service in Dublin is a matter for the Eastern Health Board, in the first instance, and it is the Department's policy to respond to these priorities within the framework of policy on the development of pre-hospital and ambulance services as set out in the report of the review group on the ambulance service and cardiovascular health strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to providing the resources needed for the development of this vital service and the funding that is being provided for the ambulance service nationally in 2000 brings to more than £33 million the total resources provided since the report of the review group was published. Well more than half of that £33 million investment has taken place under this Government. Nationally, this investment has resulted in a range of important improvements to the ambulance service with new command and control centres being developed, the availability of a cardiac ambulance service expanded and equipment upgraded. The ambulance service in the Dublin area has benefited considerably from this investment in a number of important areas: a programme of training, including the use of defibrillators in the treatment of cardiac emergencies, is being implemented in respect of all providers of pre-hospital care, including those employed by Dublin Fire Brigade; ambulance resources based in Swords, Tallaght and Maynooth have been expanded; investment in the ambulance fleet has increased and improved fleet management and replacement arrangements for ambulance vehicles have been put in place; and a new command and control centre shared by the Eastern Health Board and Dublin Fire Brigade has been brought into service.</P>
    <P>These developments further enhance the capacity of the ambulance service in the Dublin area to provide a responsive and effective emergency service which meets the growing needs of the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> The Government has pursued a policy of investment aimed at improving key aspects of the service including training, equipment, vehicles and communications. The Minister is committed to the further development of this vital service in the context of the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy and in response to the priorities identified by health boards. The Minister will, therefore, continue to provide additional resources for the development of the ambulance service in Dublin to ensure that those calling on the ambulance service continue to receive timely and appropriate care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Hanafin on her appointment as Minister of State and wish her well, but I am disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is not in the House. The traffic to Caherciveen must be so bad that he got away early.</P>
      <P>The Minister's decision to arbitrarily increase Land Registry fees will add further financial pressure to home owners and potential buyers. This little known measure which the Minister invoked on 19 September 1999 will virtually double the costs associated in the purchasing or transferring of property in the housing market.</P>
      <P>The proposed fee increases will make a huge difference to the costs associated with purchasing a house to the average home buyer. Already the excessive costs in purchasing property, as seen in the punitive rate of stamp duty and the professional fees involved, are making it virtually impossible for people to purchase a home. The Minister's decision to increase Land Registry fees will make it more difficult for a first time buyer to enter the market. I would like to know from the Minister the reasons behind his decision to impose such a dramatic fee increase. It is worth pointing out that at no stage prior to signing these statutory instruments did the Minister consult the Law Society. Members of the profession were not made aware of the level of registration fee increases being sought or of the new heads of charge until after the fees order was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister should explain to the House his precise reasons for increasing these charges. Moreover, the imposition of a new set of charges which was part of the statutory instru<Col N="1170" /> ment signed last September, will further confuse and complicate an already dated system of conveyancing charges. Will the Minister confirm if the increases in the fees imposed will have a corresponding guarantee of increased staffing at the Land Registry office?</P>
    <P>It has been known for quite some time that the huge backlog at the Land Registry is placing considerable inconvenience on purchasers and their solicitors. For solicitors attempting to conclude various transactions, only one hour exists every working day, where they can liaise directly with members of staff at the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>There is no longer a maximum fee per transaction in place as a result of the Minister's statutory instrument. Previously this fee was £250 and the following example will highlight the inflationary nature of the Minister's proposals on house purchasers. A property costing more than £40,001 will attract a fee of £300, together with a further fee of £50 if a new folio is to be opened, and a fee of £100 if there is a mortgage. Therefore, the new transaction cost is £450.</P>
    <P>As the vast majority of acquisitions are well in excess of £40,000, it is logical to assume that all purchasers, and particularly those at the lower end of the fee scale, will pay a minimum of £450 for a transaction which currently costs £250. Neither the Land Registry nor the Minister can justify this increase of over £200 in the most basic transaction.</P>
    <P>While there are many other fee increases attached to the statutory instrument, one which should be exposed, is a new charge of £250 for approving a scheme map for new building estates. This charge will presumably be passed on to purchasers of new houses, together with a further additional charge of £500 or £1,000 should the scheme map have to be revised at a later date. It should be pointed out that the Land Registry does not enjoy semi-State status and is, in effect, an administrative arm of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister's right to increase fees, which have not been increased since 1991, should be understood in the context of the primary legislation which was enacted in 1964. That legislation precludes the Minister from increasing fees at the Land Registry in order to provide additional resources. Furthermore, in the most recent report from the Land Registry, it is quite clear that a significant operating profit exists and that such moneys have been siphoned off by the Department of Finance or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister is far from Caherciveen undertaking work within his remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will set out the background to the matters to which the Deputy is referring. The Minister has approved two new fees orders for the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. The Registry of Deeds fees order took effect from 1 February last and the Land Registry fees order will take <Col N="1171" /> effect from 1 May next. The orders give effect to a comprehensive review of the structure of the fees charged for the various services provided by the registries. They have been designed to provide a fair and balanced response to the changes which have taken place in the conveyancing and property markets since the previous orders were introduced in 1991.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Government has approved the conversion of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds to a commercial semi-State body. The necessary legislation is being prepared at present. The new fees structures which the Minister has approved for both registries is an essential element of the preparations for the conversion. The new organisation will be expected to operate in a commercial environment and it will be extremely important to ensure that the fees are set at the correct levels having regard to the costs of providing the services and the need to ensure that the new organisation is placed at the outset on a sound commercial and financial footing. There has in recent years been substantial investment in the registries infrastructure, in particular in the information technology area.</P>
    <P>The new fees orders are also intended to simplify the fee structure for users of the registries' services and reduce the instance of inequities in the old system. They reflect the registries objective of being responsive to the marketplace. One example of this is the introduction of a flat rate for the registration of mortgages. Uniquely, also, within the conveyancing chain, the registries operate on a fixed fee rather than a percentage basis. The new fee orders continue this approach.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, this is the first review of the fees charged since 1991 and in the circumstances the current fees orders are long overdue. The fees being charged have for some time, in many cases, represented only a fraction of the cost involved in providing the services. The revised orders represent a first but necessary step in addressing this situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to outline some of the features of the new fees structure contained in the orders. While the overall rate of increase varies, the cost of the most common dealing, the registration of a transfer of property valued at between £40,001 and £200,000, has been increased from £250 to £300. This is a 20% rise which is not unreasonable given the rate of inflation of approximately 18% since 1991.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that contrary to his belief there is a fixed fee per transaction in this new fees order. This has eliminated the more arbitrary <Col N="1172" /> nature of the present dealings based fees order. Compensation payments to registry clients are linked to the value of the property registered. For example, a property with a value of £1 million would generate a greater compensation payment were an error to be made in the registration of the title than a property with a value of £100,000. Yet the fee to the registry currently is the same, £250. This is an example of the inequity referred to earlier and the new fees order is structured in order to reduce such inequities while operating within reasonable parameters in relation to the maximum fees payable.</P>
    <P>In some instances fees are being reduced. For example, a flat fee of £100 is being introduced for the registration of charges as opposed to the situation previously where the fees were based on the amount of the mortgage. Fees for transfers are also being reduced. A transfer of £40,000 will now cost £200, a reduction of £50.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry currently offers a free service to builders and solicitors where a scheme or a multi-storey development is being carried out. This service is extremely time consuming and the proposed new fee will not compensate for the time involved. It goes some way, however, to recognising the amount of resources required in the registry, such as those highlighted by the Deputy, to service such dealings. Typically, a scheme map would contain anything from ten to 50 plus sites and it is estimated that the average cost per site will be from £1 to £25.</P>
    <P>In the Registry of Deeds general increases in line with inflation have been implemented. The main charge for the registration of a memorial is being increased from £26 to £35. The daily search fee of £10 per day has been eliminated and has been replaced by a £1 search fee per name per ten year period. This will reflect the actual usage of the service.</P>
    <P>I trust that the House will acknowledge that the new fees orders are both necessary and fair. They are being implemented following careful consideration and with the approval of the Minister and the interim board of the land registries whose function it is to advise the Minister regarding the smooth transition of the registries to commercial semi-State status. As regards the Deputy's comments on the effect of these revised fees on the costs associated with purchasing property, any reasonable examination of the facts will reveal that the effect on the cost of the typical property will be negligible in comparison with the costs associated with the purchase and various other costs involved.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 February 2000.</P>

    <P>The costs for security at Magee Barracks have been borne by the Eastern Health Board since that property was handed over to accommodate Kosovan refugees on 12 May 1999. Castleblayney military barracks was transferred to the North-Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and no further security costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to that property.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks will not be vacated until later this year and therefore no private security costs have arisen at that location.</P>
    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty allowances alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to more than £450,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £72,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 21, 23 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The society is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body the central council. I am also mindful that a fundamental principle of <Col N="1175" /> the International Committee of the Red Cross is that all Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies enjoy freedom from political involvement worldwide. My Department, as in the past, is available to provide help and assistance to the society as and when requested.</P>
    <P>Following the appointment of a new secretary general to the Irish Red Cross Society in 1999, one of the first tasks he undertook was a strategic review of the operation of the society. I am informed that the strategic review will encompass the views and opinions of all organs of the society to ensure the strengthening and development of the society. I understand this review will be inclusive, involving volunteers and all staff members. The Red Cross is being assisted by a consultant in these matters. It is intended that the review will be completed by mid-2000. It may transpire that legislative changes may be required at that time and my Department will respond as required in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the problems being experienced currently in the society will be addressed adequately within the terms of the strategic review. As I have previously indicated I have no function in the day-to-day administration of the Red Cross Society.</P>

      <P>Enhancement of Ireland's fishery protection capability is being supported by a five year EU financial aid package for fisheries surveillance, running from 1996 to 2000. Under the package, Ireland has been receiving financial support for a significant programme of investment in fisheries surveillance equipment. The new naval service fishery protection vessel, the <i>LE Róisín</i>, has been the principal project to receive funding under the programme. This vessel was commissioned on 15 December 1999 and became operational immediately afterwards. To date a total of £7.6 million has been received in EU funding towards the cost of the <i>LE Róisín</i> and it is anticipated that a further £1.9 million will be received.</P>
      <P>Consideration is being given to the question of the purchase of another Naval Service fishery protection vessel similar to the <i>LE Róisín</i> as a replacement for the <i>LE Deirdre</i> which has completed almost 28 years in service. The position regarding EU contribution towards the cost of this vessel remains to be clarified.</P>
      <P>To date, there has been no notification from the EU, regarding a successor to the current financial aid package for fisheries surveillance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces have been deployed for service with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) since 1978. Six hundred Defence Forces personnel are currently serving with the Irish contingent UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my most sincere sympathy and that of my colleagues in Government to the families and relatives of Privates Lawlor, Fitzpatrick, Murphy and Deere who so tragically lost their lives on Monday morning in a traffic accident while serving with the 86th Irish Battalion in Lebanon. I would also like to express sympathy to the other Defence Forces personnel who were injured in the accident and to wish them a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>The UNIFIL mandate is reviewed by the United Nations Security Council every six months following a report by the secretary general of the United Nations. UN Security Council Resolution 1288 of 31 January 2000 has extended the mandate of UNIFIL for a further period of six months, i.e. until 31 July 2000.</P>
      <P>On 12 October 1999 the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL comprising approximately 620 personnel all ranks for a six month period beginning 20 October 1999. The Government decision also allowed for preparations to be made for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent of approximately 620 personnel all ranks to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in the UNIFIL peace-keeping force beyond January 2000 in the event of the further extension of the UNIFIL mandate. The approval of Government will be sought soon in relation to the continuation of participation by the Irish contingent in UNIFIL from April 2000, when the current contingent will be due to return home.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Middle East peace process, I note with regret that the negotiation to conclude a framework agreement on permanent status issues have not been completed by the target date of 13 February. I also view with concern the escalation of violence in the region. I hope that the parties will resume negotiations on the permanent status talks without delay.</P>
      <P>The level of their casualties in Lebanon led the Israeli Government to declare its intention to withdraw unilaterally from Lebanon if no agreement is reached with Syria. This could be as early as April. A disorderly Israeli withdrawal without the agreement of the Lebanese and Syrian governments could create difficulties for the UNIFIL contingent in Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, the position of the Israeli backed South Lebanese Army after any Israeli withdrawal remains to be clarified. This scenario could call <Col N="1177" /> for the possibility of a revision of the role of UNIFIL for a post-withdrawal situation.</P>
    <P>Developments in the coming months may give a clearer indication as to what role UNIFIL would have after the re-establishment of Lebanese sovereignty over its territory. In this regard indications are that the Lebanese authorities would seek a reinforcement of UNIFIL until such time as its function could be undertaken by the Lebanese army.</P>
    <P>I visited the area from 20-22 June 1999 to seek assurances from both the Israeli and Lebanese sides that the reckless shelling of IRISHBATT positions by the Israeli Defence Force/De Facto Forces (IDF/DFF) which led to the death of Private Kedian in May 1999 would not recur. I indicated to both sides that, while Ireland is committed to the UNIFIL mission, should there not be a cessation of such incidents, serious consideration would have to be given by the Government to the withdrawal of the Irish contingent.</P>
    <P>While there have been no major incidents in recent months the security situation in the UNIFIL area of operations continues to be relatively tense. I visited UNIFIL again from 20-24 September 1999 and found the situation to be calmer than in the earlier part of the year.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to alter the present level of Defence Forces commitment to UNIFIL.</P>

      <Col N="1178" /> The levels of remuneration applied to volunteer reservists are the same <i>pro rata</i> as those applied to their rank counterparts in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The future development of the FCÁ and An Slua Muirí will be based on the framework of the recommendations of the ministerial steering group established in 1998. Following upon a comprehensive military board review of the RDF, the steering group reported in September 1999. That report will be published in due course in order to facilitate further wide ranging consultations which will feed into the drafting of a formal implementation plan. The full implementation of the recommendations would probably take about six years.</P>
    <P>The steering group were particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The present policy of ongoing recruitment for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address the question of any shortfalls in personnel numbers in the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service and the Air Corps. In January 1999, some 20 general service Army recruits were assigned to the Air Corps. In 1999, a total of 97 general service recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service under the general recruitment campaign. A further recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces in respect of the year 2000 will be launched and advertised shortly.</P>
      <P>A special general service recruitment campaign, specifically for the Naval Service, was launched in September 1999 and was successful in attracting some 45 recruits. In addition, 17 apprentices and four radio radar technicians were enlisted in 1999 for the Naval Service. A number of personnel have transferred from the Air Corps to take up radio radar technician appointments in the Naval Service. In September 1999, three Naval Service cadets were commissioned. At the end of September 1999, eight new Naval Service cadets were enlisted and they are currently in training in the cadet school, Naval Base, Haulbowline. The cadet competition for year 2000 was only recently advertised and has again elicited a good public response. This competition will provide another intake of cadets for both the Naval Service and the Air Corps this autumn.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, 15 avionics apprentices commenced training with the Air Corps. In July 1999, seven Air Corps cadets were commissioned as pilots and in September 1999 a further 13 new Air Corps cadets were enlisted and they are currently in training in the Cadet School, Defence Force Training Centre. They are due return to Baldonnel in June 2000 to commence basic flight training. An earlier class of 11 Air Corps cadets are already undergoing flight training at Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>Two non-commissioned personnel were commissioned as Naval Service electrical engineer officers in November last. A direct entry competition for Naval Service watchkeeping officers was advertised recently and interviews have commenced. Proposals for a direct entry competition for marine engineer officers later this year are under consideration at present. Vacancies which have arisen at non-commissioned rank are being filled internally by promotion and vacancies created in the lower ranks consequent on these promotions are being filled by the ongoing recruitment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, the Naval Service sought applications from eligible non-commissioned Naval Service personnel who wished to be considered for participation in a potential watchkeeping officers course this year. On successful completion of this course, participating personnel will be appointed as commissioned officers in the <Col N="1180" /> Naval Service to fill appointments as watchkeeping officers.</P>
    <P>The precise crewing level for the new vessel <i>LE Róisín</i> has not yet been decided. In order to assess the crewing level required for the new vessel, full regard will be paid to and full advantage extracted from the new technology incorporated in the vessel, given what it offers in terms of automation and labour savings. This process of assessment is being undertaken now that the vessel has been delivered and the Naval Service has an opportunity to train personnel in its operation. However, the crew for the new vessel will be met from the overall authorised strength of the Naval Service of 1144.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Coast Guard of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of a marine search and rescue service in this country. The Air Corps provides a search and rescue service from Finner, County Donegal, and Waterford Regional Airport as part of the overall search and rescue arrangements. Bond Helicopters provide a search and rescue service, using medium lift helicopters, from Shannon and Dublin Airports under contract to the Irish Coast Guard. The service operating from Dublin Airport commenced on 1 July 1998, prior to which the Air Corps provided search and rescue coverage on the east coast. It had been intended that the new service would be crewed by Air Corps personnel and would operate from Casement Aerodrome once certain legal difficulties concerning the question of the basing of a civil operation at a military airbase had been resolved. This latter element is being pursued with the Department of Public Enterprise and the Irish Aviation Authority. The high incidence of retirement of Air Corps flying officers in recent years meant that the Air Corps was not in a position to provide pilots for the new service. Provision was, however, made in the contract with the operator for the introduction of Air Corps crew at a future date. The new service is currently operating from Dublin Airport with the option of re-locating to Baldonnel at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All aircraft in the Air Corps fleet undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to ensure that they are fully airworthy and meet the certification standards laid down for the aviation industry. The future equipment requirements for the Air Corps and response thereto will be dealt with in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Defence. The purchase of a significant number of capital assets such as new helicopters would require cons iderasble investment of State funds to finance the initial acquisition and the ongoing maintenance regimes which must be followed to ensure the fullest level of operational safety. Pursuing the objective of best use of financial resources I must be satisfied that whatever procurement programme is embarked upon will be an integrated response to the real and realistic needs of the Air Corps and the Defence Forces overall in fulfilling their roles and tasks in the new organisation. In the meantime I recently established a civil-military board to examine urgently a number of issues in relation to Air <Col N="1182" /> Corps equipment particularly in the context of flying training and the operation of the Search and Rescue service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The 1998 Price Waterhouse report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service set out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. Some of these recommendations could be proceeded with fairly quickly while others would take longer to implement. It is important that the recommendations be implemented in a structured and coherent way that contributes to the overall development of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I have always emphasised the importance of involving all of the relevant stakeholders in the process. Accordingly, I have established a special consultation group to provide a forum for the input of the key stakeholders in relation to the State aid and sea services. This consultation group, which I chair, comprises representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department, from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. To date the group has held an initial meeting at which I invited stakeholders to make their inputs to the process and appropriate contacts have been made at official level to facilitate this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1998, I directed the chief of staff to arrange for the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans that would give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. Draft implementation plans for both services were submitted to me late last year. After careful consideration of both plans, I decided that additional work needed to be done to augment the draft implementation plan for the Naval Service. I am currently awaiting a revised draft plan from the chief of staff before I can advance the process. Once this plan has been received, the consultative group's principal work will begin. Further meetings of the group will <Col N="1183" /> occur as the planning and implementation process develops.</P>
    <P>As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The broader development of both services has been dealt with in the context of the White Paper on Defence which presents a positive opportunity to develop the Defence Forces for the long-term. I will bring my proposals on the White Paper to Government very shortly.</P>
    <P>Investment in both services has of course continued during the White Paper process and considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote on weapons, ammunition, transport, communications and equipment for the Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Accommodation requirements at Casement Aerodrome are the subject of ongoing review, particularly in the light of the need to cater for personnel in the Air Corps headquarters and at Gormanston who are due to relocate to Casement. Contracts amounting to £3.4 million have been completed at Casement Aerodrome since 1996 and projects with an estimated final cost of over £5 million commenced in 1999. These include further hangar refurbishment; upgrading of the refuelling installation and a new Garda Air Support Unit building which will be shared by the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>About £22.5 million was spent on Naval Service equipment in 1999 including approx. £10 million in respect of the new fishery protection vessel <i>LE Róisín</i>. This new vessel which was commissioned into the Naval Service on the 15 December 1999 became operational immediately thereafter and cost in the region of £22.5 million. The White Paper includes a commitment to the purchase of another fishery protection vessel similar to the <i>LE Róisín</i> as a replacement for the <i>LE Deirdre</i> which has been in service for nearly thirty years and is approaching the end of its economic service life. The contract for the purchase of the <i>LE Róisín</i> included an option, which is still available, to purchase a second ship of the same type at a similar price.  Construction time for such a vessel would be in the region of 16 to 18 months.</P>

      <P>Financial agreements have been reached in relation to the disposal of Castleblayney and Fermoy Barracks and the legal formalities require to be completed. The receipt of income will follow completion of the sales agreements. Plans for the disposal of the remaining barracks at Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare and Clancy are at an advanced stage and it is hoped to have these sales completed during 2000. It is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sale of the six barracks identified for disposal and I will be seeking to ensure that the proceeds will be re-invested in full in the Defence Forces.  </P>
      <P>A special barrack re-investment building programme has been commenced and expenditure in 1999 in this area amounted to about £2.5 million. Expenditure for 2000 is estimated at £13 million and for 2001 at £27 million.</P>

      <P>Since January 2000 there have been 29 firings close to Irish positions. The safety of Irish personnel serving overseas is always of paramount concern to me and to the Government. While absolute guarantees cannot be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions such as UNIFIL, it is my policy to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. Each post within the Irish UNIFIL area of operations has reinforced concrete bunkers specifically designed to withstand direct and indirect fire from heavy weapons. Rigorous operational procedures are in place to ensure that personnel occupy these bunkers in a timely fashion should the need arise. In such eventuality, minimum duty personnel remain in place, protected, to ensure that operational activity is observed and reported.</P>
      <P>Physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is continually being improved. Irish troops are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the House on 11 November 1998, during the course of my visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 14/17 October 1998, I signed, on behalf of the Government, a memorandum of understanding which commits Ireland to the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS.</P>
      <P>UNSAS gives the UN a precise understanding of the forces and other capabilities that Ireland would have available at a given state of readiness for UN peace support operations. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.</P>
      <P>The total number of personnel currently serving abroad is 869. This short-term excess over the agreed maximum commitment under UNSAS arose from the Government's desire to respond to the very difficult situation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Requests for personnel of the Defence Forces to serve on overseas missions are considered on their merits in the prevailing circumstances within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS. Among the factors taken into account when considering the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas are security considerations at home and the level of existing overseas commitments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the three year period 1996 to 1998 a total of about 1,500 personnel availed of a voluntary early retirement scheme at a cost of £65 million in lump sums and pensions. From 1999 onwards, net pay savings arising from the reduction in numbers began to accrue. These savings are estimated at £15 million in 1999 and at £15.4 million in 2000. It was agreed that half of these ongoing pay savings would be retained in the Defence Vote for investment in equipment and infrastructure and that the other half of the savings would go to the exchequer in order, <Col N="1186" /> among other things, to repay the initial cost of the VER scheme.</P>
    <P>The pay savings allocated to the Defence Vote arising from the VER scheme will fund the purchase of 40 armoured personnel carriers over the next few years.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. At any given time there would generally be about half of these vessels on patrol. The new patrol vessel, the <i>LE Roisín,</i> was commissioned on 15 December, 1999 and became operational immediately afterwards. Consideration is also being given to the question of the purchase of another patrol vessel similar to the <i>LE Roisín</i> as a replacement for the <i>LE Deirdre,</i> which has completed almost 28 years in service.</P>
      <P>The present policy of ongoing recruitment for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address the question of any shortfalls in personnel numbers in the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service and the Air Corps.

      <Col N="1188" /> The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two Casa maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
    <P>Patrols range in duration from a few days to five or six weeks. The number of patrols undertaken by each vessel in each of the years from 1997 to 1999 is as follows:&ndash;</P>

    <P>My Department does not maintain a comprehensive record of the numbers of civilian and military personnel employed in other countries. Overall, however, the proportion of civilians employed in Ireland appears low compared with many other countries. For example, in the UK and American <Col N="1189" /> Defence organisations around one third of those employed are civilians. In Denmark, there are around 9,000 civilians and 29,000 military personnel.</P>
    <P>Comparisons are complicated by differences in Government systems, job definitions and the different job descriptions employed in different countries. Much of the work undertaken by the Department of Defence in Ireland such as pensions administration, payroll payments, Civil Defence would be undertaken by other agencies in other countries.</P>
    <P>The degree of civilianisation in Ireland appears generally modest compared with other countries.</P>

    <P>On the basis of its Presentation Document Ireland will develop, in consultation with the NATO Secretariat, an Individual Partnership Programme which will cover a two year period initially and which will set out the level and extent of proposed participation in such areas as co-operation in peacekeeping principles, doctrine, training and exercises and inter-operability in peacekeeping operations. Arrangements are currently being put in place to advance the development of Ireland's individual partnership programme.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever operations they may be tasked with in line with Ireland's individual partnership programme for participation in PfP.</P>
    <P>Participation in a future NATO-PfP exercise such as BALTOPS will be considered should an invitation to participate be received in my Department. No such invitation has been received.</P>

      <P>On 3 February 2000, officials of my Department and of the Chief State Solicitor's office met with representatives of the Incorporated Law Society and of solicitors representing about half the litigants with hearing loss claims outstanding. A further meeting has been arranged. These discussions are, by agreement, confidential but, on a trial basis, a proposal to establish a mechanism to settle claims was made by my Department and a response is now awaited from the solicitors.</P>
      <P>The success or otherwise of this interim approach will determine my future actions in regard to the remaining claims. However, the Government has approved in principle the preparation of the heads of a Bill to provide for any statutory compensation scheme which may be required in the light of the outcome of the present proposal.</P>

      <P>In December 1999, 58 new cases were received and 30 new cases received in January 2000. A further 28 new cases were received in the first two weeks of this month.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>In seeking to ensure that the EU has the capabilities required for Petersberg Tasks, the Helsinki European Council made clear that this process is not about creating a European Army. The importance of civilian crisis management, including the civilian dimensions of conflict prevention, was also recognised by the Helsinki European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council agreed on a voluntary target for establishing the capabilities required for Petersberg Tasks. This target, which member states aim to meet by 2003, is to be able to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to be able to sustain this deployment for one year. This would equate roughly to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo. Consideration is also being given to the <Col N="1192" /> appropriate arrangements that would allow interested non-EU states to contribute to the Petersberg tasks, and also to the appropriate consultation arrangements to be worked out between the EU and NATO for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council, with the participation of the Defence Ministers, will develop a method of consultation through which this target can be met and maintained, and through which national contributions reflecting member states' political will and commitment toward this target can be defined by each member state, with a regular review of progress made. Participation by any member state will be on an entirely case by case basis as individual missions arise.</P>
    <P>The Presidency will present an interim progress report to the Lisbon European Council on 23-24 March, and a fuller progress report to the European Council in June.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times a number of approaches have been made by private concerns regarding the possible use of facilities at Baldonnel Aerodrome. My main concern, in examining these proposals, would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending <Col N="1193" /> usage of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may have implications regarding licensing of the facility for commercial use. However, the greater utilisation of this underused resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise in consultation with myself in the context of overall airports policy generally. In that regard the recent report to the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance on the future of Aer Rianta did consider the possibility of a second airport in the Dublin area and this was considered in the context of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
    <P>This report will help in assessing the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop. Following consideration of the report it is intended that the Minister for Public Enterprise and myself will report to Government with specific recommendations in regard to the future of Baldonnel. It would not be appropriate for me at this stage to speculate on what these recommendations will be.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Defence Act, 1954 makes provision for the Council of Defence which is chaired by the Minister for Defence and comprises the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, <Col N="1194" /> the secretary general of the Department, the Chief of Staff and the two Deputy Chiefs of Staff.</P>
    <P>The council's origins lie in the early years of the State. Its purpose at that time was to provide a structured forum for the provision of advice to the Minister. However, as the concerns of that era have faded into history, the council has quite naturally fallen into disuse. It has convened only once in the past 25 years. In the normal course of the business of the Department of Defence the Minister meets individually or jointly with his senior civil and military officials as part of ongoing administration, management and decision-making in relation to defence matters. These arrangements have meant that the Council of Defence has become redundant. That is why I will propose to Government that the council be abolished as part of the White Paper process.</P>
    <P>The management structures of the Department of Defence have changed substantially in recent years. In 1996, the Department's Strategic Management Committee was established. In 1998, the practice of having three senior officers reporting separately to the Minister came to an end when the Defence Act was amended to replace the appointments of adjutant general and quartermaster general by two deputy chief of staff appointments.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Management Committee provides an important forum for the discussion of all major policy issues. It is chaired by the Secretary General and its other members are the Chief of Staff, the two Deputy Chiefs of Staff and the two assistant secretaries of the Department. The general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service also attend in respect of items affecting their services.</P>
    <P>Under the draft White Paper, it is envisaged that the role of the SMC will be enhanced by means of a greater emphasis on strategic planning and on policy formulation and review.</P>
    <P>A more proactive role for the SMC will help to maintain a shared understanding of the policy objectives facing the Defence organisation with a view to ensuring that the Minister has the best possible advice available to him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>I last had formal meetings with RACO and PDFORRA on 19 August 1999 and 25 May 1999, respectively. Both associations have recently submitted requests for meetings with me. These meetings are arranged for next week. In addition I attended the delegate conferences of both associations late last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Defence in October 1997, I have had at least one formal meeting each year with representatives of both <Col N="1196" /> PDFORRA and RACO. These meetings are generally at the request of either association to deal with issues which are of concern to them.</P>
    <P>The conciliation and arbitration scheme provides a mechanism within which issues which come within the associations' remit can and should be addressed. While I am happy to meet with PDFORRA and RACO in any situation where the representative associations are involved I am anxious that the normal representative machinery would be used.</P>
    <P>Legislation establishing the Defence Forces representative associations which was passed by this House in 1990 takes cognisance of the special nature of the military organisation with its own ethos and responsibilities. Accordingly, the Defence Amendment Act, 1990, specifically excludes from the scope of representation &ldquo;any operation and the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces...&rdquo;. In the ten years since the enactment of this legislation and the establishment of representative associations I have not become aware of any compelling reason, in either the use of the representative process by the associations or in terms of its effectiveness, to propose an amendment to the legislation, nor have any proposals to do so been made to me. It is incumbent on all parties to the representative process to use the machinery which is at their disposal in an efficient, effective and responsible manner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 115 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 613 general service recruits were enlisted in the Defence Forces in 1998 and a further 580 recruits were enlisted in 1999. The Government's target for recruitment as set out in <Col N="1198" /> the Action Programme for the Millennium was to recruit 1,500 personnel over four years. This target will be well exceeded. The maximum monthly strength of the Defence Forces in these years was 11,701 in 1998, and 11,339 in 1999. I cannot, therefore, accept the suggestion that the policy of continuous recruitment has somehow failed. All major employers, in both the private and public sectors, and including the Civil Service Commission and the Garda Síochána, are now experiencing a general decrease in the number of applicants coming forward in response to various public recruitment competitions. The Defence Forces are no exception, and cannot remain immune to such universal market trends, given the wide variety of employment and other personal development options, such as further education, which are available to the present day school leaver and job seeker.</P>
    <P>However, it remains the case that, in general terms, the Defence Forces are still attracting more than a sufficient number of suitable candidates of the standard and calibre required for the filling of the general body of vacancies on offer.</P>

      <P>The Army Ranger Wing was formally established in 1979 to assist the Garda Síochána, under aid to the civil power arrangements, in dealing with incidents such as hijackings and kidnappings. Members of the Army Ranger Wing are selected from among suitable serving personnel who volunteer for service with the ARW and they are expected to serve with the unit for about two years after which time they are, as a general rule, returned to their units and replaced. Members are trained to requisite levels of motivation, physical fitness and skill at arms for their specialist role.</P>
      <P>The Army Ranger Wing is liable to be called upon to undertake duties in any part of the country and the decision as to whether the unit would be deployed in a particular situation would be taken by the chief of staff following consultation with myself as Minister for Defence. At present, there are 30 members of the Army Ranger Wing serving with INTERFET in East Timor for a period of four months. Before personnel from any unit are committed to overseas service, the operational requirements at home are fully assessed and take priority at all times. I am fully satisfied that the operational capacity of the Army Ranger Wing has not been compromised by the involvement with INTERFET. I feel that such service will be a very beneficial experience for the personnel concerned.</P>

      <P>By sealed order, dated 28 August 1946, the Minister for Defence is authorised by the Government, under the direction of the President acting on the advice of the Government, to exercise military command over the Defence Forces and all executive and administrative powers in relation to the said forces, including the power to delegate command and authority. This order is continued in force by section 299 of the Defence Act, 1954.</P>
      <P>In order to provide a greater focus on military effectiveness and efficiency the Defence Forces review implementation plan, which was approved by Government in March 1996, proposed the reorganisation of the top level military structure. Legislative change was required to give effect to these proposals which had the full support of the military authorities.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1998, which came into effect on 1 October 1998, amended the Defence Act, 1954, to prescribe these changes. As a result a new Defence Forces headquarters has been put in place, the head of which is the chief of staff. Therefore, there is now only one military branch in the Department of Defence, instead of three military branches which had existed previously. The chief of staff now has responsibility for the performance of the full range of the military business of the Department and he is the sole military officer reporting directly to me on such business. The appointments of adjutant-general and quartermaster-general have been replaced by two new appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff &ndash; Operations &ndash; and Deputy Chief of Staff &ndash; Support. The chief of staff has, with the approval of the Minister delegated duties assigned to him to the Deputy Chiefs of Staff and they in turn are responsible for and report to the Chief of Staff on such duties as are assigned to them.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, the question of the appointment of an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions at Conciliation and Arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.</P>
      <P>Revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996. The revised procedures provide for the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister. All complaints, other than the most trivial or vexatious, are referred to him by the Minister. The agreement also provided that the revised complaints procedures should operate on a trial basis for two years, after which a review of the procedures should take place. This review is now being undertaken by sub-committees of the Conciliation Council established for that purpose. I have no wish to interfere in their deliberations but I will say that it is vital that all members of the Defence Forces have confidence in the outcome of that review. It should not be beyond us to create a procedural formula for dealing with grievances that satisfies all concerned and at the same time maintains the ethos of the military way of life.</P>

    <P>The balance of the total cost of the contract is made up of VAT payments. Funding for this purchase programme is available as a result of the reduction in the strength of the permanent Defence Force. The reduction in manpower was mainly achieved by means of a voluntary early retirement scheme which was availed of by over 1,500 personnel in the period 1996 to 1998, at a cost of over £65 million in retirement benefits. From 1999 onwards, payroll savings of approximately £15 million have begun to accrue and 50% of these savings have been made available for investment in additional new equipment.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of loadings by insurers is universal throughout the EU and is not subject to State regulation. In fact, EU law on insurance prevents Governments or insurance regulators from specifying policy prices or terms. Accordingly, there is no agreement or guidelines concerning loadings. Furthermore, I would regard any such agreement as anti-competitive and therefore not in the interests of consumers affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> Motor insurance premia are normally based on underwriting experience. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint. The premia charged and the availability of a quote will reflect any material increase in the risk. While it is a matter for the insurance company to judge the risk, in my view, failure to display an insurance disc is a serious offence.</P>
    <P>In cases of refusals to quote for motor insurance, the declined cases agreement between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Irish Insurance Federation offers the motorist the opportunity of a motor quotation subject to certain criteria.</P>

      <P>In May 1998, the Government decided that a light rail line should be developed from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport. The Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green section of that line has completed the necessary statutory procedures and preliminary physical works have begun. In the meantime, geotechnical studies of the St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone section have been completed and the technical feasibility of constructing this underground section confirmed. A preliminary public consultation process for the Broadstone to Dublin Airport section has also been undertaken and is continuing.</P>
      <P>In June 1999, the Government endorsed light rail as a pilot public private partnership project. I subsequently commissioned a consultancy study which recommended that the design and construction of the St. Stephen's Green to Dublin Airport line should be approached on the basis of PPP.</P>
      <P>I have also recently received a report from the light rail advisory-action group suggesting that, subject to certain caveats, 2005 should be set as an indicative completion date for the entire route. I will shortly report to Government on the geotechnical and PPP studies, taking account of the advisory group's recommendations.</P>

      <P>Members of the Defence Forces serving with the stabilisation force in Bosnia-Herzegovina &ndash; SFOR &ndash; the Kosovo Force &ndash; KFOR &ndash; the European Community Monitoring Mission to former Yugoslavia &ndash; ECMM &ndash; and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo &ndash; UNMIK &ndash; are issued with the current pattern combat operational boot. Those serving with the Organisation on Security and Co-operation in Europe &ndash; OSCE &ndash; are issued with an allowance to cater for the purchase of civil pattern items of winter clothing. During a recent period of extremely severe weather in Sarajevo the 50 personnel serving with SFOR were issued with Matterhorn boots. All personnel serving with the aforementioned organisations are also issued with thermal underwear as standard.</P>
      <P>The new disruptive pattern material &ndash; DPM &ndash; field dress which incorporates a layered system of clothing has been given to personnel serving with SFOR, KFOR and UNMIK. Personnel serving with ECMM are required to wear items of clothing and uniform which are white in colour. The issue of clothing to these personnel therefore includes a cold weather parka jacket, white combat clothing and white gortex rain suits.</P>
      <P>Defence Forces personnel currently serve in various missions throughout the entire Balkan region and accordingly the type of terrain in which they operate and the climate can vary considerably. However, winter conditions in the region can be particularly harsh. Every effort is made to ensure that the specific clothing issued to the personnel serving with each different mission is the best available and is suited to the operational and climatic conditions which are likely to be encountered.</P>

      <Quest>if persons (details supplied) in County Wexford will be paid on full 1999 special beef premium applications; and if his current ewe subsidy application is satisfactory further to a recent inspection by his Department whereby he and his wife had their full ewes present.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two applications were submitted in respect of special beef premium in 1999 by the first person named: 39 animals on 3 February 1999; 14 animals on 23 June 1999.</P>
      <P>The second application was the subject of an on-farm inspection on 5 October 1999. The inspection revealed that two animals were not in the applicant's ownership and possession at the date of application. The person named was offered an opportunity to provide information on these animals and whether other eligible animals were in the herd at the time of application. The Department has recently been informed that no other eligible animals were present in the herd. A formal decision informing the first person named of the outcome of the inspection will issue within the next few days.  </P>
      <P>Under the 2000 ewe premium schemes two separate applications were submitted by the persons named. One of the applications under the first herd number quoted was in respect of 485 ewes. At the inspection of this flock on 8 February last he was deemed to be in breach of the terms and conditions of the scheme as 200 of the 485 ewes he applied on were found on lands not declared on his application form. The inspecting officer advised him that the possible penalty was rejection of his 2000 claim. He was also advised that a written decision on the result of the inspection would be issued to him by the local district superintendent and that if he wanted to bring any additional information on the inspection to the Department's notice he could do so by writing to the district superintendent. He has not done so to date. A written decision on the outcome of the inspection will be conveyed in writing to him by the district superintendent as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In regard to the inspection carried out on the same day under the second herd number quoted 24 ewes of the 263 ewes applied on were missing at the inspection. As this was in breach of the terms and conditions of the scheme the person named was advised at the inspection that the possible penalty was loss of premium on the missing ewes and a reduction in payment on the remaining ewes. As in the case of the first herd number quoted, the second herdowner was advised on the same lines. She has not written to date to the local district superintendent who will be issuing a written decision on the outcome of the inspection to her as soon as possible.</P>

The person named appealed this decision to the headage and premia appeals unit and following re-examination, the decision was upheld. He was notified accordingly by letter of 10 February 2000.</P>

      <P>On 13 October 1999 I announced my intention to introduce, by way of national regulations, applicable from 1 April 2000, an arrangement for the transfer of milk quota other than the current system whereby such quota transfers with land.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for: more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime; greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers; the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible; greater competitiveness within the Irish milk production sector.</P>
      <P>As I already announced, the position which will obtain after 1 April 2000 where milk quotas will no longer transfer with land, will be subject to certain exceptions. The exceptions will cover family transactions, renewals of existing leases between the original lessor and lessee, sale of a holding as a going concern and the transfer by way of lease or sale of land purchased with quota between 13 October 1999 and 31 March 2000. Detailed conditions in relation to these exceptions will be defined.</P>

      <P>The FEOGA pillar, to be called the agricultural payments office &ndash; APO &ndash; will be responsible for the administration of virtually all moneys disbursed in Ireland under the Common Agricultural Policy, amounting to a total of almost £2 billion per annum, of which approximately 75% derives from EU funds.</P>

Under section 469, tax relief may be claimed, subject to certain conditions, for &ldquo;health expenses&rdquo;. Health expenses are defined as expenses in respect of the provision of health care, being expenses representing the cost of, among other things, &ldquo;drugs or medicines supplied on the prescription of a practitioner&rdquo;. It is the view of the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of any medicines supplied on the prescription of a practitioner, i.e. a medical doctor or a dentist, qualifies for tax relief.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Eastern Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has been experiencing difficulties in the provision of orthodontic services in their regional orthodontic unit at St. James's Hospital over the past few months.  I understand from the board that these difficulties were caused by the consultant orthodontist's unilateral decision to withdraw from the provision of orthodontic assessments, orthodontic opinions and the commencement of orthodontic appliance therapy for new patients. The position was exacerbated by the withdrawal of consultant cover and the consultant orthodontist's refusal to provide guidance to dental clinicians regarding orthodontic procedures. The consultant orthodontist's actions led to her suspension from duty without pay with effect from 4 November 1999.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Eastern Health Board, my predecessor in office recently terminated the suspension of the consultant orthodontist in question. I understand from the board that the consultant orthodontist recently resumed duty. The board will endeavour to ensure that patients will be seen from the waiting list as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Ques tion No. 165 of 1 December 1999, he will make a statement on recent suggestions that the alarming increase in the level of caesarian sections in maternity hospitals over the past ten years has been caused by the growth of defensive medicine brought on by increased litigation and increased insurance costs.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to perform a caesarean section is a medical decision that is taken by a qualified medical professional. While increased medico-legal litigation and defensive medicine are linked, there are no statistics to show the association, if any, between the two in relation to caesarean sections performed in this country. While rates for the procedure in Ireland have increased, this rate would now, on average, be comparable to the UK and the USA. There are many reasons why the number of caesarean sections have increased. These include greater patient awareness and demand, proven methods of antepartum and intrapartum foetal distress, together with reduced maternal morbidity. However, I have asked my Department's chief medical officer to seek the views of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as the organisation with professional responsibility for standards in this area.</P>

      <P>The latest statistics available to my Department show that there are 295 people awaiting cataract surgery in the Southern Health Board region.</P>
      <P>Following the review of the waiting list initiative in 1998, a strategy was developed to manage the waiting list issue in a co-ordinated and integrated manner. This strategy is showing success, as evidenced by a reduction of 9% in the numbers on waiting lists in the first three quarters of 1999. Figures for the end of December 1999 are currently being collated by health agencies and are due for submission to my Department this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the strategy for managing the waiting list issue, service providers have been asked to begin submitting data on waiting times in each of the target specialities, including ophthalmology. This process was undertaken for the first time during 1999 and the methodology is being <Col N="1221" /> developed further in order to ensure that useful and meaningful data on average waiting times can be produced.</P>

      <P>The drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July, 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. The primary aim of the drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services and the drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available, additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These criteria range from uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. With regard to quinine sulphate, this product is authorised for the treatment of malaria and for no other indication.</P>

      <P>Health boards are required to provide general practitioner services to all medical card patients and such services are provided by doctors holding general medical services scheme contracts. The contract sets out both the conditions under which services are to be provided to medical card holders and the relationship between the board and the contracted doctor in terms of accepting and assigning patients.</P>
      <P>The contract provides that in a situation where a general practitioner does not wish to accept a particular patient he or she can be requested by the board to provide, confidentially, the reasons for his or her unwillingness. Ultimately, however, the board has, under the contract, the power to assign patients to ensure their medical needs are met. Where assignment takes place, there is provision for such assignment to be reviewed at the doctor's request after a six months' period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While no formal guidelines have been issued by my Department, the matter of dealing with difficult or abusive medical card patients is one which the community care and primary care units <Col N="1224" /> in each health board are best placed to deal with given their specialist local knowledge. In such cases, the units will generally work with the doctor or doctors involved to ensure the provision of a service and with the patient to see that he or she understands the importance of maintaining a mutually co-operative relationship with their general practitioner.</P>

      <P>The waste management plan for the Dublin region provides for the introduction of household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclable materials, as well as an extended network of bring facilities, civic amenity sites and other waste treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>I understand that proposals for the implementation of an extensive new collection service for recyclables, which will include waste paper, are already at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>In so far as the financing of waste services is concerned, regard must be had to the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle. It is apparent that relatively low waste disposal costs have militated against a good material recycling performance and waste recovery generally. National waste management policy, as set out in the policy statement: Changing our Ways strongly advocates that local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for the waste services which they provide, by means of use-related waste charges levied on all waste producers, including households and commercial-business concerns. Currently, Dublin Corporation is one of a small minority of local authorities which does not levy household waste charges.</P>

      <P>The most recent authoritative survey of Dublin taxi services is set out in the report Review of Taxi and Hackney Carriage Service in the Dublin Area, by Oscar Faber consultants, June 1998. This estimated that there was a shortfall in taxi supply equivalent to over 2,200 in 1998 and that this would increase to some 3,500 by 2008. These estimates, compounded by strong growth in the national and Dublin economies, form the background to the Government's recent initiative on Dublin taxi numbers.</P>
      <P>The measures announced by the Government involve the offer of one additional taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi licence to each individual who held a licence in the Dublin taximeter area at end 1999, as well as 500 further licences to be granted to applicants under the current points assessment system. Arrangements for the allocation of licences to existing licence holders are now under way. Applications have been invited by Dublin Corporation for submission by 18 February 2000.</P>
      <P>With effect from the issue of offers by Dublin Corporation to these applicants for the grant of licences, a period of four months will be allowed in the case of an ordinary taxi licence and six months in the case of a wheelchair accessible taxi licence, in order to finalise the uptake of licences by applicants. I have carried out extensive discussions with a range of representative groups from the Dublin taxi industry regarding these and other arrangements involved.</P>
      <P>As regards a long-term plan for transport in Dublin, the Dublin Transportation Office are currently finalising a major updating of the present Dublin transport initiative strategy. This will focus on developing the best solutions for responding to and managing transport demand in the Dublin region over the period 2000-2016, using all appropriate transport modes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines for staff entitled Claims and Late Claims detail how the provisions for late claims should be applied. These are published on the Internet on my Department's website at www.welfare.ie. I am <Col N="1228" /> arranging for a copy of these guidelines to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits are set out in section 205 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as amended, and in regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a claim is made late, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.</P>
      <P>In addition to the statutory provisions, there are extra-statutory provisions to extend the time limits in the case of a number of schemes in certain exceptional circumstances. Regulations made by me in 1998 &ndash; S.I. No 55 of 1998 &ndash; replaced these extra-statutory provisions in respect of a number of contributory pension schemes. Regulations to be made by me shortly will put the remaining extra-statutory provisions on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Payment may be made for up to 12 months on foot of late claims for old age (contributory) pension, retirement pension and widows and widowers (contributory) pension. Where a claim under these schemes is more than 12 months late, the period of payment is extended on a proportional basis. Payment may also be made on foot of late claims in the case of a range of other schemes for a period of six months prior to the date of claim provided there was good cause for the late claim.</P>
      <P>These restrictions on backdating late claims are relaxed and further payment may be made, up to the level of full retrospection where the circumstances would warrant it, where the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department; or illness or a <i>force majeure </i>prevented a person from claiming earlier; or the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</P>
      <P>There are arrangements in place in my Department for ensuring that the above provisions are applied in appropriate cases. Different arrangements operate for different schemes. In the case of contributory old age, retirement or widow(er)'s pensions, late claimants whose claims are not backdated in full are advised automatically of the circumstances in which they may qualify for further backdating. In other cases, the entitlement to arrears under the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; provisions is examined in the light of the information furnished with the claim on the reasons for claiming late. Where this suggests that the extra-statutory provisions are applicable, the persons eligibility under these provisions is examined and enquiries are made as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new regulations referred to above which I am proposing to make in the near future will bring together the discretionary arrangements affecting a range of schemes. In parallel with this proposal, my Department is carrying out a review of the administrative arrangements in operation for dealing with late claims to ensure that all claimants are fully aware of the circumstances in <Col N="1229" /> which they may qualify for additional arrears under the new regulations.</P>

      <P>In response to a recent question from the Deputy on this matter, I explained the circumstances which had given rise to the current difficulty in providing a special support service for the child in question. I also indicated the arrangements which are being made by my Department to address this issue.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that my Department will be in a position to appoint a suitably qualified teacher to cater for the child in question and other children in the area in the near future. In the meantime, I am arranging for a visiting teacher from a neighbouring area to visit the child as soon as possible. The manager of the visiting teacher service, will arrange for this visiting teacher to liaise with the child's class teacher, the remedial teacher and the resource teacher in the school to advise them on how best to cater for the child's needs pending the appointment of a dedicated visiting teacher for the area.</P>

      <P>Two psychologists of the national educational psychological service already provide a service to all second level schools in County Waterford. There is no service available, as yet, to primary schools in the county.</P>
      <P>A competition for recruitment to the NEPS agency is currently being organised by the civil service and local appointments commissioners. This is now at a very advanced stage and it is envisaged that there will be approximately 50 additional psychologists in post by the end of the year 2000. This will make a substantial difference to the level of service available in all areas of the country.</P>
      <P>The general principles for deployment of additional staff have been agreed by the management committee of NEPS, in consultation with the NEPS national policy advisory board, which is representative of the main client groups. They have agreed that, after current vacancies have been filled, each new cohort of psychologists should be distributed between all regions, on a pro rata basis, according to the pupil numbers in each region. The ultimate target is that, by the end of the development phase of NEPS, end 2004, all schools will have ready access to educational psychologists.</P>
      <P>For some time now, the management of NEPS has been collecting evidence of need on a county by county basis, using Government and Department statistics and data supplied by local interests. Within each region, priorities will be set according to these identified needs and to the level of current access to psychological services. The management of NEPS is aware of the particular problems of the Waterford area and will make every effort to ensure that these needs will be met as soon as additional psychologists become available.</P>
