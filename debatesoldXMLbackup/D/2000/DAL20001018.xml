      <P>What action, legislative or otherwise, will the Government take to ensure, in the wake of the recent court judgment, there will be adequate numbers of taxis in Dublin, particularly between now and Christmas, to allow young people get home safely after a night's entertainment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is still before the courts. As Deputy Bruton knows, the court will make its final decision next Tuesday. The 45 page decision given by the High Court last Friday will be examined. It raises fundamental legal and policy issues. The court has given two weeks for parties to consider what order should follow from its legal finding. The Government is treating it as a matter of urgency. The Attorney General has consulted with the State's legal team and their detailed advices are expected in the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are acutely aware there are short-term and medium-term issues which must be addressed. We are determined, as the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said many times, to address this as a matter of urgency. However, we want to ensure that whatever we do is fair to the travelling public, to those who already work in the taxi and hackney business and those who want to <Col N="514" /> work in this sector, which is vital to the success of public transport policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that a legal judgment of this kind casts serious doubts on the Government's competence in preparing its scheme and on its legal advice in allowing such a situation to develop so close to Christmas, when people want to get home safely at night and are not interested in protracted legal arguments which should have been settled three years ago, when this issue should have been dealt with?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, there is a difficulty with the sound system in this Chamber because the Taoiseach, who is normally strong of voice, can no longer be heard on this side of the House. I am sure that is not due to any reticence on the Taoiseach's part.</P>

      <P>There is obviously a problem. I said that last Friday's High Court decision on taxis raises complex and fundamental legal and policy issues. The court has given two weeks for parties to consider what order should follow from its legal finding. They will explain their position in more detail next week. We are treating the matter as one of urgency. The Attorney General has consulted the State's legal team and their detailed advices are expected in the next few days. We are acutely aware there are short-term and medium-term issues which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>On 30 November 1999 the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on behalf of the Government announced a system which would have given an immediate 3,100 licences in the Dublin area. That was challenged, not by the taxi drivers but by the hackney drivers, which is what created the current difficulty. Unfortunately, it has taken from February until now to go through the courts. However, as soon as the matters are cleared up next week, the Government will move on decisions.</P>

      <P>Amnesty International is organising a worldwide campaign today, which is taking place in Kilmainham Gaol in this city, designed to stamp out torture. Ireland some years ago signed a UN convention entitled The Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. In view of the fact that we will soon become a full member of the Security Council and given the day that is in it, when is it intended to ratify this convention, so that we do not find ourselves in a situation on the Security Council where we are not in line with many other countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, we signed it some time ago. I think I previously gave the ratification date to the House but I will have to check when that was. I stated at that stage that the work to implement it was ongoing, but I will check the date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to our new responsibilities on the Security Council, it would be appropriate for the Taoiseach to give a pledge today &ndash; I suspect many Members of the House are members of Amnesty International and would like to be associated with this matter &ndash; that the Oireachtas will give a solemn undertaking that it will attempt to ratify this convention before the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach introduce courts or criminal justice legislation to allow for the appointment of more judges in view of the fact that there are 170 rape cases and 53 murder cases awaiting trial who cannot find a judge to hear them? Meanwhile judges are taken up in tribunals where Members or former Members are not assisting them in getting the work done.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will probably be aware that the Committee of Public Accounts public hearings into DIRT resume on 30 November. The only major area in which there has not been a response is in the area of Dáil reform. Are we likely to have, legislatively or otherwise, a package of Dáil reform in advance of 30 June?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach informed the House yesterday that the unseemly row between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance on who would regulate the financial services industry had been solved and gave a vague commitment to Deputy Rabbitte about the publication of a Bill. Last week he told me we would have the Bill this session. Will the Taoiseach explain the position? Have the heads of the Bill gone through Government, is it gone for drafting and when will it be introduced? I want no ambiguity this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said last week was that the heads of the Financial Services <Col N="517" /> (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill are expected late this year and the Bill is expected next year. On the other matter, I said the Bill would be available shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be a Bill before Christmas to regulate the financial services industry with a single regulator? Has the row between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance concluded? Has the joint memorandum gone to Government? The Taoiseach is dodging the issue and pretending one thing. He was asked about this particularly last week but now he has a different answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the discussions that took place yesterday in the context of the EU directive, will the Taoiseach say whether the Government intends to bring before the House legislation to implement the provisions of the directive or will the directive simply be regarded as directly applicable? Will he indicate by what date this directive must be brought into force? In the context of the question raised by Deputy Howlin, will he indicate whether there will be a debate in the House next week to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain the actions taken by him yesterday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We want clarification because it appears the Minister's position went beyond the terms of the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act. There is no other legislation on the Statute Book in relation to this matter. It appears the Minister's position is different from that adopted by this House in those Acts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can be helpful on the legislation. The Minister's position is exactly consistent with the two Acts passed in the House. The wording in the directive, as initially proposed by the Presidency, would have had a detrimental effect on the freedom of institutions under the direction or control of a body for religious purposes from maintaining their religious ethos because the proposed wording was narrower than the exclusion contained in the Employment Equality Act or the Equal Status Act. After the negotiations yesterday, which have gone on for some months, the French Presidency agreed to reword the draft with a view to ensuring we can maintain our existing provisions set out in the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The House will recall the provisions of that Act took approximately two years to develop and were agreed after extensive consultation with the social partners, including all the teachers' unions and the denominational and parents' interests. Failure to maintain our existing provisions would have had a particularly detrimental effect on minority churches which had lobbied strongly in the past few weeks that we would not move away from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Shatter, perhaps he will put down a question to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform issued two separate statements. Initially he said, &ldquo;support the ethos of an institution&rdquo; and later he said, &ldquo;not undermine&rdquo;. One is consistent with legislation and the other is not. Will the Taoiseach allow the matter to be clarified by statement from himself or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? That is the least we are entitled to.</P>

      <P>I have had this matter examined in great detail since Committee Stage. I understand the 1988 Act refers to export credit insurance. It is not intended when the Insurance Acts are referred to collectively that they should include reference to export credit insurance legislation but rather <Col N="527" /> solely to the legislation concerned with the supervision of the insurance industry. Accordingly, this amendment would not be relevant. It would not be appropriate to refer collectively to all these Acts, particularly including export credit insurance in this area because the ramifications of this new Act does not affect export credit insurance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just received the groupings and I have some difficulty in determining why they were grouped together.</P>
      <P>The Minister agreed on Committee Stage to look again at amendment No. 2 for Report Stage. This amendment gives a definition to connected persons. I want a definition included in the Companies Act because this does not exist at present. I hope the Minister of State will address amendment No. 4 which relates to commission payments and sales remuneration. We teased out many issues relating to connected persons, what defines a connected person and how they are related to an individual involved in the brokering business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 relates to disclosure, the monitoring of disclosure and how this would be adjudicated on. This goes back to the debate we had on the issue of equivalence. It is not sufficient for the Minister of State to say there will be equivalence within the legislation. There should <Col N="528" /> be a commitment to this in the Bill so that there is a level playing pitch between the brokers, banks, building societies and so on who also provide insurance. There is also the issue of travel agents, which we will discuss later.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will explain why these amendments have been grouped together. These amendments were debated in great detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for his contribution and for tabling these amendments. The purpose of the amendments is to provide for equivalence of disclosure in respect of commissions and for the policing of equivalence. The Government is committed to ensuring there is equivalence, that it will be policed and that there will be full disclosure on commissions.</P>
      <P>The issue of equivalence was discussed on Committee Stage. The reason the amendments are grouped together is that they are all linked to both equivalence and commissions. Having reflected on the points made by Deputy Naughten and others on Committee Stage, I saw the merit in providing for this in the Bill. I do not propose to accept the amendments tabled by Deputy Naughten in their present form. However, I accept them in spirit and I have decided to table amendment No. 8 which makes similar provision in the Bill. It is the intention to deal with the equivalence in the disclosure regulations. I am now informing the House that I propose to insert a new subsection (2) to section 7, paragraph 43D, to require the equivalence of disclosure as between commission payments to insurance intermediaries and sales remuneration to sales employees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Naughten tabled on Committee Stage an amendment to provide for powers to monitor the provisions of this section, with particular reference to equivalence. Having considered the points made by the Deputy at that stage, I have decided to insert a further provision to permit monitoring, not just of equivalence but also of the other provisions in the section. Consequently, I will be moving two amendments, No. 8, which is a very strong macro amendment, and amendment No. 9, which is purely a technical adjustment because we must renumber the section.</P>

      <P>If I understand the Minister of State correctly, the amendment will allow for regulation after the passing of the legislation and it comes back to a detailed debate on Committee Stage about regulation and the lack of control the House has over orders passed by the Minister. The Minister has published the suppliers of life assurance order, 2000, as a consultation order. <Col N="529" /> Given that it has been circulated within the industry, why has it not been circulated to Members? On Committee Stage the Minister of State stated: &ldquo;I will give the Deputy a detailed opportunity to appraise these regulations.&rdquo;  Why has this not happened?</P>
      <P>The House has no control to ensure these regulations are reviewed, questioned and debated by Members. Unless an objection is made in the House within 21 days, which is not possible, the regulations are passed. While I accept the points raised by the Minister of State, regulation is an issue of concern that needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled amendment No. 8 which clearly provides, in principle, for equivalence. This is a major progressive step based on the Committee Stage debate. We are working on the final draft of the disclosure regulations. I am not aware of any document which has been produced and circulated for consultation entitled suppliers of life assurance order, 2000.</P>
      <P>We intend to hold consultations before we finally publish the regulations. They must be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and Members of both Houses will then have the right to query them and will have 21 days to raise objections if they so wish. We are bound to publish them in the newspapers giving adequate notice both to the industry and the consumer.</P>
      <P>The regulations are the most relevant area to deal with this matter. They can be amended at any time in the future rather than having to wait for primary legislation. We must respond to changes in the market as we move into an era of e-commerce, e-business and e-retailing. The insurance industry and consumers are moving rapidly forward in this area and we must be in a position to adopt new regulations as required by the market to which society and the Legislature will refer in future. Consequently, the place to deal with this issue is in the disclosure regulations.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister of State's comments and I withdraw the amendments but an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 1 October pointed out that a draft of the suppliers of life assurance order, 2000, had been circulated to interested parties. The Minister of State gave us a commitment on Committee Stage that we would be briefed on these regulations before they were published and came into force. It is unfair that he gave such a commitment and a draft of the regulations was circulated. Two Members who tabled amendments on Committee Stage and raised the issue of the regulations were not shown the courtesy of being informed about the circulation of this draft order.</P>

As far as I am aware, the previous Opposition spokespersons received copies of the regulations at the time.

A final document has not been produced but I give the Deputy a commitment that when it is there will be a briefing session between my officials and the main Opposition spokespersons, particularly Deputies Naughten and Upton, who are dealing with the Bill on behalf of their parties.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>m</i>) by the insertion of the following after the definition of &lsquo;the Minister':</P>
      <P>&lsquo;&ldquo;occupational pension scheme&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Pensions Act, 1990;',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 13 relate to the occupational pension scheme which we debated on Committee Stage. They are self-explanatory and seek to include occupational pension schemes under the disclosure regime. One of the main objectives of the Bill is to ensure consumer protection and provide for disclosure on a level playing field. This relates to the issue of equivalence to which the Minister has agreed.</P>
      <P>The group schemes which are defined under section 2 of the 1990 Act and the draft regulations pursuant to section 51 of the 1980 Act, which the Minister proposes to adopt, exempt such schemes from the disclosure regime. Given that group schemes can have as few as three members, consumer protection is not achieved by the exemption of such schemes from the disclosure requirements. Occupational pension schemes should be treated similar to other insurance schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 3 would be to require the inclusion of pension schemes under the disclosure regime. It is our intention that they should be included. I have tabled amendment No. 16 in response to the amendment tabled by Deputy Naughten on Committee Stage and the arguments he made. The purpose of the amendment is to insert a new subsection providing that insurance companies will be obliged by law to provide information to trustees of pension schemes in future when such trustees are required under the Pension Act to provide specified information to the members of the various pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our intention that the disclosure regulations to be made on foot of this legislation will include disclosure in respect of occupational pension schemes. However, this legislation is not the best vehicle for providing effective disclosure for members of such schemes for two reasons. First, it would not provide for all pension schemes. In <Col N="531" /> other words, by specifying some, others would be excluded and that would be dangerous. Some occupational pension schemes are run by companies other than insurance companies and they are not subject to the provisions of the Insurance Acts. The coverage of schemes would not be fully complete.</P>
    <P>Second, while the disclosure regime envisaged in the legislation is designed for disclosure at point of sale, ongoing disclosure is probably more important in terms of pension schemes, especially in regard to existing schemes and, therefore, provision for disclosure to members of pension schemes in the Bill would be limited in its usefulness. The Pensions Board is examining the issue of disclosure.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 will ensure that when a disclosure regime is introduced for the members of pension schemes all the necessary information will be available to the trustees of such schemes. To eliminate any doubt about the provision of information in future to the trustees of pensions schemes, I have tabled that amendment and consequently I cannot accept amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 37, before &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in a case where the information concerned was concealed by the fraud of the defendant,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As discussed on Committee Stage, as the Bill stands there is a possibility of open ended prosecution in the District Court. This should be limited to fraudulent concealment of information and there should be a specific statement to that effect rather than leaving it open ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment to the 1989 Act envisaged in section 4 seeks to permit summary proceedings to be taken against a person accused of an offence under the Insurance Acts either within two years of the offence being committed or within six months of the offence being discovered, subject to an overall limit of five years since the offence was committed. This amendment is deemed necessary in light of the experience of the Department in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six months provided in the 1989 Act have proved impractical even when an offence is detected immediately. More time is needed to gather evidence and to prepare proceedings. In addition, unfortunately, in the nature of insurance, it may be more than two years before an offence comes to light. The amendment proposed by Deputy Upton would create difficulties <Col N="532" /> for us in prosecuting offences. For example, fraudulent concealment would have to be proved, thus delaying matters to the point where the provision would be inoperable.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware from all the ongoing investigations in which the Department is involved, the position has been advanced in the new legislation. Once information comes to a Minister, an official, the Department, an investigating officer, an inspector or the courts, proceedings can go ahead irrespective of when the matter is discovered. If the amendment was accepted, it would negate the provisions already included in company law. This legislation would be in conflict with those provisions and the amendment would weaken the Bill. Consequently, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 36, to delete &ldquo;occur.'.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;occur.</P>
      <P>(1C) A person who was carrying on the business referred to in subsection (1) before the commencement of <i>section 5</i> of the <i>Insurance Act, 2000</i>, shall, not later than 60 days after such commencement, give notice to the Minister, in such form and manner and including such information as may be prescribed, of the person's intention to continue to carry on that business, and subsection (1B) shall apply to a notice under this subsection as it applies to a notice referred to in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) with any necessary modifications.</P>
      <P>(1D) A person who contravenes subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) or who contravenes subsection (1C) and continues to carry on the business referred to in that subsection shall be guilty of an offence.</P>

      <P>(<i>b</i>) information that is, to the knowledge of the company, false or misleading is included in a notice of the company under subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) or (1C),</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) the Minister considers that, having regard to the risks insured or proposed to be insured by the company, the company is under capitalised,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) the Minister considers that one or more or the directors or the senior managers of the company are not suitably <Col N="533" /> qualified to direct and manage the business aforesaid of the company,</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) the Minister considers that the company has not a sufficient number of suitably qualified employees in the State to carry on effectively the business aforesaid, or</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>) the Minister is in possession of information showing that the company has engaged in unlawful activities in or outside the State.</P>
    <P>(1F) Where the Minister proposes to give a direction to a company under subsection (1E)&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) he shall notify the company in writing of the proposal and shall include in the notification a statement of the reasons for the proposal,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) the company may, within 28 days of the date of the notification, make submission in writing to the Minister in relation to the proposal,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) the Minister shall, before deciding to give a direction and determining its terms, take into consideration any representations made to him pursuant to paragraph (<i>b</i>).</P>
    <P>(1G) Subsections (5) to (9) of section 18 shall apply to a direction under this section as they apply to a direction under that section with any necessary modifications.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment inserts four new subsections in section 5 which deals with reinsurance. The purpose of the new subsections is to give the Minister powers to take administrative steps to deal with any existing Irish reinsurance companies that might be, have been or will be the subject of complaints from either Irish or international sources. This is necessary to protect Irish and international consumers and to protect Ireland's reputation as a well regulated financial services centre.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1C) provides a transitional period for existing reinsurance companies of 60 days to return the notice required under subsection (1)(<i>b</i>). Subsection (1D) provides that failure to provide the requisite notice to the Minister while carrying on reinsurance business is an offence in law. Subsection (1E) provides that the Minister may give a direction to a company to cease writing reinsurance business in the absence of compliance with the notification provisions. Subsection (1G) provides an appeal mechanism to companies writing such business.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to protect consumers of reinsurance products, to ensure that there is a right to deal with reinsurance companies and that the Department can take action at any particular time if information is provided to it.</P>

      <P>This positive amendment will enhance the Bill. I wish to raise a point which the Minister might consider. I doubt he could address it under this legislation but it is important to note in relation to the protection of the consumer that there are various levels of regulation throughout the European Union in terms of the insurance industry. If some of the Irish companies involved in insurance and reinsurance decided to establish an e-commerce business, an area for which the Minister of State also has responsibility, they would face varying regulation throughout the European Union. This would create severe financial pressure in terms of the viability of any such project.</P>
      <P>Upcoming European Union provisions mean that the legislation in the country in which the consumer is located is the law that must be followed when a product is being sold. There could be variations in the legislation in the 15 EU member states. The number of member states will increase as a result of enlargement and perhaps the Minister of State could talk to his European colleagues with a view to streamlining this area within the EU. This would be difficult because there are varying levels of regulation, such as the most recent provisions introduced in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There can be extremes in terms of over regulation or under regulation in other parts of the EU, but perhaps the Minister of State could consider the issue given that he has responsibility for e-commerce.

      <P>Deputy Naughten's points are positive and relevant. We are moving into an era of e-commerce and Ireland has the most sophisticated legislation on e-commerce transactions in the world. Equivalence between paper and electronic transactions has been provided and it is important to move onto the next stage. I will ask the officials in the insurance unit of the Department, in conjunction with the officials in the e-commerce division, to examine this aspect in detail. Further legislation in this area is being considered and, if it is appropriate, I will include the matter in that Bill. If necessary, I will enter into consultation with the European Commission or the Council of Ministers on the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 27 and 28, to delete &ldquo;, subject to section 108 of the Insurance Act, 1936, be provided in the English language&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;be provided in both official languages of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 108 of the Insurance Act is restrictive. It states that if the insured fills out the proposal wholly in Irish and requests to be corresponded with in Irish, the insurer shall do so. The Bill provides that unless this section is complied with, the <Col N="535" /> insurance shall be given in English. My proposal is that it should be available in both Irish and English. I understand a language equality Bill is due to be introduced and it would be much more appropriate if it was automatically available in Irish and English.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much merit in Deputy Upton's proposal and I would like to be able to accept the amendment. However, it is not that simple. The amendment provides that insurers offering insurance in Ireland will automatically have to make documentation available in Irish and English. The existing provision means that documentation must be made available in Irish at the request of the client.</P>
      <P>Since 1936 Irish law has required that when a policy holder completes a proposal for insurance in Irish, that documentation from the insurer shall be provided in Irish if the policy holder so requests. The third insurance directive opened the entire European Union market to EU insurance companies. Any new conditions to be imposed on insurers in any part of the European Union would have to be justified. Otherwise, they could be seen as a barrier to the Single Market.</P>
      <P>It may be difficult to justify the condition proposed by Deputy Upton since only a small number of people in Ireland are likely to opt for receiving documentation in Irish. We checked with the Irish Insurance Federation and it informed us that, over the past decade, there have been only two requests for documentation in Irish. The Deputy's concerns, which I share, may be alleviated by the knowledge that insurers operating in the Irish market are required to provide documentation in Irish when a policy holder seeks to complete the proposal form in Irish.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are concerns about the cost of insurance in Ireland. Due to mergers and acquisitions in Ireland and in the European Union, the number of players in the insurance market is shrinking. This could have a detrimental impact on competition and price. I am, therefore, seeking to avoid any measures that might discourage new players coming into the Irish market. If there are more players and companies in Ireland, there will be greater competition and consumers will get better value. They will have greater choice of cover and the costs will be lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Ireland is an exporter of insurance services, our overall national interest does not lie in introducing new barriers to trade, but in supporting the free operation of the Single Market. The statistical data shows that the demand for this is very small and the law gives the client the right to seek to have the policy in Irish. This should be respected and it would be foolish to enshrine the amendment in the Bill because it could create difficulties and put Ireland into conflict with the European Commission. This might discourage companies from entering the market and we <Col N="536" /> should not create any hostages to fortune. I regret I am not able to accept this very positive proposal.</P>

      <P>When an insurance company fails to comply with the regulations it should be possible for the insurer to be disentitled to repudiate a contract in order that the consumer should not be disadvantaged. Furthermore, a provision should be in place to allow the court to decide whether it is in the interests of justice that the insurer can simply walk away without further responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 seeks to introduce an additional penalty for insurers who fail to comply with the disclosure regime, viz. that they would not be able to repudiate liability in respect of that contract of insurance, even if the insured had failed in his or her obligations. I am opposing this amendment because I fear that it would increase litigation and add to the costs borne by ordinary policy holders. In such cases it would presumably be necessary first to satisfy the court that a failure to comply had occurred. Moreover, in every case where an insurance company was attempting, for good reasons, to repudiate a claim, such a provision would encourage the invention of accusations of failure to comply. In other words, it would be underpinning allegations against companies. All this would have adverse consequences on the costs borne by ordinary policy holders. We could have many vexatious accusations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have some sympathy with the Deputy's point of view. It would appear that occasionally insurance companies use quite minor oversights by their clients to repudiate full responsibility in the event of a claim. This is one of a number of consumer issues which will merit further consideration once the Insurance Bill and the disclosure regulations are in place, and it is <Col N="538" /> something to which I propose to give attention within the Department.</P>

The establishment of a single regulator for financial services is causing great difficulty within the Government where a ding-dong battle is going on between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. This matter should be resolved, and eventually it will be. Deputy Upton's amendment has been tabled in the belief that the issue will be resolved by putting in place a financial services regulator. It is important that the financial services which the Bill proposes to regulate should come under the single regulator when that office is established. I support the amendment.</P>

The intention behind this amendment is to anticipate the appointment of a single regulator. This provision is unnecessary in the legislation. When the final decision has been taken on this issue, and if it requires legislation, it will not be difficult to transfer functions. Any legislation to this effect would, of course, be introduced by the Minister <Col N="539" /> for Finance. The House can be absolutely assured that the Tánaiste, on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Department of Finance, and the Attorney General, as the chief law officer of the State, have engaged themselves in this situation. An excellent report has been produced by the Attorney General. Officials in all three divisions of Government are working on this matter and we are confident we will achieve a consensus. It is important that we move forward carefully and deal with this complex issue in such a way that when it is introduced it will have the most profound effect on financial regulation.

      <P>In page 23, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 2 of the Act of 1995 is hereby amended in subsection (6) by the substitution of the following for paragraph (<i>h</i>):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(<i>h</i>) credit institutions which provide investment business services or investment advice.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 amends the definition of a credit institution to be found in the Act of 1995. The previous definition was ambiguous in that it was not clear whether credit institutions would be required to seek authorisation as investment business firms when acting as insurance intermediaries. This amendment removes that ambiguity by clarifying that authorised credit institutions will not have to seek authorisation. Subsequent amendments, which I propose, seek to apply to credit institutions provisions of the 1995 Act other than those relating to, or arising from, their authorised entities.</P>
      <P>There is no ambiguity about the disciplines which will apply to credit institutions. In other words, we are clarifying in law the definition of a credit institution. We are removing the ambiguity and we are ensuring that they do not have to seek authorisation, but we are enshrining in law the disciplines applying across this Bill to credit institutions. In particular, the disclosure provisions set out in section 7 will fully apply. In addition, I will also be proposing amendments the purpose of which is to ensure that the provisions of sections 29 and 30 of the 1995 Act will fully apply to all credit institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to speak to amendment No. 30, the purpose of which is to apply the provisions of section 30 of the Act of 1995 to credit institutions. <Col N="540" /> These provisions require an investment intermediary to issue a receipt to clients. This is an important provision which did not exist before. It is necessary to include explicitly credit institutions since, by virtue of the change in the definition of credit institutions, they are technically no longer investment business firms. I hope to move amendment No. 30 later.</P>

      <P>In page 26, to delete lines 15 to 22.</P>
      <P>I propose to speak to amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23. The amendment which is being discussed separately, amendment No. 29, inserts new provisions in place of previous provisions in the 1995 Act. The effect of the new provisions is to provide that the information to be provided by intermediaries to clients on their stationery or in advertisements or on first contact with clients will be set out in regulations. This was not done before. This will allow the supervisory authority to take account of the sometimes complex status of intermediaries while ensuring the information to clients is clear and unambiguous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 29 of the 1995 Act in its current form as inserted by section 26 of the Bill could cause <Col N="541" /> confusion. For example, an insurance intermediary will be required to inform the client when first entering into a business relationship and state on its stationery and business forms his or her insurance intermediary category, whether it does life insurance or non-life insurance business or both. Where that insurance intermediary is also a restricted activity product investment intermediary, it must also state on its stationery and on first entering a business relationship with a client that it cannot accept cash. For such an intermediary to comply with all these disclosure requirements may confuse rather than protect clients. Accordingly, in the redrafted section 29 of the 1995 Act, the broad principles which should underpin such disclosure are set out. The supervisory authority is provided with the power to make appropriate regulations of there being such principles while providing clear disclosure of the intermediaries' status to the client.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 delete provisions that will now be encompassed in the new section 29. Amendment No. 23 renumbers paragraphs to take account of a deletion and it is purely a technical amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="542" />&ldquo;(iv) by the substitution of the following for clause (I):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(I) taking cash payment for the collection of outstanding premiums billed by a company as defined under the insurance Acts, and'&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 was tabled on Committee Stage and the Minister said he would examine it and return on Report Stage. It comes back to the debate on the definition of cash handlers and non-cash handlers and the RAIPI and IPI designation of a broker. We debated the need for brokers to be able to accept cash.</P>
    <P>I have tabled amendment No. 25 which Deputy Perry proposed on Committee Stage. It is an alternative to amendment No. 24 and it allows the Minister of State to consider the collection of outstanding premiums which have been billed by a company. That would allow a broker to collect moneys to ensure policies do not lapse. That provides additional protection for clients by ensuring premia are kept up to date so that they do not lose out. There is benefit for both brokers and people who have taken out policies.</P>
    <P>I know representative groups have discussed this with the Minister of State and have suggested another amendment related to the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which would allow for £700 per annum for annual or regular premium life policies and £1,750 for single premium life policies. I do not mind which of my amendments the Minister of State is prepared to accept but it is important for the protection of the consumer and to ensure that policies are kept up to date so that the consumer does not lose out because the policy is not paid up that one of them is accepted. We highlighted a number of instances on Committee Stage where such situations can arise.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would also examine another situation regarding what happens where an elderly person in a rural community has a broker or intermediary calling to his or her house. I highlighted a specific instance. I do not see an amendment tabled to deal with that, but perhaps the Minister of State would review that position. Perhaps he would also look sympathetically on these amendments.</P>

I am satisfied the posi<Col N="543" /> tion of the client is secured in the circumstances envisaged since the insurance company will be standing behind the intermediary and, given that we have made it explicit in this legislation that receipts must be issued, that binds the insurance company into underwriting, protecting and standing behind the intermediary.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment which replaces a text which would have been ineffective because it was expressed in negative terms. The amendment describes circumstances in which a restricted activity investment product intermediary may not be deemed authorised for the purposes of the 1995 Act. The original drafting of this provision was very negative. We examined the wording and put forward this amendment to clarify the position so it will have a binding and understandable effect which is obvious to the consumer, the industry and all those who deal with the insurance business.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 30, line 34, after &ldquo;bonds&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, tracker bonds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment which inserts the words &ldquo;tracker bonds&rdquo; in section 28 of the 1995 Act. This is intended to ensure symmetry between the definition of an investment product intermediary and the products which producers are authorised to offer through such intermediaries.</P>
      <P>In section 25 of the 1995 Act, an investment product intermediary is defined as someone who may offer tracker bonds among other products. Section 28 of the 1995 Act lists the products which a product producer may entrust to an investment product intermediary but tracker bonds are not included. We discussed this issue at official level and have tabled this amendment as it is important to remedy this anomaly.</P>

      <P>This is a valid amendment. Tracker bonds are a relatively new product and that is why they were not included in the 1995 Act. I may be contradicting an earlier point I made but what will happen if a new product emerges and brokers are restricted from selling it because it is not specified in the 1995 Act? Can <Col N="545" /> we introduce regulations to protect brokers so they can provide the additional service?</P>
      <P>Banks are pulling out of many towns such as Mount Bellew in the Minister of State's constituency and Strokestown in my constituency, and abdicating their traditional responsibility to communities. Banks provided some of these services and would have provided new services in the future. Brokers or investment intermediaries may not be able to provide these services and banks will not be available to local communities so people will not be able to avail of services such as new types of tracker bonds. Is there any flexibility to allow us to provide for new products as they emerge?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is such flexibility. Most new products are variations of existing products and on that basis can be deemed to be included in this legislation. We have to take account of the growth in the national and international economies. The insurance industry responds to the opportunity provided by growth in the economy and creates new products. We will have to accept that such new products are deemed to be included but we can amend the regulations at any time if necessary. We would also have to consider amending legislation if necessary. We cannot create impediments to the regulation or operation of positive, practical investment opportunities for citizens or groups so we must be prepared to respond to that opportunity. Any new products are deemed to be included.</P>

      <P>The legislation covers bonds, tracker bonds and various other products. The word &ldquo;bond&rdquo; in any new bond would deem it to be included. However, if a totally new product is introduced which has a serious effect on regulation we might have to consider legislation. By and large any new product is deemed to be included. It may be necessary to introduce legislation in certain cases. However, this could be achieved through the Finance Bill so we would not be caught up in the insurance legislation. The House is obliged to pass an annual Finance Bill to implement the provisions of the budget so it could include an amendment in this regard.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;26.&ndash;The Act of 1995 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 29:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;29.&ndash;The supervisory authority may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, require investment product intermediaries or any class or classes of such intermediaries (including credit institutions when acting as such intermediaries) to disclose in communications (including advertisements) made by them in any form or manner (including electronic communications) and on first entering into an investment business service relationship with a client one or more of the following:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) that it is not within their terms of authorisation to accept cash or other funds or securities on behalf of their clients or to act on a discretionary basis in the management of client funds,</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to amend the 1995 Act by inserting provisions relating to disclosure to clients on first contact and will apply, for example, to advertisements and letterheads. The new section 29 establishes the principles which should underpin such disclosure and provides that detailed application will be determined in regulations. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that disclosure to clients is clear, practical and intelligible.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to oppose section 27. I raised this issue on Committee Stage. The amendment relates to tour operators and arises because of the need for equality of treatment and equivalence. Why should there be one rule for tour operators and another for brokers? Both provide a similar travel insurance service, the only difference being that a broker provides such insurance on an annual basis while a tour operator provides it on the basis of individual journeys. However, the commissions can vary dramatically between the two. Tour operators can charge up to 35% commission whereas brokers charge somewhat less. There should be equality of treatment. I oppose this section because there should be equality of treatment between the tour operators and the brokers. We teased out this on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the proposed amendment would be to include tour operators and travel agents within the scope of Part IV of the 1995 Act, thus requiring these tour operators and travel agents to be authorised by the Central Bank as intermediaries. They are not investment intermediaries.</P>
      <P>Travel agents are subject to a regime of supervision and indemnity bonding which covers their activities in relation to travel insurance in accordance with the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982. That important legislation was introduced in response to the serious crisis at the time in the travel operators' business internationally which was having a detrimental effect on consumers here. There is, therefore, no necessity to apply the supervisory provisions of the 1995 Act, the fundamental purpose of which was to ensure intermediaries could meet their financial obligations to their clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something to which I have given a great deal of consideration. It is a matter for the industry to be certain in its publicity, advertising and promotion that there is a choice available to consumers <i>vis-à-vis</i> travel insurance from the industry itself through its intermediaries, brokers and agents, as distinct from the fact that the travel and tour operators obviously must ensure their customers are insured before they leave the country. It would be inadvisable to impose this <Col N="548" /> because we would then include tour operators and travel agents as investment intermediaries, and they are certainly not that. If we were to go down that road, it would have serious consequences. I regret I am not able to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has failed to address the point, which I am trying to highlight and which I highlighted on Committee Stage, that we are talking about disclosure of commission in investment intermediaries and brokers but we are not talking about disclosure in this case for tour operators. Why should one set of individuals who sell travel insurance be treated differently? If brokers must disclose the percentage commission they receive on travel insurance, surely tour operators should have to do likewise. It comes back to the issue of equality and equivalence and the issue of disclosure, which is the purpose of the Bill. I do not understand why the same provision cannot apply to tour operators and I would urge the Minister of State to reconsider his decision.</P>

I understand what Deputy Naughten is trying to achieve and I want to go as far as I can to achieve it. My interpretation is that only Part IV of the 1995 Act does not apply to travel agents and tour operators and the Department believes the disclosure regulations and the code of conduct rules apply to them. I will have another look at that between now and the debate on the Bill in the Seanad. I will copper-fasten in my mind what is the <i>de facto</i> situation.

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 33, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;30.&ndash;Section 37 of the Act of 1995 is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (2):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" />&lsquo;(2A) Provisions relating to the disclosure of commissions that are included, pursuant to paragraph (<i>e</i>) of subsection (1) of this section, in a code of conduct drawn up under that subsection shall not apply to investment business firms in so far as they are acting as insurance intermediaries.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee State I stated that on Report Stage I would introduce an amendment to section 37 of the 1995 Act. Section 37 provides that the supervisory authority shall draw up a code of conduct which sets out how investment business firms are to behave regarding their clients. Broadly, they are to act in the best interests of their clients and to disclose specified information to their clients. These provisions apply to all intermediaries, including when they are acting as insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>One of the requirements of the code is that commissions should be disclosed. However, a rigorous regime of disclosure is provided for in section 7 of the Bill, which would take precedence in any case. This amendment excludes intermediaries from the requirement to disclose commission when they sell insurance since they must disclose commission payments under the disclosure regulations. All other provisions of the code apply to them.</P>
    <P>In other words, they will disclose commissions under the disclosure regulations. We will not oblige them to disclose them a second time. That would be unfair and unnecessary. It would create another layer of bureaucracy in the documentation which is not necessary. On disclosing commission once, they will have disclosed their legal obligation. That is only fair.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that where an intermediary fails to comply with the requirements of section 26, the supervisory authority shall have access to the powers set out in section 74 of the 1995 Act. In other words, we are tying the two Acts together and that gives the supervisory authority the absolute power where the intermediary has failed to comply with the requirements of section 26.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 33, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;33.&ndash;Section 31 of the Act of 1995 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6)(<i>b</i>) of the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(<i>c</i>) Notwithstanding paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of this subsection, the supervisory authority may dispense with the require<Col N="550" /> ment to ensure the publication of a notice of discontinuance where the investment product intermediary satisfies it that such publication may be detrimental to the orderly and good conduct of its business or may undermine the confidence of clients in the investment product intermediary or for other good reasons.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I highlighted on Committee Stage, there is concern among brokers that the requirement to publish a notice of discontinuance where a product producer terminates an intermediary's appointment may lead to hardship. This is the most common reason for the termination of business. Brokers believe that the publication of the notice may lead to customers erroneously concluding wrongdoing on the part of the intermediary. This error may lead to the loss of business. The supervisory authority should be given the power to dispense with the publication where the intermediary has shown good cause.</P>
    <P>While accepting fully the Minister's point that there should be such a publication in some circumstances, it would be detrimental to the business of investment intermediaries if this was the case in every circumstances. It is to allow for the flexibility I described on Committee Stage that this would not be an automatic procedure. We who come from rural Ireland are realists and we know what happens when information like this is published in the newspapers and the bush telegraph starts working overtime. In such cases the story grows arms and legs and goes out of control. No matter what one does at that stage, the business of the intermediary involved could be destroyed as a result. What is needed is a little flexibility in the system. Wrongdoing should be published but where there is a valid argument not to publish, the legislation should allow for flexibility. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, as Deputy Naughten has clearly outlined, is to dispense with the need to publish discontinuance notices at the agreement of the supervisor. I understand the motive for the amendment and the sincerity of the case made by Deputy Naughten. Discontinuance of appointments may occur for perfectly ordinary reasons and yet notices may give the wrong impression of the intermediary. However, intermediaries may themselves publish the notice of discontinuance explaining the innocuous reasons for it, if they so choose. On the other hand, the purpose of the requirement is to publish so that consumers can be fully informed. Providing such information to consumers is obviously of overriding importance. Accordingly, I regret that if I was to allow any leeway in this situation, the consumer could be the victim at the end of the day. I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State made the point that the intermediary, when publishing the <Col N="551" /> advertisement, would give the reasoning behind it. What is to stop the intermediary, no matter what the wrongdoing, from putting in an innocuous statement as the reason for discontinuance? It is a valid point, especially in rural Ireland, that this flexibility is provided and that there is a supervisory authority which would decide whether publication has to take place so that a line does not have to be drawn on every occasion.</P>
      <P>I am not happy there is enough protection for the intermediary if there is a genuine reason for discontinuance rather than because of wrongdoing. In the majority of cases where discontinuance takes place, there is a genuine reason for it and it is not because of wrongdoing. We are talking about a small number of cases of wrongdoing and, hopefully, it will continue along those lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from where Deputy Naughten is coming but if wrongdoing is the test, who will be the arbiter and who will prove it? Will it be the supervisor, the insurance company, the courts or the intermediary? How will we have a <i>de facto</i> conclusion of the situation to allow publication to proceed if we use wrongdoing as a test? That would be a very dangerous situation. If I, as an intermediary, am accused of doing something wrong, I have the right of redress, the right to go to the courts. I can file an injunction and a defence in court. That could take one to three years to hear. However, if I am out of business and somebody has replaced me, the consumers will not be sure whether I am in or out. The new person will be asked where Mr. X, Mr. Y or Mrs. Z has gone? How will we prove the case?</P>
      <P>It is better to be clear, to keep it simple and to ensure we have notification. The right is there for the intermediary to add to and to qualify that notification and to publish their own notification, if they so wish. At the end of the day, that is in the best interest of the intermediary and the consumer and it keeps the matter simple, which legislation and politics should always try to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I come back to the point again, we are not talking about wrongdoing where it has to be proven. We are talking about the opposite, that is, where there is a genuine reason for discontinuance, publication should not have to take place. We are not talking about where wrongdoing has to be proven or saying that publication must take place. I fully agree with the point the Minister of State made in relation to that but I am talking about the opposite. Where there is a genuine reason for discontinuance, that should be provided for and everybody should not be treated in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What protection is there where somebody who is involved in wrongdoing has to publish or give notice of their discontinuance but gives a reason other than the wrongdoing? No one will be any the wiser in that situation. That does not protect the consumer because they could buy a product <Col N="552" /> from that individual who may be with another company or an intermediary for another company. That is a disadvantage for the consumer because they will not be aware of any wrongdoing. To ensure transparency and that the section achieves what the Minister of State wants it to achieve, where there is a case of wrongdoing I urge him to consider the amendment.</P>

In order to protect the community from the ravages of drug abuse, Customs is one of the main agencies responsible for preventing the drugs from reaching their intended users. This has been achieved by seizing drug shipments and disrupting the supply network at borders. The main customs area of expertise lies in exercising controls over the movement of goods and persons into and out of a country. Drug shipments, drug couriers and the traffickers themselves are at their most vulnerable when moving across borders. Similar principles apply to the smuggling of fiscal goods such as tobacco and alcohol where there also has been a rapidly increasing involvement by the international criminal fraternity.</P>
    <P>Through the use of intelligence, profiling and risk analysis techniques, customs administrations have remained effective in seizing drugs and other smuggled products in the face of rapidly expanding international trade, travel and transportation. To be fully effective, law enforcement agencies generally, both at domestic and international levels, need an integrated approach to tackle all of the dimensions to trans-national crime.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, with the advent of the Single Market, the Customs National Drugs Team, CNDT, was set up within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in December 1992. Dedicated to drugs work only, the CNDT comprises 85 staff and consists of a head office located in Dublin and intelligence units, operational units, maritime units and drug detector dog units which are strategically placed at coastal locations nationwide. The CNDT is backed up by some 640 outfield customs officials who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drugs smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
    <P>A Memorandum of Understanding &ndash; MOU &ndash; was signed on 12 January 1996, between An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners, which provides a framework to facilitate greater co-operation and allow for operational and liaison structures including a joint task force. The function of the joint task force, which has representation from the Naval Service, is to deal with intelligence-driven drug operations and controlled deliveries of drugs, with each participant agency bringing its individual expertise and competence into play. There have been a number of joint task force controlled deliveries which have resulted in the seizure of a substantial quantity of drugs and the arrest of suspects.</P>
    <P>The CNDT has had continual liaison with the Criminal Assets Bureau since its inception. Formal exchange of information and intelligence by both agencies is governed by the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996 and the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996. Intelligence and information exchanged has included details of drug and cash seizures made from individuals and the property of individuals involved in, or suspected to be involved in drug smuggling. Assistance has also <Col N="555" /> been given in a number of instances to monitor the movements of certain individuals into and out of the country. I am particularly pleased that intelligence and information provided by CNDT has assisted in some of the CAB's major successes.</P>
    <P>One other important matter is the Memoranda of Understanding Programme. This is a national initiative through which the co-operation and assistance of trade associations as well as individual companies involved in the movement of goods and persons has been enlisted by the Customs Service to deal with the drugs problem. Since the signing of the first Memorandum of Understanding in June 1993, some 41 agreements have been successfully concluded, encompassing almost 6,000 diverse companies. This list is steadily increasing. A number of MOUs are currently under active negotiation with major trade interests. MOUs are aimed at heightening the awareness of employees of airlines, shipping companies, freight forwarders and others engaged in international trade and carriage, to the dangers of drugs smuggling and provide them with ready channels of communications with the CNDT. I pay tribute to those traders and their staff who are actively involved in the programme and assure them that their contribution is a very valued one.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give the force of law in Ireland to two international conventions concerning co-operation and sharing of information relating to customs issues, prior to this country adopting them at European Union level. The member states of the Union are required to adopt these conventions in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. It is also proposed to give a number of related instruments the force of law. The Bill itself, therefore, is comparatively short. For ease of reference, the conventions and related instruments are appended to the Bill in both English and Irish, the texts being equally authentic in both languages. Before turning to the detail of the individual sections, I propose to give the background to the two conventions and related instruments.</P>
    <P>The Convention on the use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes &ndash; the CIS Convention &ndash; was signed by all EU member states on 26 July 1995. This convention provides for the establishment of a &ldquo;Customs Information System&rdquo;. Put simply, this is a computerised central database, with terminals in each member state linked to the central database, allowing for the rapid dissemination of information and intelligence about illegal movements over internal frontiers so that effective action can be taken by customs administrations to combat smuggling, including drugs smuggling. As this database will be used to disseminate information in all areas of customs concern, a dual legal basis is necessary. To the extent that the database covers information about possible breaches of Community law, it is underpinned by Council Regulation <Col N="556" /> (EC) No. 515/97. In so far as it deals with information concerning goods such as drugs &ndash; an area not within Community competence &ndash; the legal basis is the CIS Convention. The database will carry information on commodities, means of transport, businesses, persons, fraud trends and availability of expertise. Customs administrations may use the database to pass on information about suspect movements, to carry out discreet surveillance or specific checks and to report the results to the other customs administrations concerned.</P>
    <P>The CIS Convention generally limits access to and use of data on the database to nominated national authorities and obliges them to take the necessary measures to protect the security of the data. Member states are required to have national law in place giving a level of protection to data which is at least equal to that in the 1981 Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection. The 1988 Data Protection Act gave effect to that convention in this country. The CIS Convention contains specific limits to the data which may be included on the database and individuals have the right to access data about themselves, to have data checked, corrected or deleted and to have their rights vindicated in the courts. The CIS Convention also provides for independent supervision of data to protect the rights of individuals. Each member state is responsible in accordance with its national law for any injury caused through the use of the database in its territory, including injury arising from inaccurate data supplied by another member state or data supplied by another member state, which should not have been included on the database. Where injury is caused as a result of data provided by another member state, the apportionment of liability will be subject to agreement between the states concerned. The CIS Convention also lays down an elaborate framework for the management and supervision of the database. I will deal with this point in more detail when speaking about specific sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to the CIS Convention, there are three related instruments to which this Bill gives legal effect. These are the Agreement on Provisional Application of the Convention and two protocols. The Agreement on Provisional Application allows the CIS Convention to be applied by some but not all the member states in an interim period until such time as all are in a position to adopt it. It was signed by the same date as the convention itself. This arrangement recognised that certain member states would have to introduce legislation to give effect to certain provisions in the CIS convention before they could adopt it.</P>
    <P>The current position is that eight member states have adopted the agreement and it is due to come into operation for those countries in December 2000. The CIS Convention confers jurisdiction on the European Court of Justice to rule on disputes between member states and between member states and the Commission, <Col N="557" /> regarding the application of the convention. However, at the time the CIS Convention was signed, there was no agreement between member states on what role, if any, the European Court should have relating to interpretation of the convention.</P>
    <P>A compromise was worked out subsequently, resulting in a protocol to the CIS Convention being drawn up which enabled each member state to accept a role for the European Court on an opt-in basis. Ireland signed the protocol subject to adoption on 29 November 1996. The protocol confers jurisdiction on the European Court to interpret the convention but makes its application by national court conditional on the declaration to be made at the time of signature or at any time thereafter to the effect that the member states will accept the European Court's jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of the convention. Member states which are prepared to accept the European Court's jurisdiction may specify, in relation to the application of the CIS convention, whether courts or tribunals against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under their national law, or all their national courts or tribunals, will be in a position to ask the European Court for preliminary rulings.</P>
    <P>In view of the serious difficulties that could arise under our legal system if criminal trials had to be suspended for lengthy periods while rulings were obtained from the European Court, Ireland made a declaration at the time of signing the Protocol to the effect that it would agree to give only those courts or tribunals against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law the right to request a preliminary ruling from the European Court on the interpretation of the CIS Convention. This reflected Ireland's position on similar jurisdiction provisions in other EU Conventions such as the Europol Convention. The practical effect of this will be that only cases before the Supreme Court will be forwarded to the European Court for preliminary ruling.</P>
    <P>On 12 March 1999 a Second Protocol to the CIS Convention was signed, subject to adoption, which remedied two deficiencies that had been identified in that convention. The first related to the items of information which could be placed on the database. Member states' customs administrations could not include on the database the registration number of the means of transport of smuggled goods even though this additional data element could be very useful. The second deficiency related to the information which could be placed on the database in connection with money laundering. While the CIS Convention provided for an exchange of information on money laundering in connection with illicit international drug trafficking, it did not provide for exchanges of information on money laundering which was related to other types of infringements of Community and national customs laws. In the interests of ensuring a comprehensive response to all types of smuggling, the Protocol extended the circumstances in which information on money <Col N="558" /> laundering could be exchanged using the database.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also concerned with the Convention on Mutual Assistance and Co-operation between customs administrations, known more simply as the Customs Co-operation Convention, which was signed by all member states on 18 December 1997, subject to adoption. On its accession to the EEC in 1973, Ireland became a party to the 1967 Naples Convention. That convention has been for over 30 years the principal legal instrument available for the provision of mutual assistance allowing customs administrations to exchange useful information and intelligence along with assisting in the investigation of breaches of customs law including smuggling of, for example, prohibited goods such as drugs, arms and ammunition. By the early 1990s member states decided that the Naples Convention was in need of revision so that customs administrations would have the means to tackle cross-border smuggling activities effectively in the context of a Single Market without internal frontiers. As a result, the updated Customs Co-operation Convention was concluded under Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union. The Customs Co-operation Convention updates provisions in the Naples Convention but also extends its scope, in particular in provides for special forms of co-operation between customs administrations not existing heretofore.</P>
    <P>Customs administrations, in applying the provisions of the Customs Co-operation Convention, must act in accordance with their national legislative powers. Formal requests for assistance must be channelled through a specific contact point in each member state. In providing assistance in response to requests, which normally must be in writing, the requested administration must act as if the request had emanated from within its own country. In certain circumstances, officials from the applicant administration may visit the offices of the requested member state to obtain further information. The requested administration can be asked to carry out surveillance on suspect persons and on means of transport, goods and places. A representative of the applicant administration may be present when action is carried out by the requested administration, provided both administrations agree.</P>
    <P>Information received under the convention must be treated as confidential and used only for the purposes specified in the convention. It can also be used as evidence in the receiving member state in accordance with national law. Data protection provisions in the convention are similar to those in the CIS Convention.</P>
    <P>As regards the special forms of co-operation provided for in the convention, these provisions enable customs administrations to engage in special forms of co-operation in respect of certain types of infringements such as cases involving illicit traffic in drugs, weapons, munitions and serious cases of smuggling taxable goods. These special forms of co-operation are hot pursuit, <Col N="559" /> cross-border surveillance, controlled delivery, covert investigations and joint special investigation teams. These provisions would allow customs officers of one State to enter another State to carry out or continue their activities.</P>
    <P>However, the convention allows member states to opt out of applying some of these provisions, that is, hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance and covert investigations. The other provisions are mandatory. The Government proposes to avail of the opt out provision and will make a declaration to this effect when Ireland lodges its instruments of adoption of the convention. Other member states, including the United Kingdom, are also availing of the opt out provisions. If the considerations which led the Government to take this approach should alter in the future, the Bill provides that the Government may, by order, opt in to some or all of the provisions.</P>
    <P>The Customs Co-operation Convention confers jurisdiction on the European Court of Justice to rule on disputes regarding its application between member states and between members states and the Commission. In common with the Protocol to the CIS Convention, it also confers jurisdiction on the court to interpret the convention but makes the application of this provision by the courts in each member state conditional on a declaration to be made at the time of signature, or any time thereafter, to the effect that the member state will accept the court's jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of the convention. Ireland will make a similar declaration on this matter as for the CIS Convention, for the same reasons that I outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>An important point is that a request for assistance under the convention may be refused where it is considered to be prejudicial to public policy or other essential interests and rights of the member state concerned, particularly in the field of data protection or where the action requested is disproportionate to the gravity of the presumed offence. Reasons must be given for any such refusal.</P>
    <P>Both conventions are to enter into force 90 days after the last of the member states has adopted them. The agreement to provisionally apply the CIS Convention is to enter into force 90 days after the eighth member state has adopted it. Adoption of this agreement by those eight States will allow the CIS Convention to be applied provisionally subject to certain conditions specified in the agreement. The position is that eight member states have adopted the agreement and it is due to come into operation for those countries in December. Both the Protocol dealing with the role of the European Court of Justice and the Second Protocol dealing with deficiencies in the CIS Convention are also to enter into force 90 days after the last of the member states has adopted them but cannot be implemented during the period of provisional application of the CIS Convention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> I do not propose to spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with the provisions of the Bill since the Explanatory Memorandum, which was circulated with it, contains quite a detailed commentary on the individual sections and their provisions in the conventions and related instruments. As I have already mentioned, the purpose of the Bill is to give the conventions and related instruments the force of law in the State. Section 2 contains this core provision.</P>
    <P>Section 3 designates the Revenue Commissioners as the national authority for the purposes of certain articles of the CIS Convention. This means that, in Ireland, direct access to the database will be exercised by the Revenue Commissioners. The infrastructure for this system is already available with 20 terminals based at, among other locations, customs offices in ports and airports around the country.</P>
    <P>Section 4 designates the Revenue Commissioners as the competent customs administration for the purposes of Article 10 of the CIS Convention. That article requires each member state to designate a competent customs administration to take responsibility for the correct operation of the database within the member state and to ensure compliance with the provisions of the convention.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 9 are concerned with data protection. The main purpose of section 5 is to apply the Data Protection Act, 1988, to relevant provisions in the conventions and related instruments, subject to modification where necessary. As I have already mentioned, the 1988 Act gave effect to the principles contained in the 1981 Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection which is the standard of protection laid down in respect of automated data in both of the conventions to which the Bill is giving legal effect.</P>
    <P>Section 6 designates the Data Protection Commissioner for the purposes of the conventions, so that he will be empowered to monitor implementation of the data protection provisions in respect of automated data.</P>
    <P>Section 9 creates an offence under the 1988 Act for the improper use of data on the database. Penalties for such offences are to be the same as those set out in section 31 of the 1988 Act, namely a fine not exceeding £1,000 or 1,270 euro on summary conviction, or a fine not exceeding £50,000 or 63,487 euro on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>I would point out that all of these sections deal only with automated data, that is, data which is processed automatically. I will deal later with the question of protecting non-automated or manual data.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the special forms of co-operation set out in the Customs Co-operation Convention. The convention provides for five special forms of co-operation. I have mentioned already that while two of these forms of co-operation are mandatory, member states may decide to opt out of the others. Therefore, while this Act will give the force of law to the convention, it is necessary to specify in the Act itself that this <Col N="561" /> country shall not be bound by those provisions from which the opt-out is being exercised.</P>
    <P>If those considerations giving rise to Ireland opting out were to change at any point in the future and it was desired to avail of these provisions, this would require legislation to amend subsection 1 of this section. However, by providing in subsection 2 for possible opt-in later by way of Government order, the necessity of having to enact amending legislation is avoided. A draft of any such order would have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and could not be made until a resolution approving of such draft had been passed by each such House in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 11 contain provisions for the making of ministerial regulations, which may appear to be necessary and expedient for carrying out the purposes of the Bill and for these to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. While the Bill does not specifically require the making of regulations in relation to any particular aspect of its provisions, it may be necessary at a later stage to consider the making of regulations if it emerges that there is a need to give effect to protection of personal data exchanged by non-automated means. Therefore, I am making specific provision for that purpose since, as I mentioned earlier, the existing national data protection legislation only applies to automated exchanges of data. Other than in the case of that specific issue, the purpose of these sections is merely to enable incidental requirements to be met from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the interpretation of both the CIS and customs co-operation conventions by the European Court of Justice by way of preliminary rulings and for judicial notice to be taken of such rulings.</P>
    <P>I have outlined already how both the 1996 protocol to the CIS convention and the Customs Co-operation Convention provide that member states may, by way of declaration, accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of the conventions. As a further measure, those member states that accept the court's jurisdiction must declare whether they will allow all of their national courts, or only those from whose decision there is no avenue of appeal, to seek such preliminary rulings. At the time of signature of both instruments, Ireland decided on the latter option in both cases so as to ensure there will be as little disruption as possible to the progress of a criminal trial once it has commenced.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying that the measures being introduced by this Bill are very sensible. The two conventions and related instruments represent a comprehensive package of measures to enhance the present co-operation arrangements to assist customs administrations in preventing serious smuggling, illegal cross-frontier movement of illicit substances and products and generally in improving controls. There is a very solid foundation going back over 30 years on <Col N="562" /> which we are now building and I am confident these measures will also stand the test of time. The value of international co-operation between customs administrations has been well illustrated over the years.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will be found acceptable by all sides of the House. Of course, I shall give careful consideration to the points which Deputies may make and to any suggestions for amendment that may be made in the course of the debate. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for introducing this Bill, which Fine Gael welcomes and which we will be supporting on Second Stage. We will not table many amendments on Committee Stage but we will give the Bill the usual scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The Bill is principally dealing with the adoption of the EU convention on customs information systems and goes on to legislate for the provisional application of the convention. There are also two protocols to the convention which change the interpretation of key sections. A separate convention is also being adopted on mutual assistance and co-operation between customs administrations.</P>
      <P>It is a useful Bill and will lead to a strengthening of the potential of customs and excise officials to combat international crime. We are pleased with it for that reason. All of us in Ireland have engaged in debates on the defence of Europe at various times. Some people talk about the defence of Europe as if defence and security were synonymous terms. However, after the Cold War conflicts and those in the Balkans, the issues facing Europe in the future will not be competing ideologies or internal or border wars but will be the issues relating to security and the threats posed to citizens of Europe by international terrorism and drug smuggling in its various manifestations, including the marketing of drugs, the money laundering of the proceeds and the acquisition of assets through the use of laundered money. Anything which strengthens the customs and excise officials in their fight against organised crime is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>It is also true that since the end of the Cold War and the conflicts in the Balkans, the incidence of mafia type organised international crime has increased significantly. It has been a by-product of the democratisation of eastern Europe and the introduction of the free market there. Crime is the ultimate free market activity. Mafias from Russia, Romania and other eastern European countries are operating throughout western Europe and have magnified the problems posed by organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the availability of weaponry for terrorism and violent crime, western Europe is now littered with the remnants of the armaments of armies. When the Russians moved east after the arrangement was made on the unification of Germany, it was quite common for large amounts of armaments to be passed into the black market <Col N="563" /> by the retreating Russian army. These are now freely available. The various wars in Yugoslavia have led to a similar availability of armaments. Very heavy weaponry and a multiplicity of armaments are now available for crime and lawlessness throughout western Europe and Ireland is not free from this.</P>
    <P>We had experience in the past, when the provisional IRA campaign was raging, of guns and Semtex coming in from Libya. However, these originated in the Russian satellite states, with much of the Semtex coming from the Czech Republic and many of the Kalashnikov rifles coming from Slovakia. They were channelled through various ways into Ireland.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State that any set of international agreements which positions us better to cut off the trade in illegal drugs, which is prevalent in this country, and which reduces the possibility of quasi-republican dissident groups importing the arms which are freely available across Europe, is to be welcomed in this House. I wish the customs and excise officials every success in their efforts.</P>
    <P>The CIS convention allows for the establishment of computerised central databases, with terminals in each member state, and the inclusion on the databases of very significant information relevant to areas which concern organised crime. Areas such as commodities, means of transport, businesses, names of persons, fraud trends and so on will be included in the database. The database would be constantly updated and the flow of information would be available in each of the member countries, including Ireland. This is important given that traffic through Dublin Airport is in excess of 14 million persons per annum, and ferries, cars, wagons, trucks and articulated trucks and so on come in all the time. We are not free from this. The experience of all Deputies is that the drug problem in Ireland is no longer confined to the major cities. There are major incidents in drugs even in small country villages. When one comes to know the families involved and the parents of the young people being arrested for the possession and trade in heavy drugs one realises this is widespread. There is a certain amount of closing our eyes to how widespread the drug problem is in Ireland. It is an international trade and one which has to be combatted domestically by the best efforts of the Garda Síochána and the customs officials but it must be combatted internationally as well because it is internationally organised.</P>
    <P>When the Criminal Assets Bureau cracked down on organised crime in this city after the murder of Veronica Guerin many of the drug barons pulled up stakes and headed for Amsterdam where they seem to be living the life of millionaires. They could not have done so if their activities had not previously been internationalised and there was a ready safe haven for them in Europe. I fully approve of our ratification of the convention because it is important to co-operate <Col N="564" /> with the efforts being made to combat what I think will be the great threat to Europe for this generation &ndash; the threat from organised crime, the threat from the organised drug trade and the threat to our young people and also the possibility of further trade in armaments, guns, ammunition and explosives coming from the kind of people who caused the Omagh atrocity</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the customs information system will also be used to disseminate information in all areas of customs concern and will not be confined solely to the exchange of information about drugs and other sensitive goods. The Minister has not said this anywhere in his speech. Does this mean that customs and excise will be involved in exchanging information on the movement of emigrants across Europe? Is traffic in people included in this convention? If so, serious issues arise. While the primary responsibility in respect of emigrants lies with the immigration authorities, frequently customs and excise seem to be involved at the ports. At times it is difficult to distinguish who has responsibility if an articulated truck is coming into Ireland with six Romanian refugees. Is that solely an immmigration issue or a customs and excise issue? It is certainly a customs issue in many other European countries. This situation needs to be handled sensitively. The movement of especially the poor and deprived, for economic reasons or for reasons of seeking asylum because of persecution at home, is not equivalent to the international trade in drugs or international trade in armaments. Given that we are dealing with human beings we should be far more sensitive about it. The paragraph in the explanatory memorandum which states that the convention will not be confined solely to the exchange of information about drugs and other sensitive goods is not a diplomatic way of telling us it will be used for emigrants as well.</P>
    <P>I have heard horrific stories of emigrants at the channel ports specifically in France. I have met Irish lorry drivers who told me if they stop at a café on the way to Dover they have to check the truck when they come out. There are various security forces other than the <i>gendarmerie</i> who use Alsatian dogs and tear gas grenades to flush people out of the back of articulated trucks at the general ports. We all know the difficulties. We also realise that emigration will be one of the great issues in Europe for the foreseeable future and will increase rather than decrease. I hope that a convention which is being put in place for one stated purpose will not be used in a way which will diminish the human rights of those who seek to leave their own country for reasons of seeking political asylum or to better themselves by establishing a new life in one of the richer economies.</P>
    <P>The convention on mutual assistance and co-operation between customs administrations is also welcomed by my party. The provision is for mutual assistance and it allows the customs authorities to exchange useful information and intelligence in the investigation of breaches of customs <Col N="565" /> law, including, for example, the smuggling of prohibited goods such as drugs, armaments and ammunition. This has not simply to do with putting information on a database. According to the explanatory memorandum it would allow member states to co-operate to the extent of agreeing to hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance, control delivery, covert investigations, joint special investigation teams. While opt out clauses are provided for, will the Minister clearly explain Ireland's position? Are we opting out or will the convention enable our customs officials to bring people from, say, the United Kingdom to Athlone to get involved in a joint surveillance activity? Will it allow hot pursuit across the Border from Newry to Dundalk if the customs officials think drugs are being imported from Northern Ireland? Will covert investigations involve the use of customs or excise officials from other European countries operating here? Certainly the convention would allow that to happen. Will the Minister make it clear if this is theory or if he envisages it being put into practice in Ireland? If it is not going to be put into practice, will he rely on the inertia of the system or implement the opt out clause which is available to him?</P>
    <P>On two occasions recently we have had reference to the FBI assisting the Garda Síochána in joint operations. At the Abbeylara shooting the FBI seemed to be present in some kind of advisory capacity. More recently we were regaled by a series of dawn raids in the Limerick and Shannon area where factories, warehouses and private houses were entered forcibly by a joint FBI-Garda operation. They were in pursuit of aeroplane parts which would not have been manufactured by the reputable aircraft construction companies. These replica aircraft parts which may not be up to standard were in question. Local folklore is that they found nothing. The search was conducted in a high profile way with private houses being forcibly entered at the crack of dawn and doors being knocked down. In one instance a warehouse where the manager produced the key had its door knocked down because it was more dramatic to knock the door in than to open it with the key. That is an aside, a purple passage. However, it shows that what would not have happened in the past &ndash; joint operations by the security authorities of the United States and Ireland &ndash; have now taken place. What is the Minister's intention in respect of Customs and Excise? Will there be joint operations in Dublin, for example, between Dutch and Irish Customs and Excise officials in pursuit of certain organised drug gangs? Does hot pursuit simply mean crossing a land border or would it permit somebody to come from Roscoff to Rosslare in hot pursuit of somebody coming into Ireland with a supply of drugs?</P>
    <P>Greater clarification is required. While all Members agree in theory with the legislation, there are practical implications. Persons who have holidayed or lived abroad are aware that the practices, procedures and cultures of security and <Col N="566" /> quasi-security forces differ substantially from country to country. What would be acceptable in one culture would be most unacceptable in another. Due to our history and the way we organise our affairs, people in Ireland would not take kindly to the type of rigorous policing one encounters in certain parts of the Continent. Are we just signing up to a series of measures which will not come into effect or are we signing up to a series of measures in respect of hot pursuit, cross border surveillance, controlled delivery of goods, covert investigations and joint special investigation teams which will happen on the ground in this country in the foreseeable future?</P>
    <P>The convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes is welcomed by Fine Gael. There are considerations to be taken into account with regard to what is included in the database, how this can be corrected, whether personal rights are being transgressed and what access persons would have to the database if they felt their rights were being transgressed. If I understand the Minister correctly, the protection will be at least as strong as the protection provided under domestic law and the data protection Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the individual about whom data is stored on the Customs and Excise computerised international system will have the right to have the data checked, corrected or deleted and subsequently to have their rights vindicated in court. I see no provision to oblige Customs and Excise officials to correct the data themselves if, in the course of an investigation, they discover that some of the data entered is erroneous. There does not appear to be such an obligation.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that anybody will go to Customs and Excise and ask if there is data about them stored in their computer, but there should be an obligation on the officials, in circumstances where data is included, to correct it subsequently if an error has been made. One can envisage a situation where somebody is bringing a caravan home after a couple of weeks holiday in Europe. For one reason or other a message might be put through to Irish Customs and Excise that it is suspected the caravan might be involved in carrying drugs. The suspicion might be reasonable at the point of transmission and duly goes into the Customs and Excise computer. The caravan and its occupants are stopped coming through the port, searched and nothing is found. It was a reasonable suspicion by, for example, the French police which was in error. It is unlikely the occupants could access the database so there should be a provision which obliges the Customs and Excise officials to correct information which was put in their database in error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the elaborate framework for the management and supervision of the CIS. It ranges from the committee con<Col N="567" /> sisting of customs administrations in member states to a national supervisory authority and a joint supervisory authority. Those safeguards appear to be admirable and adequate to provide the overall protection that is necessary. Often, however, it is not at the macro level that individuals' rights are transgressed. It is usually at the local or micro level where a piece of damaging information is put into a database and remains there indefinitely. In a small country like ours, if it is on the computer it will be on the street before long. It will be rumoured in pubs that such and such a person was bringing drugs in from the Continent and, although nothing was found on him, he was guilty because the information was received from France. There is a genuine risk here.</P>
    <P>Whenever we sharpen the instruments of attack against organised crime we should be aware that we do so at a cost to the personal freedom of the individual. We must continue to try to strike an appropriate balance. I hope the Minister will take my comments into account and, if the balance is not already there, see if a better balance can be provided.</P>
    <P>The two protocols appear to be uncontroversial. We welcome the fact that the European Court of Justice will be the arbiter and interpreter of the convention. That is appropriate. The second protocol corrects an error where the registration number of a vehicle in which smuggled goods were being transported could not be included in the database. That is an obvious correction. The second deficiency being remedied by the second protocol relates to money laundering. Again, that is uncontroversial. It is appropriate that it be done.</P>
    <P>The convention on mutual assistance and co-operation between customs administrations is wider than the other convention. Whereas the exchange of information convention deals, in effect, with the inclusion of information which Customs and Excise officials consider relevant to prevent the smuggling of goods which would be used in crime, such as drugs and ammunition, this convention appears to deal with the ordinary work of Customs and Excise officials. In cases of the normal carriage of trade goods, infringements or attempts to commit infringements on their import or export would be caught within this convention.</P>
    <P>If I understand it correctly, it does not relate to drugs, guns or ammunition but to normal trade and whether persons engaged in trade and the carriage of goods are guilty or not guilty of infringements. It is important that there is co-operation in this area but it is also important, in the context of normal trade, that the protection of data concerning individuals would be stronger than the requirements to protect data concerning persons who might be involved in smuggling drugs or armaments. I am not clear about the scope of this convention and I ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> The explanatory memorandum states, &ldquo;The requested authority can be asked to carry out surveillance on suspect persons and on means of transport, goods and places. A representative of the applicant authority may be present when action is carried out by the requested authority, provided both authorities agree.&rdquo; If one is importing Third World goods into Ireland, which would be subject to EU tariffs, and if they are transferring those by truck to the United Kingdom in a manner which would transgress the regulations concerning the particular tariffs, does this allow for joint operations in Ireland where UK Customs officials and Irish Customs officials would be involved in surveillance and where members of the other country's service would be personally involved in any operation against them? That is how the memorandum seems to read and I would like if this could be clarified.</P>
    <P>I am not clear what the Minister of State said in respect of this convention and the opt out clauses. When he referred to the opt out clause under this convention, was he referring to the opt out clauses provided under Article 28 where a request for assistance may be refused if it is considered to be prejudicial to public policy or other essential interests and rights of member states, or where the action requested is considered to be disproportionate to the gravity of the offence? Is he confining the Irish opt out simply to the provisions of Article 28 or is he exercising the right to a wider opt out, which I understand is available to member states as a result of the negotiations which took place on the convention?</P>
    <P>The Bill consists of just ten sections. By weight it is a heavy Bill but the heaviness and bulk of it results from the schedules and the copies of the conventions. I do not believe there will be a problem processing the ten sections on Committee Stage. The Bill raises interesting issues about which this House has an obligation to ask questions.</P>
    <P>I compliment the parliamentary counsel's office and the departmental officials for a full and very well laid out explanatory memorandum. In complicated Bills such as this, many Members rely on the explanatory memorandum. As this is a particularly good one, I compliment all those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I had Deputy Noonan's capacity to read the explanatory memorandum and then speak for half an hour on the basis of it. I will not attempt to imitate that in my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill ratifies two conventions, the 1995 EU convention on information technology and the use of information technology for certain purposes and the mutual assistance convention two years later. In a sense, there is not a great deal Members of this House can say or do about it because negotiations have taken place and the agreement has been made intergovernmentally. It is for us to decide whether we wish to subscribe to the conventions at this stage and whether we <Col N="569" /> wish to authorise Government to sign the conventions.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I have no difficulty with the thrust of the conventions. As Deputy Noonan said, the workings of the conventions and how they will be used will be very interesting and raise important issues. There is always a balance to be struck in these matters between the human, civil and legal rights of individuals and the need to give the greatest possible capacity to national and international services to deal with issues of international crime and international smuggling. I travelled recently by plane from Brussels to Munich and I was very struck when I arrived in Munich that I went straight from the arrivals lounge to the taxi rank and there were no Customs and Excise or passport controls. This is a feature of the Schengen Convention to which Ireland is not yet a signatory. It brought home to me the reality of the Single Market where one can now travel from one Schengen country to another without the need for identity cards or customs checks. While this is a great convenience for people travelling as tourists and those engaged in legitimate trade, it is a great opportunity for those engaged in illegal trade and smuggling.</P>
    <P>This raises two major points, first, the need to co-ordinate within the EU by giving the facilities to the national services to co-operate and exchange information and, if necessary, to mount joint investigations and joint operations and, second, the need to ensure that the EU borders are secure and that the individual national services employ the same rules and regulations in manning these borders. The notion of a fortress Europe is somewhat distasteful but the reality is that if we are to break down internal borders within the EU, we have no choice but to put in place clearly understood regulations which are underpinned by joint co-operation along the borders of the EU with eastern Europe and beyond.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Ireland has recently become a place to where goods, particularly drugs, are smuggled as a base not just for the Irish market but for further export within the EU. A couple of days ago I saw information provided to us by the Revenue detailing drugs seizures in this country on foot of questions raised by Deputy Noonan on the Estimates debate. It is quite clear from the volume of the seizures that the drugs were not intended to service just the demand for drugs in this country. It is clear some of it was intended for further export. This brings into clear focus the need for international co-operation.</P>
    <P>On the convention dealing with information technology, I have no problem with the principle of the Bill. However, I would like the opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out how this will work in practice. I had a quick read through the convention and Article 2 states in fairly bald terms what the information can be used for. It reads, &ldquo;The aim of the Customs Information System . shall be to assist in preventing, investigating and prosecuting serious contraventions of <Col N="570" /> national laws by increasing, through the rapid dissemination of information, the effectiveness of the co-operation and control procedures of the customs administrations of the Member States.&rdquo;  On the face of it, no one could have a problem with that. It is also very broad and allows the Revenue Commissioners in our case quite considerable latitude in defining how and for what purpose they will effectively trade information or put information on the system. Article 3 of the convention goes on to set out the information that can be provided through the system. Clauses 5 and 6 are fairly broad in talking about fraud trends as to the sort of information that can be made available.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with relevant national authorities trading information. This is a good thing. Nevertheless, I believe we are taking the whole business of information being provided by individuals a little bit further if we are putting what could be potentially a substantial amount of information on an international system, as I believe there is no conviction involved in most cases and the individuals concerned are merely suspects who have been engaged in suspicious activities or whatever. I would like to know how this will work in practice and how broad will the net be cast. Will the details of tens of thousands of citizens appear on the system and be available to the Dutch and German police and so on or are we talking about people who are likely to have been engaged in serious crime here or abroad? How broad is it intended the information should be?</P>
    <P>What struck me when looking at the details of the drugs seizures &ndash; this is probably a matter of national policy &ndash; was the relatively small amount of heroin seized during the course of 2000. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated in this House that he believes, as I do, that Garda and Revenue activity should focus on heroin because it is destroying communities in Dublin and elsewhere, as Deputy Noonan said. Heroin is the addictive substance behind a great deal of crime in Dublin. The bulk of drug seizures this year in terms of value and volume involved cannabis resin and herbal cannabis. Cannabis should not be decriminalised because there are attendant dangers involved and it should not be the primary focus of the drugs activities of the Garda or the Revenue. They should focus on the heroin problem.</P>
    <P>Virtually all the seizures took place at airports. What does that tell us about the nature of smuggling into Ireland and our capacity to intercept drugs and other smuggled goods at ports or at sea? The White Paper on Defence stated there was no case for broadening the role of the Naval Service or expanding it. The Naval Service comprises eight ships which spend most of their time on fishery protection duty and have little time to do anything else. Does the Revenue envisage a role for the Naval Service in terms of interception of smuggled goods?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> I recall during the prelude to the White Paper there was a debate between the Departments of Finance and Defence regarding what should be the role of the Naval Service. The Department of Finance was to the fore in arguing for a coastguard service and a service which could undertake activities such as interception of smuggled goods. That would be relevant to the operation of this legislation. Does the Minister of State have any comments on this?</P>
    <P>The Customs Co-operation Convention has a much broader remit than exchanging information and it provides for special activities such as hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance, controlled delivery, covert investigations and joint special investigation teams. Ireland has decided to opt out of the hot pursuit and cross-border surveillance provisions. The Minister of State said if the considerations which have led the Government to come to that conclusion change, it would like to be able to reverse that position without coming into the House. He did not outline the considerations and why the Government has decided to opt out of those special activities and forms of co-operation. I am interested to hear his comments on that.</P>
    <P>In the recent past there has been debate in a somewhat different context about hot pursuit across the Irish Border. There is no doubt there is political sensitivity attending thereto. None of us want a scenario where British troops cross the Border in pursuit of smugglers or where regulations that ostensibly dealt with smuggling were abused for other purposes. The context under this legislation is different and in circumstances where the Border has been used for smuggling cattle over the years, for example, a case can be made for the joint surveillance and hot pursuit activities contemplated under the convention. Why has the Minister of State decided not to opt into the convention? What will the considerations be in future in deciding to reverse that position?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State comment on the interaction and co-operation between the CAB, the Revenue Commissioners, the CNDT and the Garda? He mentioned this was covered by a written agreement. There have been instances &ndash; I cannot recall one in recent years &ndash; in the past where one body was trying, at least in terms of public perception, to be more to the fore in dealing with, for example, drug smuggling. I would like the Minister of State to spell out more clearly as the legislation passes through the House how the co-operation between the Garda, the CAB, the CNDT and so on works in practice.</P>
    <P>Almost 700 people work in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The traditional notion of Customs and Excise officers was guys on the Border trying to intercept unfortunate shoppers returning from Belfast with 200 or 300 extra cigarettes in their car boots. We have moved on a long way since then and we are now dealing with serious international crime but I am not clear what the individuals employed by the Revenue <Col N="572" /> Commissioners as Customs and Excise officers do, and how they are deployed. Few are deployed along the Border anymore. How does Customs and Excise operate as a unit within Revenue?</P>
    <P>Joint co-operation with other international bodies is interesting. I do not have a difficulty in principle with the notion, as Deputy Noonan said, of Dutch customs officials being involved in a joint operation in Ireland but their powers should be clear. I recall a senior garda telling me once that he was quite envious of some of the powers of customs officers. Their powers to stop and search are broad and are arguably much broader than those of a garda. If Ireland is to engage in joint operations, it must be clear what are the powers of the officers with whom Ireland is co-operating. For example, would a Dutch officer have the same powers to stop, search and question as a customs officer from this jurisdiction? I hope the Minister of State will tease out that issue.</P>
    <P>The Data Protection Officer will become the national supervisory authority to safeguard individuals' rights under the conventions. How effective is the role of the officer currently? Bodies have information about me and many other citizens and most of us would not dream of contacting the Data Protection Officer. How do those safeguards operate? How many people investigate the information maintained about them and seek to have it corrected, for example, on an annual basis? I do not know whether the system already in place is terribly effective, but, if it is not, broadening its scope into this area is also not likely to be effective.</P>
    <P>If details which identify an individual as a quasi-criminal, suspect, or somebody who is thought likely to engage in illegal activities, are loaded into an information system, what are the implications in terms of libel, for example? Is it possible for an individual to take a case in which he or she can claim he or she has effectively been identified as a potential criminal because his or her details were on the information system? Do such issues arise?</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked whether trafficking in people, which unfortunately is an experience we have had recently, is covered by the conventions and the legislation. Another interesting issue is whether Revenue offences are covered. Will the exchange of information that will be possible when Ireland subscribes to the convention include tax offences, for example? If it comes to light through a CAB investigation, for instance, that somebody may have been guilty of tax evasion will such information be made available to the national authorities in other countries? There is considerable scope for acquiring information which might not otherwise have been possible.</P>
    <P>The protocol deals with the jurisdiction of the European court. However, I am not clear about whether the accepted jurisprudence of the European court as it is built up has force of law in Ireland or if the Irish courts will continue to have power in the first instance to interpret the con<Col N="573" /> vention. Once the European court has decided what it means, is that binding on the Irish courts or can they decide for themselves? I support the thrust of the Bill but I would like to hear more, either in the Minister's reply or a later stage, about the operation of individual sections.</P>

      <P>All Members of the House will agree that Ireland's election to non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council for the 2001-2002 term is a major achievement and a recognition of the esteem in which Ireland is held internationally. The international community has bestowed a tremendous honour on Ireland and we deeply appreciate it. I thank all of the states who voted for us and gave us every support and encouragement during the campaign. I also appreciate everyone in Ireland who supported our campaign.</P>
      <P>Membership of the Council will place Ireland at the centre of decision-making by the body with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Since joining the UN in 1955, our vocation has been to play a distinctive role in areas such as peacekeeping, nuclear disarmament, human rights and development co-operation. The values which have inspired our foreign policy for many years, under successive Governments, will guide our actions on the Council.</P>
      <P>We are also conscious of the trust placed in us by the membership of the United Nations as demonstrated by our election on the first round against stiff opposition. We will seek to remain responsive to the concerns of the wider membership during our time on the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peacekeeping is at the heart of Ireland's contribution to the United Nations. For more than 40 years we have participated continuously in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and Irish personnel have served under UN command in the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe. This experience will enable us to speak with authority when peacekeeping issues come before the Council. The principles of reconciliation, mutual respect and partnership which <Col N="574" /> have informed our approach to the peace process in Northern Ireland will guide our consideration of issues before the Council. African issues are a significant part of the current Security Council agenda. Ireland, through her long-standing support for political and economic development in Africa, will bring an informed view to the Council.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are in discussions with the Department of Finance about the financial resources necessary to fulfil our obligations as a member of the Security Council. They have also identified the extra staffing requirements which will be required to deal with the demands of membership of the Security Council at our Permanent Mission to the UN in New York, in Geneva and at headquarters, and are currently finalising details in discussions with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Security Council is a huge responsibility for Ireland. The Government is determined that we will discharge our responsibilities on the Council in a manner of which the entire country can be proud.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State, and especially the diplomatic staff who in recent years have conducted a sustained campaign to win this post. I am delighted to acknowledge that in the House. Will the Minister be more specific about the question I raised regarding extra staff and resources? I hope these will be made available and will be adequate to cover the needs. Will the Minister indicate the package for which he has sought approval from the Department of Finance, both in terms of personnel and cost?</P>
      <P>I will press him further on the broad policy role we will adopt on the Security Council. To what extent will we be independent in our approach? To what extent will we be affected by views arising from our membership of the European Union? To what extent may other members of the Security Council lean on us in a situation where, for instance, they are providing assistance to us in Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be specific with the Deputy on the basis that we are still involved in the Estimates campaign. Obviously, I had parked this issue until such time as we could see whether we would be successful in our bid for membership of the UN Security Council. The sort of requirements that are being talked about are simply a matter of discussion and approval with the Department of Finance. It will involve extra personnel, both diplomatic and general staff, in New York, Geneva and at headquarters. This issue will be of priority and the political divisions in headquarters staff will be enhanced, particularly in those areas where one can see there will be a workload concerning the desks for the western Balkans, the Middle East and Africa. Clearly, additional personnel will be required in New York to supplement the work of the existing staff <Col N="575" /> complement at our UN mission there. These are logistical issues.</P>
      <P>The permanent representative to the UN will be home next week for discussions with me and departmental officials. Discussions have been going at the appropriate level within the Department as to what the requirements will be and how they can be accomplished. I am confident the requisite support, as assessed by the Department, will be forthcoming, but I must respect the fact that our Estimates on this issue have not been concluded with the Department of Finance. Therefore, I do not want to pre-empt the discussions or assume an agreement until formal approval is given. I have no reason but to believe that we will have the full co-operation of everybody in the Government, on the basis that we want to have an effective and efficient complement of staff who will do a job of which the House can be proud.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's other question, the Government shares a common EU position on a range of foreign policy areas. It is important to note that when we become members of the Security Council we will act on the basis of our own assessment, but we will clearly take into account the views of the wider membership and the other members of the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The suffering of the people of Iraq, especially children, and the problems in implementing the United Nations humanitarian programmes in Iraq, continue to be of deep concern to the Government. We have consistently raised within the United Nations and the EU the urgent need to improve the conditions of the general population in Iraq. The Security Council clearly needs to take full account of the grave humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people in its further consideration of the sanctions issue. Our policy has been to advocate further reductions in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I raised these issues with the US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, in Washington in March, and urged the United <Col N="576" /> States, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to seek to reduce the delays on needed medicines and spare parts for infrastructure. The Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright, listened carefully to the concerns we expressed about the effects of the sanctions on the people of Iraq, especially children. She pointed out the lack of co-operation by the Iraqi authorities with the positive humanitarian provisions in UN Resolution 1284 which was adopted by the Security Council last December, but rejected by Iraq. Our concerns have also been presented in discussions at official level with our British counterparts. Under the provisions of Resolution 1284 the ceiling on the export of oil to fund the purchase of humanitarian supplies was unconditionally removed.</P>
    <P>The Council has introduced an accelerated procedure for the approval of humanitarian supplies which has been in operation since the beginning of March. Under this streamlined procedure, some $2 billion worth of contracts for the food, education, medical, agricultural, water and sanitation sectors have been approved on a basis of notification of the Council. On 24 March, the Council agreed to make a greater allocation for spare parts for the ailing Iraqi oil industry, doubling this budget to $1.2 billion. Nevertheless, the UN Secretary General in his report to the Council of 8 September expressed concern about the negative impact on the rehabilitation of Iraqi infrastructure of holds and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has also addressed these humanitarian concerns directly. A £100,000 grant by Ireland Aid to the International Committee of the Red Cross was agreed last week to address the rehabilitation of health facilities in Iraq as well as water and sanitation facilities.</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 1284 also provides for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with a new disarmament supervisory commission and full compliance with all conditions imposed by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The basis for the continued imposition of sanctions on Iraq remains the Iraqi Government's refusal to co-operate with the UN Special Commission appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The Government regrets that Iraq has not so far fully complied with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, including those provisions concerning Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. With the necessary co-operation from Baghdad, greater progress can be made in the suspension and ultimate lifting of sanctions.</P>
    <P>We hope that further progress will be made on this issue by the time we take our seat on the Security Council in January. As a member of the council, we will consider the position in Iraq in the light of developments and in line with the policy I have outlined above.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree in principle that the punishment of children and civilians is in breach of the Geneva Convention? Does he accept the principle that there can be 1.5 million deaths in ten years, including the deaths of 500,000 children in the name of punishing them because of who is the leader of the country?

      <P>My position is that, under the UN charter, we are obliged to obey the resolutions of the Security Council. However, and I have made this point clear on previous occasions, we have always stated that the imposition of any sanctions regime must be such as to affect the regime and not the people in a way that has caused humanitarian problems of the level to which the Deputy referred. There is some indication of progress in this matter, especially given what the Secretary General of the UN has had to say on these issues, and we hope progress can be made before the end of the year. I hope that, once we become members of the Security Council, we will see in what way we can address the question of sanctions as they affect innocent people who suffer at the hands of the regime as opposed to how they affect the regime directly. The point must also be made that it is open to the Iraqi regime to comply with the resolution to avoid the humanitarian hardships to which its own people are being subjected.</P>

Will he return to the basic question I asked? A sanctions regime which affects infrastructure, health and the civilian population, especially children, is inconsistent with the guarantees given to such people in the Geneva Convention.</P>

      <P>As I have stated, it has been, and continues to be, the view of the Government that we monitor the effect of the sanctions regime in such a way as to avoid delays of the humanitarian <Col N="578" /> assistance provided for by the lifting of the ceiling pending full implementation of Resolution 1284. It has been brought to our attention that there have been delays and we have made representations consistently at UN level to seek to ensure that the sanctions committee avoids a situation where these delays continue, even though, unfortunately, we do not have compliance with Resolution 1284.</P>
      <P>It was asked what discussions we have had and what position we envisage taking on this issue when we take up our membership of the Security Council. The Secretary General has raised this as an issue generally, not just concerning Iraq but others subjected to a sanctions regime. There is a need for the UN collectively to assess objectively the advantages and disadvantages of a sanctions regime and how a range of activities under the sanctions policy which will affect the regime rather than innocent people in those countries will be provided for, which is the reason sanctions are imposed.</P>

      <P>The Government's position on EU enlargement is clear and has not changed since the last time I answered questions on this topic in the House. Ireland is a strong supporter of the current enlargement process for strategic reasons of peace and for economic reasons. We look forward to welcoming the new member states when they have satisfactorily completed their negotiations and have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership. Enlargement will provide important economic opportunities for new and existing member states alike. Enlargement will also give us the opportunity to address outstanding problems on our continent, including such vital issues as organised crime and a better functioning relationship with Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union. In addition, an enlarged European Union can play a more important and more credible role in world affairs.</P>
      <P>Enlargement negotiations are now at a substantive phase. The forthcoming Commission assessment reports on enlargement, due in early November, should be helpful in making the necessary decisions to give a renewed impetus to the process. The European Council in Nice in December will have to weigh up the achievements of the process to date and chart the course for the coming years with a view to stimulating further progress and giving a very clear positive signal to the applicant countries that their efforts will be rewarded in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> Ireland has benefited enormously from EU membership. We have, at the same time, contributed constructively to the Union's development, politically and institutionally. The decade ahead will bring its own momentous happenings, not least of which will be enlargement. These developments will influence the necessary integration process leading to the further construction of the Union. Ireland views this prospect positively. We are in favour of integration. It does not mean centralisation or federalisation, rather the further development and improvement of the manner in which Europeans freely co-operate and work together while respecting diversity.</P>

Does he accept there are many concerns on the part of those of us who appreciate our membership of the European Union arising from the comments of his colleague, the Minister, Deputy de Valera, who specifically stated that she was not in favour of closer integration in Europe? Does he further accept that there is concern on our part arising from the vote by his Fianna Fáil colleagues in the European Parliament against enlargement?</P>
      <P>Does he also accept that the ethos of his party will be questioned arising from the document circulated yesterday, A Programme for Civic Education for Second Level Schools, which mentioned that the European Union consists of 12 member states?

      <P>Regarding the MEPs, it has been the policy of successive Governments, including those of which the Deputy was a member or which he supported, that we are opposed to co-decision between the Parliament and the Council regarding Common Agricultural Policy decisions.

What they voted against was the co-decision powers which the Brok report intimated should exist concerning the Common Agricultural Policy. Successive Governments, including that of which Deputy John Bruton was leader three years ago, have taken the view that this is not Irish Government policy.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the opportunity to review the report to which the Deputy refers, however I am aware of the media reports which surrounded this report's publication last week. Child poverty is an issue of particularly grave concern, not only in eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, but throughout the world. The central foundation for the Government's programme of development co-operation, administered by my Department, is that of poverty alleviation and the most vulnerable section of any population subjected to pov<Col N="581" /> erty are its children. Ireland's programme has traditionally been focused upon the least developed countries where the need is most acute and Ireland's contribution can best be focused.</P>
      <P>Ireland's assistance to the newly independent countries of eastern Europe is mainly channelled through the EU PHARE and TACIS programmes. The focus on poverty reduction is also central to the European Union development model. In addition, my Department administers a modest eastern Europe budget which supports a trust fund at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a small number of bilateral projects in the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, a significant proportion of the funds provided for technical assistance under the Irish World Bank consultancy trust fund has also been focused on the countries of the region. A major thrust for our assistance to this region has been to encourage and foster economic development and through this process better enable the economies of these countries to provide to a greater extent for their citizens' needs.</P>
      <P>Support for the children of this region is also underlined by a number of contributions provided in recent years under my Department's NGO co-financing scheme. These funds have been provided to several orphanages, schools and kindergartens amounting to more than £195,000 since the beginning of 1999 throughout eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. This assistance has gone towards improving the conditions experienced by the children concerned.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also consistently contributed to emergency and rehabilitation situations that arise throughout this region as elsewhere. Most recently, almost £400,000 has been provided as assistance for Chechen internally displaced persons in Ingushetia and for relief assistance for the people of Tajikistan as a result of severe drought conditions.</P>
      <P>As well as assistance to the region on a bilateral and EU basis, Ireland is a significant contributor to UNICEF, one of the most highly regarded UN development agencies. UNICEF is actively engaged in the areas of health and education of children and women throughout the entire world and has been a key recipient of Irish support for many years.</P>
      <P>While the major thrust of Irish official development assistance will continue to be focused upon the least developed countries, we will not lose any opportunity to advocate measures which support the needs of children throughout the world, including eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the accuracy of this report and the fact that up to 50 million children in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are living in poverty and in conditions worse than those in the Third World? If so, what is he doing about it? If the report is accurate, it is a horrifying statistic which should <Col N="582" /> be a wake up call and spur major action on the part of western Europe. Will the Minister take this issue seriously as an area in which we can make a contribution?</P>
      <P>Do the ODA rules cover contributions from the ODA budget to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union? This may be an issue in the context of the extra ODA funds which will come on stream. If not, we will have to find another route. There is a significant obligation on us to at least think of the children on our doorstep while protecting our other duties throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a specific subhead under our development programme for assistance to eastern European countries and those of the former Soviet Union. Some of these countries are not capable of being backed and others are not regarded as the worst cases under the development programmes.</P>
      <P>The review of the development programme which will take place on foot of the Government's decision to reach the UN target of 0.7% by 2007, and which will involve a quadrupling in volume terms of our development aid programme, will consider the whole question of to what extent we can further assist countries in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. These issues will be considered by the committee and recommendations will be considered in that context.</P>
      <P>In terms of the EU Commissioner Mr. Patten's work and the question of assistance for the Balkans which is becoming a priority area of activity at EU level, it is clear that our bilateral programmes and what we contribute at EU level will filter through to the priority needs as identified by the relevant agencies.</P>

These countries have had to adjust to the market economy system the consequences of which are that the weakest, the poorest and the most vulnerable, particularly children, are, in many instances, malnourished. Will the Government give a firm commitment to tackle this issue to be best extent possible from the point of view of our own resources and through the EU?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union has evolved, and continues to evolve, with the broadening of its borders through successive enlargements and the deepening of political and economic co-operation among partners. The changes in Europe over the last decade following the fall of the Berlin Wall will be matched by the challenge of <Col N="583" /> integrating into the Union the newly acceding countries of eastern Europe. This in turn will be a major factor in determining the pace and direction of the integration process as the task of maintaining and consolidating the Union continues into the future.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously Ireland views this prospect positively. We are in favour of integration in the sense of further developing and deepening the manner in which we Europeans freely co-operate and work together, while respecting our diversity. We have consistently emphasised in European discussions that the strength of the Union is a function of the unique balances which underpin it, in particular those between the institutions, and between the institutions and the member states. This framework has served as a valuable protection of the interests of smaller member states. We will wish to ensure as the Union develops that these distinctive and essential features remain in place.</P>
      <P>It is recognised, including by the institutions themselves, that there is a continuing need to review existing arrangements and, in particular, to ensure within the Union that issues are dealt with at the most appropriate level. In certain areas, in relation to the Single Market, for example, this requires that decisions be taken at Community level. In others, or in relation to the implementation of decisions taken in a Community framework, the responsibility will more appropriately rest at national or regional level. As the House will be aware, we have consistently argued that taxation, for example, must remain a matter for decision at national level, bearing in mind its importance in the overall management of the economy.</P>
      <P>While taking full account of the functional effectiveness of the Union and its institutions, the level of integration appropriate to the Union must also take into account the requirements of democratic legitimacy. The Union remains a combination of the supra-national and the inter-governmental. It is for this reason we believe the Commission's composition must reflect the involvement of all member states. We believe this makes for a stronger Commission, and one which will best be in a position to play the key role allocated to it under the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Ireland has gained very significantly from membership of the European Union and has at the same time made a positive contribution to the Union's development. We have consistently favoured broadening the Union through enlargement, and, through our participation in EMU, for example, have shown ourselves ready to embrace deepening of the Union. The key achievements of the Union &ndash; the Single Market, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Economic and Monetary Union &ndash; reflect the willingness of European leaders to act on a vision of a shared future. We intend to continue to play our full part in that future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with Deputy Durkan. There is a clear understanding among our colleagues in the Union that we are <i>communautaire</i>. We are very committed to the question of European integration. The integration of the European economy has been a primary factor in the sustained economic growth we have enjoyed. The ability of the Union, for example, to complete the Single Market, to bring competitive pressures to bear in many areas of the economy, has brought greater efficiency, greater competitiveness and greater opportunity for job creation and has certainly developed an enterprise culture here, both in the public and private sectors, and that is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>We have consistently stated that we are in favour both of a widening and deepening of the Union but we need to make sure in conducting this debate that we recognise the institutional balances in the Union have played a major role in its success. The composition of the Union and how it operates is <i>sui generis</i> compared to any other regional organisation in the world. We must be mindful, when we are discussing the changing of those balances &ndash; and the intergovernmental conference to be completed in Nice is part of that reassessment, reappraisal and evolution which takes place continually as we prepare for enlargement &ndash; that we do so in a way which promotes the coherence of the Union and which does not lead to more fragmentary trends.</P>

      <P>I have been made aware by the Attorney General of his presentation of the second national report submitted under Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the UN Committee on Human Rights in Geneva on 13-14 July 2000. The conclusions of the committee, which were received on 26 July, have been circulated widely and are available in the Library and on the Department of Foreign Affairs website.</P>
      <P>In his presentation of the report, which was submitted to the committee on 29 September 1998, the Attorney General gave an update on the very significant developments since then in the area of human rights legislation. He drew attention to the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000, the Equal Status Act, 1998, the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the National Disability Authority Act, 1999. The Attorney General also drew attention to pending legislation in the following areas: disabilities, where a Bill covering access to public bodies, services and participation in the administration of justice will be enacted; rights of children, including an ombudsman for children; incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law; mental health; the establishment of an independent prisons authority; and the reform of the law relating to defamation.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General also gave the committee a brief description of the commitments entered into under the Good Friday Agreement, with particular emphasis on its human rights provisions. He drew attention to the Government's undertaking to &ldquo;bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;these proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments&rdquo;. Progress on implementation of these measures was also reported to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee, in its concluding observations communicated to us on 26 July, recorded its appreciation of the high quality of the report of Ireland, which it deemed to be comprehensive and responsive to the concluding observations made by the committee after the examination of the initial report. The committee also appreciated <Col N="587" /> the additional oral and written information provided by the State party delegation during the examination of the report; this information was seen as highly instructive and enhancing the dialogue between the committee and the delegation. Furthermore the committee welcomed the publication and wide dissemination of the report by the Government and its willingness to involve non-governmental organisations in the process.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General at the conclusion of the examination informed the committee that progress was being made in many areas of concern to it, such as the Garda Complaints Board, the Special Criminal Court, the Offences Against the State Act and prison conditions, and that particular issues which had been raised had been dealt with. The Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights, whose establishment the committee had welcomed in its concluding observations, will meet in the very near future to consider all of the concerns and recommendations of the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General, accompanied by officials from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs, made this long statement but every member of the committee asked him some direct questions. Among those questions was, for example, this direct one: would the guarantees involved in the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights be implemented by the Human Rights Commission? Would the Minister agree that when he was confronted by the fact that we did not have an independent Garda complaints body, his comment was that those parts of the convention we were not implementing presented us with &ldquo;challenging standards&rdquo;? In the end, as I understand it, as reported, the chairperson gave him what was described in one newspaper as a dressing down for not meeting the standards of the convention.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave me a long summary of what the Attorney General stated.

      <P>I do not have information available to me stating that is what the chairperson said to the Attorney General. I am sure the record of the meeting can be circulated to the House for the purposes of accuracy. I made the point in my reply that there was an acknowledgement by the committee of the high quality of the <Col N="588" /> report of Ireland which it deemed to be comprehensive and responsive while it continues to express some concerns. Those concerns were acknowledged and the interdepartmental committee on human rights will meet to consider all those concerns and the recommendations of the committee. We should be prepared to acknowledge that substantive progress could be reported. Clearly, there are other issues which require continuing&mdash;</P>

Will the Minister give us an update on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was another suggestion &ndash; I am being helpful here &ndash; that the Department of Foreign Affairs has won over the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the European Convention on Human Rights may become part of domestic law. Does the Minister agree that the question put at the session was why the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights was not being transposed into domestic law in the same way as the European Convention? Does he agree that at the tail of it, the Attorney General was accused of being &ldquo;eurocentric&rdquo;? </P>

What I will say is that full and detailed replies will be given to the questions he raises. I am sure the answers he will be given will be deemed just as adequate as those which the committee thought they were when it heard them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 32, 43, 77, 78, 79, 89, and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The informal European Council meeting in Biarritz last weekend took stock of progress at the intergovernmental conference, ahead of the <Col N="590" /> scheduled deadline for concluding negotiations at the European Council in Nice in December.</P>
    <P>All partners committed themselves to a successful conclusion to the Intergovernmental Conference at Nice and reviewed progress across the four main agenda items, namely, the extension of qualified majority voting; the size and composition of the Commission; the re-weighting of Council votes and conditions governing the use of closer co-operation.</P>
    <P>Overall, across a range of issues, the Council was able to note the possibility of useful progress in extending the scope of qualified majority voting. The Taoiseach informed his colleagues that Ireland is prepared to endorse QMV for many of the provisions proposed, including transport, industrial policy, structural funds and certain appointments. He also noted our fundamental opposition to QMV for any aspect of taxation, a position shared by a number of other member states. We take that view because we believe any change in the present arrangements would put at risk the economic model, with its strong emphasis on the partnership approach, which we have followed in this country for many years, and which has contributed to the substantial expansion of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Commission was also discussed in depth, with the Taoiseach reiterating our well known support for one Commissioner per member state. The larger countries continue to argue for a capped Commission.</P>
    <P>The re-weighting of votes is proving to be one of the most difficult areas to resolve. We have taken a pragmatic approach, but are naturally determined that, while demographic factors are taken into account, existing balances are not unduly distorted. Finally, on closer co-operation, our position was that, while prepared to consider easing the flexibility provisions, we wanted to ensure this would be accompanied by appropriate safeguards for the coherence of the Union. This view was widely shared, and there is strong support for facilitating non-participating members in joining at a later date. Ireland also made known its views with regard to flexibility in the second pillar, in particular our wish to avoid undermining the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</P>
    <P>Overall, the discussions at Biarritz helped to clarify the various issues and to prepare the ground for the intensive discussions which will take place between now and the European Council in Nice. We continue to stress the importance of a balanced outcome which meets the interests of member states and equips the Union for the challenging period ahead.</P>
    <P>Finally, the question of whether ratification of a treaty agreed at Nice would require constitutional amendment can be decided only when the treaty is concluded, and in the light of the relevant legal advice. The question of whether changes relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy are envisaged, and would be such as to require a referendum, is referred to in my <Col N="591" /> separate answer to a question from Deputy Gormley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline what extension of qualified majority voting has been agreed to for the Nice treaty? To what new areas will it be applied? In regard to the new treaty and the operation of the Common Foreign and Security policy, will he indicate what has happened to the proposals to merge the Western European Union into the EU and to attach a protocol allowing the neutrals to opt-in or opt-out of the Western European Union's common defence provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined to the Deputy the general areas where we have indicated our willingness to extend QMV. These discussions are continuing and until the full package, if you like, has been agreed, the final positions will not be taken. We are in a negotiating position. No formal decisions were taken at the informal council at Biarritz because it is an informal council. It was simply a stocktaking exercise by the Prime Ministers and Heads of State for the purpose of indicating what momentum should enter the debate as we prepare for Nice through the General Affairs Council, whose job it is to deal with the detailed negotiations. I have outlined in my reply general areas where we are considering the extension of QMV, and it is clear there will be an extension of QMV. The final list, if you like, has not yet been decided nor will it be until we get closer to the Nice summit.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, our position has always been, and remains, that we do not believe any Western European Union commitment is required. We do not agree that a mutual defence commitment of any kind should form part of a Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union. We continue to hold that view. The flexibility issue, how it will apply and what pillars will apply is still a matter for discussion and negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Irish position is that we do not see the inclusion of a Western European Union into a defence commitment forming part of CFSP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the discussion at Biarritz in preparation for the Treaty of Nice, was there discussion on the merits of amending the treaty fundamentally to accept the European Convention on Human Rights as an alternative to the prepared document which has had different names, including a declaration of rights in the European Union and a charter of rights in the European Union? Perhaps the Minister will tell us what his Department thinks of it. Is it a charter with a parallel force of law with the European <Col N="592" /> convention or is it a political declaration? If it is the former, will the Minister be preparing for a referendum to bring it into effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Were this charter to take on a legal character, it would involve the requirement of a referendum to be incorporated into our law. Our view and the consensus view of the Council of Ministers, is that this will emerge as a political declaration at Nice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a political declaration &ndash; if I may finish this point &ndash; can the Minister assure us then that the rights of appeal of a citizen under the European Convention are not affected by this political declaration? What of the parts of the declaration, as I have read in the final draft, as are parallel to the European Convention? Which prevails, in his view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, the jurisdiction of Strasbourg relating to the Convention on Human Rights is the relevant jurisdiction for the Convention on Human Rights. It is not the purpose to set up a parallel jurisdiction under the Court of Justice arrangements within the European Union framework. That is not the purpose for which the charter has been prepared. A formal decision must be taken at Nice relating to the charter and the status it will have. At this stage in the negotiations, it is my view that it will emerge as a political declaration which will not compete with the legal status of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is the case, will it not be perceived as an inhibiting and delaying filter, in the way of the ordinary citizen, seeking to vindicate his or her rights under the convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not believe it will. The purpose for which the charter was devised came from the then German Presidency, to indicate to the wider European citizenry what it believed was provided by the European Union. As the Deputy knows, an argument was made in terms of the long-term development of the European Union, about constitutionalisation, as to whether this will form the basis of some European constitution in the future. That idea, while it can be discussed, is one which must be seen in the context of the steps which will next be taken concerning the European Union &ndash; beyond the enlargement issue, which will take up the next decade anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is not a charter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is what is known as a charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A rose by any other name. Concerning the Commission, is it correct that the principle of one commissioner per member state is conceded at this stage? The other aspect to this <Col N="593" /> matter concerns junior and senior commissioners. I take it the Government has opposed any such approach and that idea is thrown out also at this stage?</P>
      <P>On the question of reweighting of votes, the Minister said that the Government's approach is to be pragmatic on this issue. Is that a code for saying that we are prepared to concede and that we will end up with a lesser number in our weighting as far as this country is concerned? On the question of a referendum, partly because I am interested to know whether we will have one, does the Minister accept that the groundwork should be laid and that if we are to have a referendum, more effort should be made to inform the people of the issues? Otherwise, they will be totally in the dark and we will all rush into a referendum without any proper opportunity to discuss it. Will the Minister say that if the charter is a political declaration, which seems to be what is emerging from discussions, and if what emerges is purely some rebalancing or reweighting, on that basis, if that is the result of Nice, will a referendum be necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the process of a negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the idea of one Commissioner per member state, that has not been conceded. There are two very distinct views currently as to whether it should be a capped Commission or a Commission comprising one Commissioner per member state. There is no concession made by any of the large five countries relating to dropping their second Commissioner, for example, until&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I am informing the Deputy of the facts. The position of the large five countries is that they do not concede the second Commissioner&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;informally they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I will make a third attempt to get through this point. It will make sense to the Deputy when he hears it. They do not concede dropping their second Commissioner until such time, in compliance with the protocol of Amsterdam, that there is a decision on the reweighting issue. That was the basis on which they agreed the protocol. Until and unless there is agreement on the reweighting matter, the commissionership issue will not be resolved. Therefore, when I talk about being pragmatic, I mean that we cannot insist on obtaining one Commissioner per state, with a reduction of the big five down to one each without a reweighting. That is the basis on which the protocol was negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must await the outcome of the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference and take <Col N="594" /> our legal advice as to whether a referendum is required. Once we receive the proper outcome, a good outcome for this country, we will do whatever is required to validate it in our law. However, one cannot predict the outcome at this stage because it depends on a range of issues which are still up for discussion. The Biarritz Summit was simply a stocktaking exercise and there will be much discussion between now and our meeting at Nice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>Is the Minister conscious of the danger arising from the Biarritz Summit and discussions that may take place between now and in Nice, as to the emergence of a two-speed Europe under the guise of one group of countries being more committed than the others to, for instance, the fundamental charter, defence and security, qualified majority voting and all the other points such as reweighting of votes etc. that the Minister mentioned? Does there appear to be a possibility now of the emergence of two deliberate and specific trends?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to have a treaty at Nice, it will depend on whether a consensus can emerge on these issues about which there are still differences. Therefore, I am making it clear that if we do not resolve the reweighting issue, we will not have a treaty at Nice. We need to resolve that issue as far as the larger member states are concerned, or they will not concede on the second Commissioner matter. On the question of reinforced co-operation, as it is called, or flexibility, it has been suggested that this could involve a two-speed Europe, an undefined concept meaning different things to different people depending on where one says it. As the concept of reinforced co-operation or flexibility has been discussed, it has emerged, that people recognise that it must be as a last resort, within the institutional framework, it must remain open to those who do not join it immediately and there must be a role for the Commission as the guarantor of the treaties, to ensure that it does not become a treaty within a treaty operation. There are a number of conditions emerging in the discussions which dictate whether we will get agreement on reinforced co-operation in any of the various pillars. That is the issue which is under discussion at the moment. The discussions over the past seven or eight months have brought greater clarity, in terms of what it means and how it might operate. We now must deal with the pragmatic details of the areas in which it is envisaged that it will operate, so that countries can make decisions on their final positions at Nice.</P>

      <P>I have received a number of representations in relation to the present practitioners of Falun Gong. Some of these represen<Col N="596" /> tations are of a general nature while others relate to specific cases. The Falun Gong was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999. Ireland, together with its EU partners, has closely monitored the measures taken by the Chinese Government against Falun Gong practitioners. We have expressed our concern about the situation and called on the Chinese authorities to respect the human rights of individuals. We have urged the Chinese authorities not to act against the principles in the UN covenants signed by China, in particular those relating to the freedoms of expression, assembly and association. We have also expressed concern about the number of arrests and the heavy sentences imposed on some members of the Falun Gong movement. These concerns also extend to heavy sentences imposed on members of the China Democratic Party and on members of Christian churches. Our concerns have been expressed both bilaterally and through the EU. The Tánaiste, during the course of her visit to China last month, also raised them with the Chinese authorities.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be disrespectful. It is a matter of whether one adopts an attitude of how to advance the promotion of human rights through dialogue or decides not to have dialogue or exert any influence over the internal affairs of a country such as China. One can take the isolationist view and decide one will not get anywhere or one can continue with dialogue to try to reach a common view where people would address human rights within their own political systems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 29, 38 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I raised the situation of Fr. Forde and the peace community at La Union with the Colombian Foreign Minister, Dr. De Soto. My Department was also in contact with EU resident embassies in Bogotá and with the US State Department. Prior to President Clinton's recent visit to Colombia, the Taoiseach sent him a message setting out our concern about La Union. At the Millennium Summit in New York, the Taoiseach met President Pastrana of Colombia and, against the background of hopes for the peace process, expressed our concern that everything possible should be done to ensure the safety of Fr. Forde and the people of La Union. Subsequently, our ambassador, based in Mexico City, visited Bogotá to present credentials on a secondary basis there. President Pastrana confirmed to him that an investigation into the 8 July killings is well under way. The investigating commission was set up following consultation between the Colombian Vice President, who has special responsibility for human rights, and representatives of the peace community, with the participation of the Intercongregational Commission for Justice and Peace. Investigators from the offices of the Attorney General and State Prosecutor visited the area. The Bogotá office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was also involved.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Bogotá, our ambassador was informed that additional security measures requested by the community at La Union are also in hand. These include road repairs, better lighting and radio links. My Department will continue to monitor the situation at La Union as well as the progress of the investigation against the background of the efforts being made to advance the peace process in Colombia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By bearing witness to the atrocity committed at La Union, Fr. Brendan Forde has helped to raise awareness of the terrible violence which has been afflicting that country for a very long time and which has further intensified during the past decade. In my initial statement following the events at La Union, I emphasised the necessity for all <Col N="599" /> concerned to make a commitment to respect human rights and to engage in the peace process initiated by President Pastrana of Colombia.</P>
    <P>Plan Colombia sets out the proposals of President Pastrana's Government to address on an integrated basis the enormous problems facing that country. The preface to the plan states: &ldquo;We need to build a state for social justice which will protect all our citizens and uphold their right to life, dignity and property, freedom of belief, opinion and the press . . . we have to reduce the causes and provocations of violence by opening new paths to social participation&rdquo;. The plan encompasses: (1) the peace process; (2) new approaches to the economy; (3) counter-drugs strategy; (4) reform of the justice system and protection of human rights and (5) democratisation and social development.</P>
    <P>It envisages overall expenditure of $7.5 billion, $4 billion of which is to be provided by the Colombian Government, with 75% of all money to be allocated to socio-economic, human rights and institution building programmes. President Pastrana has appealed for a total of $3.5 billion in assistance from the international community.</P>
    <P>In July 2000, the US Congress approved $1 billion aid over two years in equipment, including 90 army helicopters, and training for the Colombian police and army to enhance their anti-drugs capability particularly crop destruction on industrial drug plantations. More than $300 million was provided for a range of social, economic and institutional reform programmes including voluntary alternative crop development for small farmers; environmental protection; assistance for displaced persons; protection for human rights workers; support for Colombian and international NGOs in documenting incidents and patterns of collusion between paramilitaries and State forces; support for the development of a national human rights strategy and the establishment of a network of human rights task forces; reform of the judicial system and criminal code and training of police and judges.</P>
    <P>While the US programme, therefore, has two dimensions, EU support for the peace process, on the other hand, will be strictly confined to exclusively socio-economic and institutional reform measures. In discussions to prepare the EU position, Ireland has placed particular emphasis on full respect for human rights, meaningful consultation with civil society and the necessity to address the underlying causes of conflict. At the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 9 October, the EU reaffirmed its political support for the peace effort, offering active assistance in the negotiating process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the representations made on behalf of the Minister and the Government in connection with Fr. Forde. Does the Minister agree Fr. Forde is probably one of the greatest Irish nationals in the world at the <Col N="600" /> moment, given the work he is doing in Colombia? Does he agree with Commissioner Neilson, the EU Commissioner for human rights and development, who recently said to the Irish MEPs that the priest is in no danger and that everything in his area is calm, given that over the past week 11 people were summarily executed within five miles of where Fr. Forde works?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Hayes in commending the courage, commitment and dedication of Fr. Forde, who is working in very difficult circumstances. It would be very remiss of anyone to give unqualified or unconditional indications that all will be safe in any part of Colombia, given the huge amount of violence that permeates that society and the unpredictability of the situation. We have, through our diplomats and embassies and through contact with Senator Kennedy's office and others, tried to ensure the President of the United States was aware of the situation before he went and that he would raise it. We are doing our utmost to bring to the attention to the authorities the need to ensure the security of this fine man.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the efforts made to secure Fr. Forde's safety. Is the Minister aware that the development subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has decided to recommend to Government that it opposes Plan Colombia? The Minister described in his reply the initial purchase of helicopters. He could have gone on to describe the defoliation of whole areas and the movement of people. What it is proposed the European Union and Ireland assist, is subsequent to military expenditure. Our part of Plan Colombia is fixing up what is essentially a military endeavour to deal with a civil and political problem. Is the Minister aware the development subcommittee, which includes members from different parties, has said it opposes Plan Colombia and favours an alternative based on the indigenous needs and consultation with the communities on the ground? Why would the Minister not respond to that and oppose Plan Colombia at European Union level and seek to advance an alternative?</P>

Given that most of this military aid is going to state sponsored paramilitary organisations on the ground, the majority of which have murdered many of the communities Fr.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I have been making is that at the international conference in Madrid on 7 July, the European Union Presidency made clear the European Union position, which we support. The European Union believes the Government of Colombia must continue to put in place and reinforce efforts in favour of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is also essential that those paramilitary groups and guerrilla organisations, FARC and ELN, which continue to commit massive human rights abuses, especially kidnapping and extortion, which violate international humanitarian conventions must accept these values and, consequently, cease their criminal activities. The Colombian Government must reinforce those efforts and measures already in place to end the criminal activities of the paramilitaries. It is especially important to the European Union that the Colombian Government brings to an end the impunity enjoyed at present by all those, paramilitaries included, who commit human rights violations. That is the EU position to which we subscribe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 20, 24 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach announced in early September at the UN Millennium Summit in New York that, following a for<Col N="604" /> mal decision by the Government on 6 September 2000, Ireland will move to meet the UN target for aid to developing countries, 0.7% of GNP, by 2007. He announced too that, as evidence of the Government's determination to honour this commitment, the aid programme would reach 0.45% of GNP in 2002.</P>
    <P>Discussions are under way to finalise the allocation for next year, which I am confident, will be appreciably increased on the allocation for this year. Furthermore, it is likely there will be agreement on fixed allocations for the three years 2001, 2002 and 2003, with the allocation for the second year in line with the interim ODA target of 0.45%, estimated at £365 million. This three year deal will have the advantage of allowing for multi-annual budgeting, something especially important in planning expenditure in a growing programme. The net amounts for the Vote will be announced in the context of the publication of the Abridged Book of Estimates for 2001. Deputies will appreciate that, in the context of Government budgeting processes, it is not possible to make formal allocations for more than three years in advance. However, the intention is to continue to make allocations consistent with achieving the 0.7% target by 2007 which, on current estimates, will imply an ODA allocation of around £800 million in that year.</P>
    <P>In addition to addressing the allocations issue and agreeing on paths to the interim and UN targets, the Government also decided that the whole overseas development programme should be reviewed in order to establish an updated aid policy as the foundation for the programme's expansion. Plans to carry out this review are at an advanced stage. The process will determine priorities for development assistance including the range of bodies through whom aid can be channelled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that Ireland will adhere to this commitment regardless of whether our economic growth changes in the meantime? Since the UN recommended target is not necessarily written in stone and it is acceptable to exceed it, given our economic growth to date, would it be possible to exceed that target which is a basic minimum target?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment which has now been articulated in a very important forum, the UN Assembly, by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Irish Government is a repetition of a commitment previously given but on this occasion it is backed up by Cabinet decision and agreement with the Department of Finance that we will move towards the UN target and reach the interim target of 0.45%. High economic growth in recent years has impacted negatively on our ability to reach the ODA percentages we had planned for ourselves. In volume terms the programme and the budget have increased by 61% since this Government came into office. Notwith<Col N="605" /> standing those volume increases insufficient progress was made on the percentage of ODA to GNP. For that reason a decision was made by Government to commit itself to that UN target. It is true that target was set 30 years ago by the UN and only four countries, Norway, Sweden, Holland and Denmark, have reached or exceeded that target. When we reach that target in 2007 we will join a small group of developed countries which have reached the UN target. Some of those countries have exceeded that UN which is much to their credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate what new facts have changed her mind from the time in March when she suggested that the interim target of 0.45% would not be met? We announced this at a crucial moment when seeking support for membership of the Security Council. Would it not have been a better indication of our sincerity if the Government had accepted the private Bill proposed by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, to achieve the UN target within two years, given that our remit on the Security Council is two years? In the gap between 2002 and 2007 will she indicate how she will structure that set of three year and two year gaps? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between now and March when I expressed my concerns as to our ability to reach even the interim target by 2002 is that there has been a Cabinet decision. This means there is full support from all Ministers to transform our ability in terms of our interaction with the wider world by increasing our ODA budget, by current estimates, to £365 million at the end of 2002 which is an increase of about £160 million over two years. No other Government budget is growing at that level. Not only is there cross-party support for it but it has the support of the social partners. That has contributed very significantly to the ability of the Government to make this announcement. This brings me to the Labour Party Bill which suggested, as did Fine Gael, that our commitment to reach the UN target should be framed in statute. It transpires that it has not been necessary to legislate for that commitment because of the Cabinet decision which underpins it. That all parties support this major expansion in our overseas development aid programme lays the foundations for the continuation into future governments of the commitment which the Government has announced, regardless of what party is in Government at the time of the 2007 budget. The three-year multi-annual process which we embarked upon two years ago will enable the Minister for Finance during the Estimates debate to announce not only the budget for 2001 but for 2002 and 2003 towards reaching the UN target. It is important to acknowledge this has been made possible by the cross-party consensus on this issue. In other words, it can transcend political party differences and become a strong endorsement by the Irish people of the <Col N="606" /> need for Ireland to engage in overseas development assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government on this step. For many years we were pressing for a cross-party commitment on this issue. In the past the Fianna Fáil Party was not progressive on the issue. A former leader of Fianna Fáil, Charles J. Haughey, when I asked him if a Minister of State would be appointed to deal with overseas co-operation said such an appointment was supernumerary and superfluous. Given that we have got this far the main point I wish to focus on is the effectiveness of the aid. Will the Minister of State accept that much of the aid around the world is wasted, though not the Irish aid? In connection with the review, will there be an opportunity for Oireachtas committees to discuss it and for an input from this House? Will we have an opportunity to talk about how we might help with regard to possible new priority countries such as Vietnam, the situation in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union? I suggest the widest possible consultation takes place in relation to the review so that we can be satisfied that the best new additional programme will be put in place and these new resources will be put to the best use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference for a review which has been indicated as part of the Government decision as required in order to provide an enduring policy basis to drive the expansion of the programme is being put in place. The terms of reference for the review will include, <i>inter alia</i>, consultation with all stakeholders, including the political parties. Central to the success and sustainability of our expanding aid programme is the continuing support of all parties in the House, the social partners, the churches and civil society. I am anxious that a sense of public ownership be engendered by the review so people will know how this money is spent. It is a major expansion in the budget and not before time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy indicated that in the past some parties were not in favour of this. The proof of this is that this Government has increased the budget by 61% since taking office. To give the House a measure of the growth of the programme, in 1992 the overseas development assistance budget was £40 million and it is now £208 million. This is a great tribute to Irish politics in that everybody is now supportive of the budget being expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Volume, however, is not the only issue. It is an important issue because it is the objective way we are assessed by the DAC of the OECD, which assesses our performance in this area. Quality and achieving a quality programme are also significant. The review will be comprehensive. It will consult with our developing partner countries, NGOs, the wider civil society and with members of the development and human rights sub<Col N="607" /> committee of the Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask about the 0.45% target. I am not aware of any constitutional inhibition on going beyond three years in what is agreed with the Department of Finance. If it has been agreed to move from wherever we are now to 0.45% in 2002, will the Minister assure me there has been an agreement with the Department of Finance to get from 0.45% to 0.7% by 2006? It would be most unusual. If it is the case that such an agreement exists, what is the inhibition to giving an indicative percentage for each of the years to 2006?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly useful for people to be able to plan for future growth in their programmes. We are entering into multi annual budgeting arrangements for block grants with five significant Irish NGOs. As I understand it, when the Estimates are announced and agreed this year, there will be an announcement by the Minister for Finance not only for 2001 but also for 2002 and 2003. We have indicative charts which are being discussed with the Department of Finance. On current GNP estimates, we intend that the upward trajectory will be outlined so that it will reach £800 million by 2007.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's programme of development co-operation recognises the important role which NGOs play in development efforts throughout the developing world. Their contribution to work at the grassroots level and in emergency situations is particularly noteworthy. The bilateral programme has built strong and solid relationships with Irish NGOs and missionary orders over the years. In 1992, £3.4 <Col N="608" /> million was channeled for development through NGOs; this increased to £20.7 million in 1998 and £24.6 million in 1999. These figures are indicative of the belief of the Government in the capacity of NGOs to reach the poor and marginalised and in building the capacity of these groups to determine their own development.</P>
      <P>In a situation of increased funding, as was committed by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government at the Millennium Summit on 6 September, the role of NGOs can and should be strengthened. I am currently considering the introduction of multi annual funding for the larger NGOs which are already in receipt of block grants. This will facilitate better planning of their development activities and provide a greater measure of assurance regarding funding levels. This more strategic approach will also facilitate a greater focus on the quality of outcomes and impact of development projects and programmes. We will work with all NGOs to build an even more robust partnership with them and indeed with the various strands of civil society with an interest in development. The search for sustainable development through quality interventions and the adoption of best practice is a collective endeavour.</P>
      <P>In the context of an expanding aid programme, a review is being undertaken with a view to providing the best possible basis for the planned expansion and development of the enlarged programme. This process will include,<i> inter alia</i>, consultations with the main NGOs and also the smaller ones represented by Dóchas, the representative body for Irish development NGOs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that, in relation to co-operation with NGOs mediated through the European Union, what is happening in Brussels is a disaster? Will she give an indication of what funds have been voted for development and what proportion of them have been disbursed by the European Commission or the DG for development in the Commission? Does she not agree that the time has come for her and her Department to put an end to the disgraceful position in which a vast amount of money voted for the relief of distress has not been allocated because of unexplained bureaucratic delays? The NGOs are correctly concerned about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has deviated a little from the original question but I have some information on the undisbursed funds. A number of factors contributed to the high level of unspent funds. They include Commission bureaucracy, member state micro management and political decisions to freeze funds in certain cases. Ireland, in common with a number of like minded member states, has been pressing the Commission to take action to clear the backlog and increase the effectiveness of EU aid. A major reform, which was discussed at the last meeting of the Development Council, is under way in this regard. The GAC is also taking an interest in the efficiency of <Col N="609" /> the EU development programme and the external assistance mechanisms of the Union.</P>
      <P>The original question related to NGOs. The percentage of money we spend through NGOs has increased considerably to the current level of 14% of ODA. We greatly value their expertise. Many people urge that more money should be channeled through NGOs and we are looking at that in the context of an expanding budget. However, we believe it is important to have a mix of activities which meet the diverse and changing needs of developing countries. Central to that is working with developing country partner governments to build up their capacity to develop and work through multilateral agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that, in relation to the proposals that will be brought forward which give an even greater role to the NGOs, the Minister proposes to address the situation in the development directorate in the European Commission? Will the Minister, for the record, give the figure for undistributed funds? Will she agree that when a disaster happens in any part of the world and there is a response from the EU, the ability of people to gather funds that will impact on the communities involved is damaged by the fact that there is a huge backlog of voted money not transferred to those in need? Perhaps I should table this question again after the next meeting of development Ministers but I hope the Minister will agree that the present situation is simply unsatisfactory. NGOs might have a better role in what she is planning for them in the future in the context of the Irish Government's funding but they are being hampered by what is happening in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is widespread concern about the undisbursed funds.</P>
      <P>We have been pressing at official and ministerial level for a reform package and Commissioners Nielson and Patten have produced reform proposals. The Commission is now seeking changes to the financial regulation which envisaged a sunset clause allowing for the transfer of funds if they have not been spent within a maximum of two years. This would introduce much needed flexibility which would help with efforts to use unspent funds in other areas. We have pressed the Commission to ensure the communication on the accelerated action against HIV and AIDS, for example, and the action plans are backed up by significant resources.</P>
      <P>The credibility of the overall endeavour of overseas development assistance has taken a hammering because of bureaucracy within the European Union. All Ministers agreed that it is important for the Commission to reform this aspect so that Ministers can justify in their parliaments this issue and argue for an increased allocation for overseas development assistance.</P>

Together with the Taoiseach, I met President Kostunica at a luncheon meeting held at the end of the informal European Council in Biarritz last Saturday. He has been assured of the welcome for a democratic Yugoslavia in the European family and he is also aware of our desire to restore normal bilateral relations with his country.</P>
      <P>We are actively considering what assistance we may be able to provide to Serbia in the coming months. We have already provided some humanitarian assistance for Serbian refugees as well as support for the free media in Serbia. Ireland supported the recent decision by the European Union to remove the oil embargo and the flight ban. We will review, together with our EU partners, the remaining measures to ensure their impact is confined to former President Milosovic and his immediate associates. It remains our view that all indicted war criminals in Serbia should be brought for trial at the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting last week-end in Biarritz endorsed an immediate aid package of 200 million euros. Ireland supported this decision. In the period ahead, we will work constructively, with our EU partners and the countries of the region, to ensure the process of democratisation and stabilisation proceeds as quickly and effectively as possible. We will also be supporting the rapid integration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the Stability Pact for South East Europe. We will be able to review the results of these initial efforts to assist Yugoslavia at the forthcoming Summit of the European Union and Balkan States to be held in Zagreb on 24 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Zagreb Summit, together with the implementation of the decisions reached in the framework of the Stability Pact, should pave the way for enhanced co-operation at the regional level. In this regard, we look forward to closer relations between the countries of the region and the Euro<Col N="611" /> pean Union. Ireland will continue to actively support the consolidation of democracy and economic reconstruction of the region through our participation in the international peace-keeping bodies in the former Yugoslavia and the provision of rehabilitation assistance.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Given the present volatile situation in Yugoslavia, is he prepared to use Ireland's considerable influence at UN and EU level to follow up the thrust of what he has indicated to the House in a progressive and positive way to ensure the protection of the institutions of state, which are emerging democratically? I hope that there will be consistent and persistent follow up in the pursuit of those accused of war crimes and that there will be no dispute whatever about the position taken by the rest of the free world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The view is that the first priority is to consolidate the election victory of the democratic forces in Yugoslavia. Only then will the new administration be in a position to act on international warrants. President Kostunica is aware of international public opinion on this issue. My colleagues and I will be monitoring closely developments in this regard but we must be pragmatic and understand the need to prioritise for the moment. There is no question of Mr. Milosevic being let off the hook. As the Deputy said, we will act in all fora in the years ahead, including at Security Council and UN level, as constructively as we can to bring about a regeneration of the economy of the Balkan region. There is a need for the countries in that region to improve bilateral relations with one another and to rebuild from the catastrophe which has befallen them all. There are now democratic forces in all these countries and it is a matter of assisting them through the Stabilisation Pact and the various mechanisms available between themselves bilaterally and as a region to see how we can assist them to rebuild their country and consolidate democracy in the region.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. At first glance it may not appear to be very important or wide-ranging legislation but when one considers the central theme of it, one can see it is hugely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, which will give force of law to the convention drawn up on the use of information technology for customs and excise purposes between EU countries, should prove very useful. I hope it will result in a greater curb on illegal drug traffickers and those engaged in other illegal activity. Whatever about Ireland's unique features as an island nation and the many good things it has going for it, from an international <Col N="613" /> security point of view, it must be a haven for anyone who wishes to traffick illegally in drugs, etc. It has probably a longer coastline in proportion to its size and population than any other country. It must be a nightmare to police the shoreline and this is something which has come to our notice on more than one occasion over the years. Given the ruggedness of the coastline, it must be extremely difficult to have any sort of land or sea supervision. It is, therefore, very important that some of the provisions in the Bill work.</P>
    <P>The greatest scourge of this country is the drugs problem. During my many years as a Member of this House I have seen a great amount of legislation enacted, all with the best of intentions. The problem as always is that anybody who wants an illegal drug can get it. Where there is a will there is a way and that has been the case through the years. Whatever about the distribution chain, which is a different issue, the supply chain is alive and well. Given the technology that has become available over the years it is difficult to understand why there has not been a more concerted effort and integrated approach because those involved in drug trafficking, no matter where they come from, must be known to a police force or customs officials somewhere in the world.</P>
    <P>There is nothing secret in the world. The key question is linking information and technology and the way they are used. The Bill could be extremely useful. When I hear of drugs seizures off our coastline I think of how blessed we are to have the personnel and agencies required to curb this activity. However, I am around long enough to know that for every seizure made many more get through and the agencies involved will agree.</P>
    <P>There were high profile seizures over the past year or two for which the relevant authorities should be commended but the problem is that, despite such seizures, large amounts of drugs still get through. It does not matter which constituency one represents as there is now a drug culture in the smallest towns and villages. We should spend day and night in the House considering initiatives to cut off the supply line.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers a number of other areas but if we were to effect greater seizures against drug traffickers, who are the worst people imaginable, it would be worthwhile. No words can describe the people involved in drug trafficking and no penalty would be too severe. The legislation covers hot pursuit across borders but if the individuals involved can be apprehended anywhere we will have done a great day's work.</P>
    <P>Our society must come to grips with the problem. All aspects of the drug distribution chain must be monitored, including small-time drug pushers, although that is a debate for another day. The only hope is to cut off the supply line through whatever surveillance means are necessary, utilising an array of State agencies. The agencies could then liaise internationally with similar bodies. A great deal could be done using the databases that are available which could never even have been contemplated before. The Bill aims to utilise such information <Col N="614" /> technology and I hope more countries will sign up to the convention. If there could be a reasonable clampdown on illegal traffickers it would be a job well done.</P>
    <P>There are other illegal traffickers on the high seas, including alcohol and tobacco smugglers. These activities impinge on the economy. Potential jobs are lost and the Exchequer loses out in terms of taxes. I am extremely impressed by the operations of the Customs National Drugs Team to date. The team comprises a staff of 85 but they can only be motivators because if they do not get the co-operation of a variety of other agencies they will not win the war. I assume the 700 Customs and Excise officials are an integral part of this massive movement.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners seems to be on a better footing than it was previously. There was no reason for an information deficit between them in this area.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long coastline. There are only eight ships in the Naval Service and they were deployed in the field of fishery protection originally. In this technological era extra responsibility could be given to the naval fleet. I do not wish to give the Naval Service more work but it is in an important role to help in the drive against drug trafficking. It is likely that the number of ships in the Naval Service will increase in the years to come. I am spokesperson on the marine for my party and the problem remains that the service is not in a position to prevent foreign trawlers from fishing illegally in Irish waters. The Naval Service has a huge role to play and I ask the Minister of State to refer to that when he replies. How much will the Naval Service be involved in future? Is it represented on an overall co-ordinating committee? What equipment is used on the naval vessels to help in the fight against drug trafficking?</P>
    <P>I compliment the Criminal Assets Bureau. It is good to read about high powered people losing their ill-gotten gains. The CAB has an important role to play. The only problem is that the criminals must be caught first before their assets can be seized. The relationship between the CNDT, the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service in the battle against drug trafficking will decide whether the battle will be won or lost.</P>
    <P>I refer to co-operation between trade associations, independent companies or anybody involved in the movement of goods. It is similar to a whistleblower's regime and it is a great idea. They also act as eyes and ears for State agencies. I was not aware of that and I would like to know more. That is similar to asking every law abiding citizen to help the Garda Síochána for the reason of keeping down the rate of crime. I assume that is what is behind it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the type of associations involved and the level of their involvement? Why do they do it? I assume there is a certain level of self-interest because if this could be built on, it would make the smugglers' <Col N="615" /> attempts much more difficult. Many more pairs of eyes than usual would be watching them.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by the section and I would like to know more about it. If I interpreted the provision properly, it appears that a case can only proceed to the European court if it has been heard in the Supreme Court. I assume the purpose of this is to expedite the number of cases heard here, although I presume there are more detailed legal reasons for it.</P>
    <P>People involved in money laundering are extremely good at their job. I understand the technical aspects of money laundering are breathtaking. It was explained to me recently by a member of the security forces that there is no known limit on what money launderers can do. It involves a web of deceit from the top to the bottom and anything that would put an end to it would be extremely useful.</P>
    <P>No other country involved in this agreement would be more aware of the sensitivities involved in hot pursuit than Ireland because of the Border. In common with other Members, I would not like unwarranted intrusions across the Border. This view would be shared by most of the Deputies present. However, when the national interest was at stake with regard to smuggling, many difficult choices had to be made. For example, if a strict regime had not been in place during the BSE crisis over the past four or five years, there would be even more problems now.</P>
    <P>It depends on what we are trying to stamp out. If a drugs baron was in the process of dumping illegal and damaging drugs that would affect the lives of thousands of young people, I would not be too worried about the borders I crossed in order to nail him. This is putting it at its simplest, but many people throughout Europe would share that view. I am aware of different cultures and that countries approach issues differently, but the great common denominator now is a desire to stop drug trafficking. Wherever one goes in the world, most societies are against drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Ireland is opting out of the hot pursuit provision. I have an open mind on the issue, but I would have thought that if it came down to brass tacks it would be a chilling experience for everybody concerned if a person escaped just because a border could not be crossed. I assume other measures can be put in place to counterbalance that decision.</P>
    <P>There are many other reasons that the Bill should be implemented successfully, such as international terrorism. This is on the increase and it always amazes me when I hear that semtex has been smuggled into Ireland. I assume it cannot be smuggled in easily, but it appears to arrive anyway. Anything that would enable people involved in such smuggling to be apprehended would be hugely important.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper on Defence stated there was no case to be made for broadening the role of the Naval Service. This is difficult to understand, particularly in the context of this <Col N="616" /> Bill and the actions the Minister proposes to take. I do not understand why the role of the Naval Service should not be broadened. Is it the case that one Department does not know what another is doing? It is important that the Departments of Defence, the Marine and Natural Resources and Finance reconsider that matter. I do not know what the review committee on the White Paper intended when it mentioned not broadening the role of the Naval Service. It would be extremely difficult to argue against broadening its role in the context of the Minister's proposals.</P>

There will be much discussion about it and vested interests will be interested in it. If there is any sense in the country, it will be regarded as important legislation, provided that it is enforced properly. All the various groups do different jobs, but the idea is to pull them together under this umbrella to achieve the desired result. If that happens, the Minister will have done a good day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill which I welcome. The world has become a smaller place and we hear about the globalisation of trade. However, there has also been a globalisation of drugs and arms trafficking and other forms of international organised criminal activity. This has increased greatly over the past number of years. Deputy Noonan mentioned the Mafia in the former Soviet bloc and how that is now operating in the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>In recent years there have been many massive seizures of drugs. Most of these have taken place in the south of Ireland because there are many inlets along that coast. Drugs are brought in by boat from as far away as South America, South Africa, southern Europe and other parts of Europe. However, with increased co-operation with police forces across the world, Customs and Excise, the Garda and the Naval Service have done a terrific job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also mentioned international co-operation in the context of criminals in Ireland who, when they were pursued by the Criminal Assets Bureau, left the country and set up shop in Holland. They carried on their businesses without any apparent interruption in their trade. This is evidence of international co-operation in illicit trades in addition to legitimate trades. Irish customs officials have played an important role in seizing drugs shipments and in breaking up sup<Col N="617" /> ply networks by their vigilance on the Border and along our coastline. The Naval Service deserves praise also in ably assisting the customs service in this work, especially off the south coast. The Garda Síochána has also taken an active role in that area. This integrated approach by the law enforcement agencies, both at domestic and international levels, is the only way of guaranteeing successful action against the drug barons and those who work for them in the illicit drugs and armaments trades.</P>
    <P>As with every other aspect of life, prima donnas are operating in the law enforcement branches and they must be removed for the common good. An easy approach should not be taken towards such individuals who are causing a lack of co-operation among the agencies I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Since the Memorandum of Understanding was established on 12 June 1996, a joint task force between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners has resulted in arrests and the seizure of a substantial quantity of drugs. Without such co-operation these successes would not have been as great as they have been. This co-operation must be cemented and not allowed to weaken.</P>
    <P>Changes in EU border controls, due to the Schengen protocol &ndash; which does not apply to Ireland or the United Kingdom &ndash; have provided great benefits to the travelling public throughout Europe. Unfortunately, these changes have also brought about great opportunities for traffickers in illicit drugs and arms. To control the situation as effectively as possible, more information must be made available between the various EU law enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>The Bill relates to two international conventions which must be given the force of law before Ireland can adopt them at EU level. The Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes, signed in 1995, provided for the establishment of the customs information system. This is a central data base into which each EU member state has a link. All kinds of information, including commodities, transport, business, data on persons, fraud trends and the availability of expertise, will be available in that database. George Orwell's &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; character in <i>1984</i> is increasingly coming to pass, given that information is now universally available on nearly everything that everybody does.</P>
    <P>Much of this information is vitally important and necessary to curb the growing threat to our communities posed by drug and arms traffickers. It is paramount, however, that the information contained in this database remains secure. It must not be available to those who could misuse the data contained therein. Realistically, people will obtain information to which they are not entitled, but best practice must be adhered to in order to ensure the security of such data. It should be accessible only to those who have a right to see it.</P>
    <P>Questions will be asked as to what information on individuals will be kept on this database. Will <Col N="618" /> it include details of personal taxation, health status or personal history? People have the right to pose such questions and I am sure the Minister will be able to elucidate on that matter in his reply. What role will the new convention play on money laundering and white collar crime? The Minister may also have some comments to make on these subjects in his reply.</P>
    <P>The second instrument covered by the Bill is the Customs Co-operation Convention. Every right-thinking individual will understand and accept that co-operation between customs administrations to combat trafficking in illicit drugs, weapons and ammunition, is only right and proper. Doubts will, of course, be expressed as to the manner in which that co-operation will be enforced. Some five rules have been outlined, including hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance, control delivery, court investigations and joint speciality investigation teams.</P>
    <P>As the Minister outlined, member states can opt out of hot pursuit, cross-border surveillance and covert investigations, and Ireland has decided to opt out of those forms of co-operation. Given our history, some of those forms of co-operation would not be acceptable to the population in general. In time, however, one never knows what might occur. Current events and the historical context may change so that such forms of co-operation may be invoked in future. The Bill allows a Minister to do so by order.</P>
    <P>The measures being introduced by this Bill are desirable and necessary. The common good is the most important factor for us to home in on at this time when everything is turning in the direction of international trade. The only way of controlling the illegal trade in drugs and munitions is through co-operation between the European Union's law enforcement agencies. I welcome the Minister's statements and I wish him well in steering the Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill which is an enabling measure to give the force of law to two EU conventions and three related instruments prior to Ireland adopting them at EU level. The important factor is how such conventions and regulations are to be implemented when they come into force. Financial resources must be made available to implement both conventions once the Bill has been enacted and the measures have been formally adopted. Too often in the past we have seen Bills being passed by the House, yet sufficient resources are not always made available for the proper implementation of such legislation. The Department of Finance should ensure adequate funding for the various Departments to implement such measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister said that international crime was very big business and that is certainly the case. It is unfortunate, if understandable, that when so much money is to be made illegally, many Irish men and women are at the very heart of this international crime network. <Col N="619" /> We regularly read about the godfathers of crime operating in this country. When pressure was put on them, many of them departed, especially after the death of Veronica Guerin, and went to England, and other places, especially the Netherlands. We now read, especially in the Sunday newspapers, of the high life they lead abroad having made millions out of international crime, especially drug trafficking. The most concerning aspect is the problems they left behind. Drug trafficking has caused major problems for families and has brought untold hardship, misery and social problems which have split up families and, in some cases, have caused the death of young people through drug overdoses or continual drug taking. It is unfortunate that the godfathers of crime were allowed to walk the streets unhindered for so long before action was taken. I am glad the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government have continued to take strict action against such people.</P>
    <P>It is good that there will be co-operation across the borders of the EU and further afield to deal with this problem. It is also important that there is an exchange of views and that the information customs people in different countries have is made available and that the experience of which the Minister spoke gained by customs people in different countries over the years is pooled along with resources being provided to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>It is difficult in a country such as Ireland to deal seriously with drug trafficking because of its many miles of coastline. It is almost impossible to have customs people at every entry into Ireland, but it is important that we have enough such people at the major ports of entry. Reference was made to Dublin Airport through which some 14 million people pass and that figure is increasing. It is important adequate numbers of customs people are stationed there.</P>
    <P>I come from Wexford, a coastal county, and more than one million people pass through Rosslare every year. The customs people there, in conjunction with the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the general public, are doing a tremendous job. Over the past few weeks, people entering the country with large quantities of drugs have been apprehended and I hope they will be properly dealt with by the courts. In a time of plenty, it is important that more resources, money and staff are made available to the customs people in Rosslare to deal with this problem. While they do a tremendous job, we cannot take things for granted and it is important that extra staff, modern technology and dog units are made available on a wider scale to the customs people in Rosslare.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when the Minister replies he might comment on the co-operation between Customs, the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners. One sometimes thinks they oppose rather than co-operate with each other. They all like to claim credit for apprehending people but it is important <Col N="620" /> that co-operation continues to the utmost at all main port entries to ensure the godfathers of crime are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I question the role of the Navy, and this is not a criticism. Deputy Connaughton and others referred to the number of naval ships. We have about 100 miles of coastline in Wexford, yet we never see the Navy. Perhaps we are not supposed to, but it never seems to call to Rosslare or Wexford or any other major port in the region. That is a pity because it is important that there is greater public awareness of the role of the Navy and the great work it does. While I know it must be out at sea working, courtesy calls, getting to know people and explaining its role to people are very important. Without the co-operation and support of the public, we cannot be successful in dealing with the drug trafficking problem. Perhaps the Minister might comment on the role of the Navy.</P>
    <P>Regarding some of the issues raised, we obviously want to see the boot put firmly into people suspected of bringing drugs through ports of entry, and Deputy Noonan referred to this earlier. However, there is a difficulty in Rosslare, which I am sure exists in other ports of entry, with the arrival of refugees. It is not a problem, but I would not like refugees who have had to come here for political reasons or because of fear in their countries being dealt with similarly to those suspected of importing drugs. There should be a major difference between how Customs deals with refugees coming through ports of entry and people suspected of carrying illegal drugs. It is a concern that, once these laws are put in place and the heavy hand of the law is applied, people are seldom treated differently. Customs deals effectively with most cases but the case of refugees should be examined.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain in more detail how the joint international investigations will work across borders? For historical and other reasons, it is a very sensitive issue in Ireland. Most of the public would not take kindly to hot pursuit and cross-Border surveillance, and I am glad the Government is considering an opt-out.</P>
    <P>How will the information on the database be kept secret? There are certainly no secrets since the introduction of modern technology. When information is on a database, it is very difficult to keep it secret. What personal details will be kept on the database? If a person's personal details are kept on the database despite the fact that he or she does not have a case to answer, how can he or she have those details removed from the database? There are many cranks and people who will make untrue and incorrect claims against others with the result that some people may find their personal details on the database when they travel from one country to another despite their not having committed a crime. How will it be ensured that will not happen and what redress exists if it does?</P>

Ba mhaith liom go mbéadh gach Bille eile atá ós ár gcomhair leagtha amach i nGaeilge freisin. I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister and those responsible for drafting the Bill on the comprehensive and extensive explanatory memorandum included with the Bill to help us understand it. It was very helpful to me and I appreciate it. It is a pity others responsible for drafting Bills do not emulate this.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should be seen to co-operate in every possible way with our EU partners to eliminate or prevent drug trafficking and any other organised criminal activities at international level. We rely on Customs and the Revenue Commissioners in conjunction with the Garda to prevent and protect us from drugs reaching users. For that reason, it is essential that information and co-operation take place between member states.</P>
      <P>As an island with a difficult coastline, Ireland is particularly vulnerable and accessible to those who wish to use this country as a base through which to transport drugs from South America to Britain and on to the Continent. Much good work has been done by all the agencies involved to prevent such smuggling of drugs and other materials, particularly tobacco and alcohol. Last year genetically modified seeds were smuggled into Ireland for trial purposes. If one adds trafficking in people one can understand how complex the situation is for the agencies burdened with the responsibility of trying to combat this problem. This legislation will be very worthwhile if it helps to combat these movements.</P>
      <P>The Bill is complex in that it deals with all the conventions and regulations involving other countries. However, it is important that we show our commitment by introducing enabling legislation and that we do our utmost at local level to combat trafficking and other criminal activities, whether onshore or offshore.</P>
      <P>I support the five main provisions of the Bill which enables intensive co-operation between EU customs administrations aimed at counteracting the international smuggling of drugs and so on. There is ample EU legislation, regulation and conventions but I am concerned about the meaningful implementation of these measures.</P>
      <P>It is important to update and take advantage of new technology through the establishment of a computerised customs information system which will be a significant benefit to Ireland and our EU partners. Where will this centre of technology and information be based? Given our expertise in information technology, Ireland could have a legitimate claim to be the location for this centre which would be a great advantage. I do not know if this is possible but perhaps the Minister of State will refer to it in his reply. It would be a good example of decentralisation from Europe to a peripheral country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding all the legislation, it is important to enforce these measures at local <Col N="622" /> level. There is significant pressure on the agencies involved, not only to keep pace with, but to get ahead of the criminals. The Garda drugs squads, the Naval Service, Customs and Excise and the Revenue Commissioners have all played an important role.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible tragedy that heroin is now available in Galway city and a few addicts are being treated on a voluntary basis in the Western Health Board area. This is a new development and until recently the Garda drugs squad in Galway was doing tremendous work. However, this squad was reduced by 40% to provide gardaí for other duties. As a result, this unit must be deflated and must question the commitment of the Government and legislators to provide funding, personnel and whatever else is needed to combat serious drug activity in the west.</P>
    <P>Dublin used to be the hub of the illicit drugs trade but that is no longer the case. This is not a result of technology but the fact that suppliers have found it an advantage to move elsewhere, particularly to the west. The Shannon is an artery through which drugs are smuggled into Ireland and on to Britain or the Continent. We have identified this problem so I cannot understand why we have not provided the agencies with the wherewithal to strike hard at this obvious target. We have one Garda patrol unit but I do not know where it is. How can it effectively curtail, never mind prevent, drug barons using this gateway into Ireland and mainland Europe?</P>
    <P>Many speakers, including the Minister of State, referred to the pressure on the Naval Service to target the fishing industry because of the amount of poaching and other illicit activities taking place in that industry. The service is over-burdened concentrating on this industry, never mind the need to prevent other criminal activities taking place.</P>
    <P>This leaves Customs and Excise and the Revenue Commissioners which we must compliment for their activities. How can these agencies participate in the co-ordinating task force on a par with other agencies if they do not have the wherewithal to be effective in their own areas of responsibility? The task force is referred to in the case of major drugs finds on land or at sea and there is a rush by one or other of the agencies to take credit for the success by displaying the haul. That is fine, whether it be the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners, Customs and Excise or the Naval Service, but where does this type of behaviour leave the overall co-ordination of the task force? It is difficult to regularise the sentiments when all four agencies take responsibility for the haul. Before we look to Europe, there is a need for far greater co-ordination in Ireland with regard to our involvement. Basically, it is the information we are talking about being available, abroad and internally, for others to use. I am highlighting the internal difficulties and the need for a far greater input to give all the people involved in it, a reasonable response capability. I am not taking from their efforts to date. They <Col N="623" /> have done a tremendous job. Let us give them the wherewithal to improve and continue their work.</P>
    <P>On the question of adhering to the provisions of the Bill, I imagine there are difficulties to overcome if we are to provide a meaningful response. Much of the Bill is aspirational. Can we really match the sentiments with the necessary activity?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to comment on the possibility that there would be greater concentration by the Garda on surveillance of the River Shannon. It is necessary to warn all involved that we are only nibbling at the edges of the trade in illegal drugs and other smuggled products. As the speaker from this side of the House who preceded me asked, for every one who is caught, how many get through? We do not really have information on that and maybe, through this involvement, we will get that information, which would help the Government in targeting resources to respond to that need.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 which deals with five areas of involvement, the State may opt out of three of the areas. I am open to correction, but it appears that only eight of the 15 EU member states will adopt these conventions and similar legislation because of difficulties in the provision of domestic legislation. It will mean there will be only 50% co-operation. How effective can such legislation be? This proposal is mandatory in only two areas. The areas to which the Minister referred related to hot pursuit, which is a sensitive issue in Ireland, but at the same time we must face up to the reality. Why have we not taken on board the comprehensive package? Why have we opted out in particular instances? Is it that we are afraid that it will be seen that the Garda co-operate with the RUC? There is no doubt that we are co-operating wholeheartedly with the RUC on the interchange of information? Is it that if the hot pursuit related to a military matter, for example, the idea of the British Army in pursuit of somebody on our territory would be repugnant to us? It would be a pity if that was the reason we proposed to opt out. The other areas would not be as sensitive in Ireland. However, if only eight EU member states participate and we talk about opting out of certain areas, and maybe at a later date seeing our way to coming on board, this must cast doubt on our sincerity and commitment to the ideals of this legislation. I hope in his reply, the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, will give legitimate realistic reasons for choosing to opt out in that area because some people might otherwise put a spin on it.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support wholeheartedly the provisions of the Bill and hope it will have a speedy passage here. I also hope that by its implementation we can co-operate with others in the databank within Europe to address serious crime.</P>
    <P>Is it not difficult for the Minister to accept that, for instance, less than half a mile from the House one can see throngs of people seeking to purchase illicitly at knock down prices, a product such as tobacco which is widely available in huge quantit<Col N="624" /> ies? The same applies with alcohol. The terrible aspect of it is that there is among the population, no more than in the area of drugs, people who are prepared to deal on the black market or on the shady side of trade. The most reputable managers and owners of institutions, hotels and pubs are prepared to seek illicitly imported goods out of view of the Revenue Commissioners and Customs officers. In the past ten or 20 years, some people considered tax evasion a great opportunity to prove a point. In the same context, we are seeing that people are more or less proving a point, that they can have access to alcohol and cigarettes from dubious sources. There are many other substances involved. While there is such an overall ethos within society, we must give full support to all the agencies involved, to eliminate the practice once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously that is going on to some extent. I am not so naive that I would believe that everybody tries to run a straight house but if it is as bad as the previous speaker suggested, maybe he might provide information to the people in a position to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the last few speakers, I think there is broad support for the Bill. It is not contentious. People appreciate the changes which have taken place not just in Ireland but throughout Europe and recognise how sophisticated criminals have become. More importantly, they recognise the vast amounts of money being made from crime.</P>
      <P>A number of my colleagues mentioned that when the heat was on, some of the criminals here &ldquo;upped sticks&rdquo; and headed for some of the sunnier spots in Europe. They appear to be living on the fruits of crime and enjoying life to the full. As we are in a European Community, it is important that we co-operate in every possible way to make life as difficult as we can for these people. They have made vast profits and have left behind terrible misery for the thousands of young people who are addicted to drugs and for their families who must endure terrible suffering as a result of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the first person in this House to understand or appreciate the seriousness of the situation was Deputy Gregory. I remember seeing him on television explain the difficulty as he saw it. People felt he was exaggerating the problem and that it only applied to Dublin. However, we have woken up and realise that it is a problem affecting every village and town and not just Dublin. Unfortunately, despite the resources that have been made available, the problem has got worse instead of better. We have a very serious <Col N="625" /> fight on our hands if we are to fight the battle against drugs.</P>
    <P>The exchange of intelligence and information to combat international smuggling of drugs and other items is something which any decent person would support. In the past, we have had a very ambivalent attitude towards co-operating with the Garda. However, attitudes have changed in relation to tax evasion and, more recently, to drink driving. For a long time, those who could drink and drive were looked on as being hard men. That attitude has changed and today they are looked on as being very foolish and reckless and there is a big price to be paid if they are caught. Attitudes have changed, maybe more so among young people. In my experience, it is old people who find it more difficult to change. Young people are much more mature in dealing with that type of situation. People now decide not to drink if they are driving or to take a taxi.</P>
    <P>Just as we have succeeded in changing the attitudes of young people through education and by highlighting at every opportunity the dangers of drink driving, it is important that we try to change the attitudes of people in terms of showing more faith in the Garda and of being more co-operative with them when dealing with the drug problem. We have a difficulty with &ldquo;squealing&rdquo; or &ldquo;ratting&rdquo; on people; we think it will mean they will be prosecuted or that they will finish up behind bars.</P>
    <P>We could send someone out in any town and within 60 minutes, one could be guaranteed he will have found a place where he can get drugs. It is no great secret and if one talks to people in any town, one will quickly identify the people who are pushing drugs or where they are available. It is important that we change people's attitudes and try to explain to them how serious the drug problem is and that we must work together. The Garda cannot work in isolation and it is only with the provision of information and intelligence, if you like, that they will succeed in this battle against drugs. While this co-operation throughout Europe is very welcome, maybe we should look to home and realise how important it is to try to fight the battle at home.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there are huge profits to be made from selling drugs or else people would not take the risks they now take. I met a women recently whose son is serving a five year prison sentence. He was only a young chap at school when, unfortunately, he got tangled up in the drugs scene and ran up a debt with his pusher. He was invited to travel abroad to bring home some drugs in order to offset the debt he had with the pusher. Maybe fortunately &ndash; he might have thought unfortunately at the time &ndash; he was caught, convicted and is now serving his time behind bars. That young chap, who was obviously naive in many respects, made two mistakes. He got involved with drugs, got hooked and was not able to pay for what he was using. To pay off his debt, he decided to bring some home. Now he is paying a heavy price. Maybe if he has learned his lesson, it will have <Col N="626" /> been worthwhile. That is not an isolated incident, there are plenty of similar stories &ndash; indeed, our prisons house many people like that chap.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a greater concentration on advertising the dangers of drugs, particularly in primary and second level schools. We have what I would consider a haphazard approach to dealing with the issue, particularly at school level. Parents' councils have been quite active and a couple of families from England have visited on a number of occasions and have spoken to children. In one case, a family lost their child who took an Ecstasy tablet. When the parents relive the nightmare of the death of their child it has an effect on those who are listening but very often, those who attend such meetings or seminars are not the people to whom we really need to talk. We must have a more intensive campaign in dealing with the drugs issue and we need to explain to young people the damage that can be done if they get hooked on drugs.</P>
    <P>There are different reasons people become involved in the drugs scene and one is a lack of options. Many teenagers today will say they are bored. Maybe teenagers 20 or 30 years ago were bored but they always managed to find something with which to amuse themselves. We have to realise that the country is changing and that the demands on young people are changing. It is important that we provide proper facilities for young people.</P>
    <P>Each day we see young people hanging around towns and, in some cases, loitering. Perhaps they do not mean any harm but it can upset old people, in particular, who feel frightened when walking past groups of young people. That is not a nice way for old people to feel and maybe we should look at that issue more seriously.</P>
    <P>To go back to the Bill itself, we are dealing with the exchange of intelligence and information to combat international smuggling. I spoke recently to a retired English bookmaker, who was explaining the major changes that have taken place in the bookmaking industry in England, particularly on the tracks. He said that very few bookmakers who operated ten or 20 years still operate. In their eyes, the bookmaking business in Britain was used, to a large extent, to launder money and a great deal of drugs money had come into the industry. That is unfortunate, but it gives some indication of the millions of pounds that are spent on drugs and the huge profits for those involved in the drugs trade. I do not have any evidence that the same applies here. I know many of the bookmakers here. Some of the faces have been operating for a long time and I am sure will continue to operate for some time to come.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, most people who get hooked on drugs start off with the best intentions but find that, apart from their work suffering, a salary is seldom able to pay for the cost of the drugs and they often have to turn to crime. While we welcome the reduction in crime in the past 12 months, none of us could be happy with the current level of crime. Unfortunately, a great deal of <Col N="627" /> crime is related to the drugs problem and people robbing to feed their addictions.</P>
    <P>Regarding Customs and Excise, I pay tribute to the people who have had a difficult job trying to police the coast of our island country. Ireland's geographical location makes the job more difficult than for our European neighbours. As an island off the coast of Britain, with the United States on the other side, it is a perfect location for people to break down their drugs and send them on to the rest of Europe. While we can be happy with the vigilance and the number of drugs seizures and convictions in the past few years, this merely indicates the amount of drugs that has been brought into the country illegally. In a small country such as this, only so much resources can be made available to deal with the problem. It would be virtually impossible to police the entire coast. It is important that we continue to provide a service at our main ports. It is obvious that much of the international co-operation and exchange of intelligence is working, in that people are able to identify the culprits and pick them up when they arrive here.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all who are fighting this difficult battle. It is only when we read about some of the large seizures that we realise and appreciate the tremendous work they do. It is like a war in which we are trying to save lives. The Bill is a welcome move. It is a follow-on from the co-operation we have had since we became a member of the European Union. However, with the availability of modern technology, we should exercise the maximum co-operation with our colleagues in dealing with this difficult problem. I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill and I hope it has a quick passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The first line of the explanatory memorandum refers to international smuggling, including drug smuggling. Much of the focus of this debate to date has been on drugs. This is symptomatic of every Deputy's concern about the menace of drugs. Every provincial town and small community has felt the impact of drugs. Many of us, whether from rural or urban Ireland, are often told, by name, of people who are involved in drug peddling within their areas. Parents are very concerned about the activities of the people involved, perhaps on a small-time basis, but who are often classified as drug pushers. These people have become more sophisticated with the use of mobile phones. The main problem for the gardaí &ndash; even where Garda officers are involved &ndash; is the difficulty of pinning down these people and finding them with the drugs. In many cases they use younger people, even people under 18 years of age, to distribute the drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem concerns every Member and parent, especially those with teenage children. Previous speakers spoke about how teenagers use their time, and said they probably do not use it in the same way teenagers did in the past. Society has changed dramatically, with the influence of <Col N="628" /> television, and so on. Young people today are at a loose end as to what to do with their time. Regrettably, the pub culture has taken over. While in the past young people met in youth clubs, young people today meet in public houses. That goes back to the debate we had yesterday on a national stadium. The priority for Newcastle West would be an open swimming pool, with the possibility of covering it. That would cost millions of pounds but it would be a great advantage to Newcastle West.</P>
    <P>Deputies said there should be more activities in local areas. The point was well made in terms of what £1 billion would provide in amenities countrywide. The point was also made that with 166 Deputies, one is talking about spending approximately £5 million per Deputy, which would provide a great deal of the infrastructure. As a result of that, many of the criticisms of our young people might dissipate because they would have other places in which to display their energies.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the death of the columnist, Veronica Guerin, woke up people with regard to the drugs problem. She was, therefore, the catalyst as far as we, as parliamentarians, were concerned in forcing through much legislation to take on the drug barons about whom she often wrote. Many of those drug barons have been taken out of circulation. I compliment the initiative taken in setting up the Criminal Assets Bureau, and the vision of people like Barry Galvin who was prepared to get involved and expose many of those involved in drug activities on a large basis. However, as soon as these people are taken out of circulation, there are other players, perhaps on a smaller scale, to take their place. Places like Amsterdam are probably the cockpits for the distribution of drugs throughout Europe and back to Ireland. The drugs problem is a major one.</P>
    <P>In terms of international drugs smuggling, we must examine this Bill in the context of what is happening in Europe. There have been many laudable effects such as the exchange of information and intelligence between countries. I have no doubt but that some of the larger drug seizures were due to such intelligence.  I believe it is impossible to control drug smuggling into this country. Despite the savage weather conditions that often prevail, our coastline is a haven for drug smuggling and we are an international base for such activity.</P>
    <P>The seizure of the <i>Brime</i> and £20 million worth of cannabis was hailed as a tremendous success. It was said as part of the evidence given at that time that one of the reasons Ireland was so attractive for international drug smuggling was the level of policing, particularly along the coast. We have a flotilla of eight ships, most of which are involved in fishery protection. I understand there will be greater pressure in this areas because targets will be set which will involve our fleet spending 220 days at sea and boarding at least 400 vessels per year. We are in a difficult position as regards fishery protection. Some 400 <Col N="629" /> trawlers operate in the exclusive zone each day. Our white fish stock is considerably reduced and we have conservation problems. In many instances fishermen get grant assistance for vessels that enable them to go out further and fish for exotic species. Even such fish are now becoming scarce. Our naval fleet must go out more than 200 miles from our coastline in order to monitor what is happening with regard to blue whiting and tuna.</P>
    <P>When one looks at our naval fleet and compares it to the European model, every European country with a coastline has a fleet averaging 81 vessels. Each vessel in our fleet patrols 30,000 square miles but in other European countries it is an average of 1,500 to 2,000 square miles. To put the Irish naval vessel in context, it is the equivalent of having one patrol car for the entire country. There is a daunting prospect facing us. According to the international convention we must cover .25 million square miles, 20% in European Union waters. Our fleet is minimalist compared to that of our neighbours.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence stated there was no maritime threat to this country. While that may be so there are other threats, one of which is international smuggling. Those involved in that activity are becoming more sophisticated. I have no doubt but that despite the large drugs seizures, which I applaud and pictures of which are shown in the newspapers &ndash; in many cases assets are seized &ndash; it is the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>Take the position of nuclear submarines using our seas. We have no way of tracing them. We have ceded our sovereign rights with regard to such activity. World attention focussed recently on the unfortunate Russian nuclear submarine and the tragedy that befell those on board. Nuclear vessels pass through our seas on an ongoing basis. From time to time we hear of trawlers being sucked under the water, in some cases as a result of submarine activity. In Russia many nuclear submarines have been either mothballed or taken out of commission with the potential hazards that entails. There are serious question marks over the condition of many British submarines some of which have been recalled to port.</P>
    <P>This is a time-bomb ticking off our coastline. I hear well-deserved praise for what we are achieving but there are many gaps which would require enormous expenditure to fill. It would be worthwhile for the Government to compare our facilities with those of other European countries and how they divide their fleet to cater for fisheries protection, drug seizures and so on and see if we have a coherent policy in place. I do not believe we have one.</P>
    <P>When I was spokesperson on the marine I visited Norway and was interested in the approach they adopted. There are many lessons to be learned. We have difficulties but we are trying to cope the best way we can as a small country. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for being tolerant of me when I raised the question of the Air Corps this morning. I become emotional when I con<Col N="630" /> sider our approach to some matters, particularly when I recall the tragic loss of the four Air Corps crew on 1 July 1999 on their first day on a mission from Waterford, having flown for 16 hours and 40 minutes. They lost their lives on their first flight at night time from the Waterford airbase. There are serious questions that must be asked. They should not have been placed in a position where safety structures were not in place at the airport and where there were serious deficiencies regarding air traffic control. There were inter-departmental meetings to try to agree a call-out allowance for an air traffic controller at night time. Despite having 12 meetings, on 1 July 1999 the procedures were not in place. It is regrettable, where human life is concerned, that we sometimes have such a penny pinching attitude. It is regrettable that a basic item such as an accommodation unit at the airport, which was recommended so that the airport would be accessible to Air Corps personnel, was not provided even though everyone knew it was required. They had to stay in accommodation in Dunmore East. It is regrettable that, looking at the newspapers as I did on 2 July, even though these people died at night, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources was saying how great it would be if we had a 24 hour service throughout the country. It is regrettable that we provided a Dauphin helicopter in Waterford. Engineering personnel in the Air Corps advised about the engineering deficiencies of that helicopter for sea rescue, given our hostile coastal environment. However, that information was ignored. Is it not regrettable that spare parts often cannot be got for that particular helicopter, which was ordered in 1982 and delivered in 1986? We have five of those helicopters. One of them is still in use in Finner Camp in Donegal. In many cases, other helicopters have to be cannibalised to provide spare parts. This is an example of penny pinching in an area where safety is absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of coherent policy in regard to our Air Corps, which is used greatly in sea rescue activities. There is a lack of definition of a function which is directly under the control of the Department of the Marine, which has subcontracted it out to private operators with a sophisticated Sikorsky aircraft. We applaud the work done by the Air Corps &ndash; they are the unsung heroes of our community. However, we do not provide them with proper equipment. If we take this service seriously we should provide the proper equipment. I often wonder if there is a subplot in relation to the provision of these services, whereby the whole lot could be privatised if it were scaled down. If such an insidious plot is in place people should say so.</P>
    <P>I spoke last night to a lady who was engaged to one of the pilots. She wrote to our party leader and elaborated her concerns after having read the draft report and the complete report. She was very emotional on the telephone and cried about the senseless loss of the lives of her fiancé and the other people involved. This should never <Col N="631" /> have happened. On 1 July 1999, rather than appealing to the Minister's ego by promising a 24 hour service and reading about what a great activity it was in the newspapers the following day, a decision should have been taken at that time not to proceed with the service because the proper equipment and safety structures were not in place. People would have admired the Air Corps, the Department of Defence and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources if they had behaved responsibly in that way, but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>There has been a minimum of comment on this issue since a report was released. It is almost as if people are hiding behind it out of a sense of guilt. That is why I have asked for this report to be discussed in the Dáil and for the Minister to face questions from this side, so that we can expose the deficiencies in what happened. I look forward to that being agreed. I am sorry for digressing into that area, but I feel very strongly about it.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and will put in place legislation and mechanisms to deal with international smuggling. However, do we have the expertise and manpower to deal with the scale of the problem? My original point was that we do not and I have elaborated realistically on the reasons for that. Unless we decide a coherent policy and have an extension of the Naval Service, in terms of an extra fleet to undertake this type of policing activity, we will not be able to take on these international drug barons who are using our country as a haven for drug distribution throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with the legislation. I am sure he is also concerned about what I said about the airport in Waterford because it is in his constituency. I am sure he is aware of the facts. I am sure he has read the report, but if he had not he should read it. It is a shocking indictment of something that should never have happened, which it saddens me to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt this legislation is necessary. This matter has been ongoing for some time and it has taken a while for this Bill to be introduced. I assume it is being done in order to co-operate with our European Union partners, because the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to adopt the:</P>
      <P>EU Convention of 26 July 1995 on the use of Information Technology for Customs purposes;</P>
      <P>Agreement on Provisional application of that Convention;</P>
      <P>Protocol of 29 November 1996 on the interpretation of that Convention by the Court of Justice of the European Communities;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> Protocol of 12 March 1999 which corrects two deficiencies in that Convention; and</P>
    <P>EU Convention of 18 December 1997 on Mutual Assistance and co-operation between Customs Administrations.</P>
    <P>That is all very laudable and necessary to bring the legal fight to the drug barons who are taking every country in Europe for granted. No Member of the House could speak against the essence of this legislation, which is to help in the fight against drug traffickers. Everything that can be done in that regard should be supported by Members of this House.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine said here during a debate on law and order and justice that we have lots of legislation in this country but very little order. We are putting more legislation in place here to take the fight to the drug traffickers, but I do not know how well we are winning that fight on the ground. Order should be put in place in that regard.</P>
    <P>When Deputy John Bruton was Taoiseach during the Irish Presidency of the EU, his priority for that six months was for the EU member states to co-operate to take the fight to the drug traffickers. He stated on numerous occasions that we found it extremely difficult in Ireland to patrol our vast coastline as the Naval Service did not have sufficient patrol boats. He suggested the excellent idea of co-operation between all sectors in the EU in that regard. I assume much of this legislation has been introduced on foot of that. All our EU partners agree with that. However, it must be brought forward another step or two.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to get into a debate on drugs, they are the scourge of every community in the country. We hear this problem being highlighted in regard to the large urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, where the scourge of drugs is affecting large communities and where we are trying to deal with a large heroin problem. A great deal of time, energy and effort has been put in by Government and all political parties to try to put in place legislation and so on to reduce that drug threat.</P>
    <P>However, I live in County Leitrim, which is probably the most rural constituency. I want to make it known that drugs are also a threat in such small communities. There is not a rural community in the country which is not affected by the massive scourge of drugs. A great deal of attention is given to the problem of under age drinking. However, young people in any small town can get ecstasy tablets without any difficulty every weekend. I am not so naive as to think we can stop this, but we have to put in place some laws to make it less easy for people to get illegal drugs into our communities, both large and small.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few points from a local as well as a national perspective. I recall raising with the Minister of State's predecessor a proposal to put a drug trafficking unit on the Shannon. Replies to parliamentary questions state that a unit in Limerick deals with the Shannon. I am at the north<Col N="633" /> ern end of the Shannon which goes into the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland with the Shannon-Erne link or the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal. There has been no patrol on that area at any time and this is an area which could be exploited by drug traffickers. I have no idea whether that is happening. It is a massive expanse of inland waterway and drug traffickers could come in from Limerick and Northern Ireland. The increase in boating activity which has taken place on that inland waterway in the past couple of years is immense. That is one area that needs to be looked at seriously. The Minister's Department will have to provide the funding for a proper drugs unit to patrol the Shannon and the Shannon-Erne waterways.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter concerning the Revenue Commissioners in Sligo. We had a drugs unit in Sligo port to patrol the whole north west coast but the Department of Finance decided to move it to Limerick. I raised this issue to no avail through parliamentary questions a couple of times during the past six or seven months. In the context of this Bill, where co-operation is needed, it seems illogical to remove a drugs unit from Sligo, leaving part of the west coast which includes counties Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal with no unit. That is a massive expanse of country. As my colleague, Deputy Finucane, has said, drug traffickers might come in. It may not be the most ideal place to stop but it is the height of folly if there is no drugs unit in that area to protect the north west. I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to rescind the decision to remove the Revenue unit from Sligo. Sligo is an ideal location from which to patrol the entire north west and part of the west coast. I would appreciate if he would deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the reason for the Revenue change was to have a more co-ordinated approach. I cannot see the logic of co-ordination, given the long distance from Limerick to Donegal to Malin Head. I realise we are under pressure to patrol all our coastline but the Navy does not have the capacity to do so. A unit was in place and had made some good seizures, though not massive publicity seizures. Drug traffickers will be aware of that and will keep away from the area. Given that the unit has been removed from Sligo the drug traffickers will return. It is impossible to patrol that area from Limerick. I plead with the Minister to restore that unit to Sligo. Many parents in Sligo town have raised that issue with me. They are of the view that the unit did excellent work and they were happy that it existed. A number of drug traffickers were found bringing drugs into the area. The people of Sligo are of the view that they have been abandoned in their fight against drugs. It is impossible to patrol the entire north-west coast from Limerick. Given that the unit was in place and the people on the ground were patrolling the area, it may be easier to put it back in place than to put in a whole new unit. I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> While I am digressing a little from the Bill which is all about co-operation in Europe, a number of speakers have made the point that there should be more co-operation on the ground here. I congratulate the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service who have done some excellent work. This is legislation on which no political party has a better say than anybody else; we are all in this together. I merely wish to highlight deficiencies in the system with a view to resolving them together. I am not critical of this or any other Government. Given that our heart is in the right place we have to be aware of the seriousness of the drugs scourge and put in place extra finances to alleviate the problem. Co-operation between all the agencies could be better in that the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and customs are at different stages and doing their own thing. I have no proof of this, I have only read what has been reported. I have no doubt those individuals are putting their lives on the line because those with whom they are dealing have no regard for life. They will murder and cause mayhem to any society that thinks it can stop the illicit drug trade.</P>
    <P>We can take examples from co-operation in Europe and try to put them in place here. That will involve resources and work between the various agencies. I have no doubt if the Government provides the necessary finance to enable this co-operation to take place it will be easier to fight the drug barons. It is a difficult war. If the drugs problem could be resolved we would be relieved of the most awful consequences in the large provincial towns and cities which we witness daily as political representatives. If we could stop this mayhem and make it more difficult for the drug barons, this country would be a much better place in which to live. It must be a priority of Government to deal with it. If my party was in Government I would make the same plea. The necessary funding will have to be provided. It is not easy to patrol all our coastal waters. We do not have the wherewithal to do so. If the funding were provided and the structures put in place in the long-term it would relieve the social difficulties which have been experienced by a large number of people.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worthwhile. Many Members are interested in contributing to the debate because it is difficult to deal with the drugs issue. I hope the Bill has a speedy passage through the House. I doubt there will be major amendments. Co-operation is the name of the game.</P>
    <P>As legislators, we must prioritise the fight against drugs, as our European colleagues appear to be doing. If we do, it will go a long way towards stopping the mayhem that is caused among the underprivileged and socially excluded in society. They are the people who are suffering and have missed the benefits of the Celtic tiger. Theirs are the children who do not enter second or third level education and who get involved in crime. The only way to resolve their problems is to put more money into education for the disadvan<Col N="635" /> taged. In particular, we must put more money into policing our coasts and into policing the drug trafficking that takes place within this country.</P>
    <P>We know from experience that a large number of young Irish people are involved in this illicit business. It is easy to arrest the junkie who is injecting himself or herself with heroin on the side of the street, but it is more difficult to arrest the individual who is importing this mayhem into our community. The way to do that is to put more gardaí on the beat and in the drugs unit, increase the Naval Service and give greater support to the Revenue Commissioners. That will cost an excessive amount of money but if we can control the mayhem caused by drugs in our society, it would go a long way towards eliminating social exclusion and developing the society we would like to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate. I wish to make three main points to which I hope the Minister will give consideration. The first relates generally to mutual assistance between jurisdictions on customs issues, the second relates to the drugs issue and the third deals with greater co-operation in general.</P>
      <P>When I saw this Bill on the Order Paper for today, I decided to bring to the Minister's attention a matter which has caused concern and grief for many people and which I hope is not considered too far removed from the remit of the Bill. There is a complete lack of co-operation or mutual assistance in the manner in which the Revenue and Customs and Excise officials treat the lawful import of motor vehicles between jurisdictions, particularly between the North and South of Ireland. The situation has changed in recent years but, unfortunately, our regulations have not moved with the times.</P>
      <P>The booming economy has given rise to two major developments. The first is the return of many of the emigrants who were forced by economic necessity to emigrate ten or 15 years ago. The second is the job shortage which has given rise to immigrants arriving in this jurisdiction from other EU countries, particularly Britain, seeking work or in response to the many advertisements seeking workers for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 12 months I have encountered a number of cases where people from Northern Ireland have taken up job offers in this jurisdiction. They have brought with them motor vehicles they purchased lawfully in Northern Ireland but on which they are obliged to pay an exorbitant rate of duty on their arrival. It was fine to introduce these regulations when we did not have the same movement of persons and where strict enforcement of the regulations prevented people making a quick buck by importing vehicles into the State without paying the appropriate duty. Now, however, given the increased movement of persons between the two juris<Col N="636" /> dictions, the hard and fast rules regarding the ownership of motor vehicles should be relaxed.</P>
    <P>Many young women are taking up nursing or social work positions in this jurisdiction because they do not have the same career opportunities in Northern Ireland or Britain. In many cases they are young single women in their twenties who are starting their careers with a contract of employment for two to five years. That gives them the opportunity to earn money and to build up experience in their careers. Most of the cases which were brought to my attention involve women, although the situation affects men too. These women do not have houses or major assets other than a motor vehicle that was purchased in Northern Ireland or Britain. The rigorous interpretation of the rules restricting the importation of vehicles has given rise to hardship in many of these cases.</P>
    <P>There is an appeals mechanism but it takes time and is often no more than a rubber stamping of the original decision. The Minister should examine the regulations with a view to relaxing them in response to our economic boom and the increased movement of persons. We are committed to the latter in the context of our membership of the European Union. There is a need for greater flexibility particularly when people are taking up jobs in this jurisdiction. Freedom of movement means little where there is a VAT or VRT regime which is so expensive and inhibiting.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to the scourge and menace of drugs. As Ireland is the only island nation in the European Union greater consideration must be given to developing crack Customs and Excise teams and police squads for our coasts. We must have a strong resistance force to combat the importation of illegal drugs. Ireland is on the western periphery of the European Union and the EU has not been fair in recognising that our coasts are, in essence, the western border of the Union. The EU should think in terms of financing an appropriate crack squad which would ensure the Union's borders are as secure as possible against the illicit importation of drugs and other criminal assets from the USA, South America and other parts of the world. The European Union should foot the bill because what is involved is securing not only our borders but also the western peripheral border of the Union.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest challenges facing western society is the scourge of the Russian mafia and the Muslim mobs who are working to huge effect in eastern Europe, peddling drugs and other criminal assets and engaging in the trafficking of humans. That is most disturbing and requires the concentrated attention of the European Union. That attention can be given to good effect only by ensuring there is a high degree of co-operation between the various forces, including Customs, Revenue, Army and police, within the security apparatus of the European Union in its fight against this new threat from the former Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> The Minister of State spoke about unacceptable delays where cases may be pending in the European court. I accept this, but he should direct his attention at the delays in our criminal court system. Reports in today's newspapers claim that approximately 100 serious criminal charges cannot be heard because of a lack of judges and inadequate court facilities. Some 100 rape and murder charges are ready to be heard against individuals but there is an unnecessary delay in hearing them because of insufficient judges and courtroom staff. While European court judgments may be awaited, we should get our own house in order and ensure the delays in our courts system are kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>On greater co-operation between countries, the microscope must be firmly placed on co-operation between this jurisdiction and the UK, with particular reference to the Border with Northern Ireland. In the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the new political dispensation, about which we hear so much and with which we all agree, the level of co-operation is probably not advancing sufficiently to ensure the greatest results are garnered. I am referring to co-operation between the police forces and Customs and Excise forces, North and South. The Minister of State was explicit in his speech when he referred to aspects of the customs co-operation convention with which we will not accord. The Minister of State will apply the opt-out clause and states that the convention allows member states to opt out of applying some of the provisions, that is, hot pursuit, cross-Border surveillance and covert investigations. While some of the other provisions are mandatory, he said the Government proposes to avail of the opt-out provision and it will make a declaration to this effect when Ireland lodges its instruments of adoption of the convention. I wonder should we take that as a given, as the Minister of State appears to do. I would have thought, in the context of the Minister of State's speech when introducing this legislation, that this aspect might have warranted more than just a cursory four lines. I wonder about this in the context of a high degree of co-operation, North and South. In the past we have probably not given sufficient consideration to the concept of a high degree of co-operation which would involve exchanges from time to time. In the context of the Good Friday Agreement, should we go further? I venture to suggest that we should.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State is so willing to apply the opt-out clauses. If we are to engage in an adequate and appropriate fight against the scourge of drugs and the menace of the transfer of various criminal assets, including money laundering and similar shady activity, we must use the best resources at our disposal. Will the Minister of State comment on Customs and Excise co-operation between North and South, Ireland and the UK and whether there might be a facility for the secondment of our inspectors who could gain the best experience possible by work<Col N="638" /> ing hand in hand with inspectors from other jurisdictions? Perhaps there could be exchange courses or people could be seconded from one jurisdiction to another. There might be appropriate eligibility schemes which would allow for that. If we look at the very close working relationship between similar security forces in Belgium and Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg or France and Holland, for example, the Minister of State would see a far greater level of co-operation than anything envisaged between North and South. Two years on from the Good Friday Agreement we should be experiencing the same high degree of co-operation not just in relation to information, but in relation to personnel, as exists between many European jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Given that Ireland is on the western periphery of the EU, it would probably make more sense if we were to look at what the inland jurisdictions within the European Union apply by way of adequate and proper exchanges. It is unacceptable that a motorist from Northern Ireland can speed and drive with impunity between Dundalk and Drogheda, for example. If he or she is not caught red-handed here, apprehended and brought to a local Garda station, and flees across the Border at speed, which many of them do, there is little that can be done within this jurisdiction. It was reported recently in the newspapers that speeding tickets issued in Dundalk to Northern registered motorists are unenforceable. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle would know more about this than I do given his close proximity to the Border. It is quite extraordinary and unacceptable that an appropriate protocol has not been put in place to allow for fairly basic matters such as parking tickets to be mutually enforceable between the jurisdictions. How can we put our best foot forward when dealing with the drugs barons if we cannot tackle fairly simple road traffic issues?</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred to our island status and the fight against drugs, with particular reference to the Shannon which bounds my constituency in the midlands. Like previous speakers said, the scourge of drugs has infiltrated my rural constituency as has happened in almost every other constituency in the country. In relation to the Shannon being a gateway or inlet for illicit activity, what is the position regarding Waterways Ireland and its role as the overriding body dealing with the Shannon and our inland waterways? Has consideration been given to a water unit on the Shannon to tackle the drugs menace which would obviously be subject to the cross-Border Waterways Ireland Body? I hope consideration will be given to having a squad operate from the Erne to the Shannon. I would not like to think persons could travel the waterways from Northern Ireland to Munster or through my constituency without being apprehended.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider those points. My overriding concern is the ease with which the Minister invokes opt-out clauses. It is unfortunate that we on this side of the EU, almost as a matter <Col N="639" /> of course, avail of opt-out clauses under so many conventions and EU directives rather than examining them closer and making the hard decision on the basis that the consequences will be better for society. Nobody could quibble with any aspect of the transposition of these conventions into domestic law and that is why if we want the best result we should be less reluctant to, as a matter of course, apply the opt-out clauses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first heard about this Bill I thought it was good news and a move in the right direction. I thought the Minister for Finance and the EU had finally decided that cars could be bought in Europe and brought into Ireland tax free. I then read the Bill and realised this is not what was promised ten years ago. It still upsets me that when Ireland joined the EU the big carrot dangled in front of people was that they could go to Belgium, France or elsewhere, buy any car they wanted and bring it into Ireland at no additional cost. If Deputy Flanagan wanted a Mercedes he would have been able to drive from Brussels to Portlaoise and park it outside his house without incurring any extra cost. That has not happened yet because Ireland was permitted to introduced its own rules and regulations.</P>
      <P>It is time there was a European police force to deal with the drugs problem. Drugs are the greatest scourge in Ireland. They are available in every town and village and nobody should pretend otherwise. Young people tell me they go to discos every Saturday night and are offered every available drug. Drugs are now given to them for nothing to get them hooked and involved in the drug scene. Once they are hooked they become customers for life.</P>
      <P>I want to pose a question to the Minister and to the Garda. How do so many drugs get into Ireland? When one returns from a foreign trip having bought cigarettes and alcohol on the way home one can be told by Customs and Excise officials at the airport that one has 100 cigarettes, a half bottle of whiskey or a bottle of wine too much, yet huge quantities of drugs come into Ireland on a daily basis because thousands of people are addicted. Why can this serious problem not be addressed?</P>
      <P>Ireland is a member of the EU and it is time to establish a European drugs squad. It could be based in Ireland with resources drawn from all EU member states. The drugs squad would deal solely with the trafficking of drugs through every member state and would liaise with its counterparts in America and Asia. The Garda cannot do every job, given its resources. It cannot police petty and serious crime and monitor ports and airports at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People joked three years ago when I suggested the establishment of a coastal watch to monitor strange boats coming into port, particularly on the west coast. At the time many people were unemployed and coastguard stations were closing down. At least when they were open people lived <Col N="640" /> in them and when they saw strange ships off the coast they knew what was happening. I suggested the setting up of a scheme in conjunction with the Garda and I am glad that two months ago a coastal watch scheme was established in my county. People laughed when I asked for that to be set up. Everybody claimed there was not a drugs problem and that we should not talk about one.</P>
    <P>It was similar to the discussion about sex on <i>The Late Late Show</i> 20 years ago. It was as if people did not have sex in Ireland then but it was the only time the programme attracted a large audience. It is amazing how we brush many things that happen in Ireland under the carpet. We want to pretend there is not a drugs problem, yet every town, village and parish has been affected.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a garda regarding a minor incident that occurred outside my house a few weeks ago. A guy passing the house smashed the rear view mirror on my car. There were three or four people with him but one of them felt sorry for me and the gardaí arrived. When the gardaí arrested the guy responsible they asked him why he did it and he said he was frustrated and lashed out. I am not a doctor or a judge but I know what happened to him because he is not a bad young fellow. He took something that night leaving a disco and it was not a pint of Budweiser or Guinness or a cigarette. This incident involved private property but he could have lashed out at an old man or woman or a child. How many savage murders have taken place involving people who have gone off their heads because they took drugs? It is a serious issue which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should lead the campaign to establish a European police force on drugs. It should be given all the powers it needs. If members of the force want to follow a suspect into any part of Europe, whether it is Northern Ireland, England, Belgium or France, the legislation should be in place to allow them do so. The drug barons should be taken on. Lord have mercy on Veronica Guerin. She fought hard against them for two or three years before she died. On a weekly basis she identified people who were receiving social welfare payments but who had big houses and cars and had amassed huge wealth and pointed them out to the public, the Garda and politicians. These individuals generated their money from selling drugs, not ice cream or sweets. Veronica Guerin lost her life. Fine Gael was in Government at the time. We introduced the necessary legislation, rushed it through the House and the Garda was given the powers it needed. The Garda did a good job. Many of the drug barons are behind bars but like everything else once the parents have been dealt with, the sons and daughters and their associates must also be addressed. Some drug barons are behind bars but their associates on the outside continue to trade.</P>
    <P>The Government set up the Criminal Assets Bureau. Its officials can seize the property and money of drug barons if they cannot prove from where they obtained their wealth. I compliment <Col N="641" /> it and I hope its resources are increased and that it gets more staff. It started at the top and it should now move down. Men and women in every town go to the local social welfare office on a Thursday or Friday and draw benefit. Yet, people who listen to their children know that these individuals are involved in illegal drugs. They have cars registered in 2000 and in some cases they have two or three cars. It is time the Criminal Assets Bureau dealt with these people and asked them from where they acquired their wealth. How can they get £100 or £200 a week from social welfare and have two or three new cars outside their doors?</P>
    <P>The next target should be these people at the bottom. The CAB started at the top and it did a good job. It should get more resources, more assistance and more staff. It has done well and it has proven that with sufficient resources and staff, it can recoup money for the State. It has saved the State much money through the manner in which it dealt with those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the Government and the EU should consider establishing a police force to cover all parts of Europe, particularly in relation to drugs. Everybody in the European Union would favour such a force. They want people who bring drugs into their countries and destroy their children, other young people and society to be dealt with. There is nothing worse in Dublin, Westport or Cork than seeing a young person aged 17 or 18 or older walking around town in the middle of the day, staring ahead because they are under the influence of drugs. It upsets me to see these young people. It annoys me that the individuals who sell them the drugs live in the lap of luxury. Many of them have the best possible lifestyles and some of them fly in and out of the country. I know of people who spend six months in Ireland and six months in the sun abroad without any visible means of income. Nobody knows for sure how they do it. Some think they may have won the lottery while others think they get their income from shares. However, others think they may get their money from drugs. It is a scandal that this problem has not been addressed and the situation is getting worse.</P>
    <P>It was stated earlier that the crime figures are down. That is not the case. The number of reported crimes is down because many people who have petty crime committed against them or have their property damaged do not bother reporting the incident to the Garda Síochána because they feel gardaí have much more important things to do. They live with the loss and replace the property.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill, whatever powers and assistance states can give to each other must be provided. We must take on the drug barons and evil people in society. They have resources and in some cases they have protection in the form of bodyguards. What worries me and many others is that many of these people no longer have respect for life. They do not care about people or their lives. They do not care who they take out. We <Col N="642" /> often hear when nasty crimes are committed that the Garda believe they are drug related. When one hears that, one knows that bullies, gangsters, thugs and murderers are involved. They inflict terrible tragedies on families and young people. These individuals move in every circle and it is terrible that they cannot be identified.</P>
    <P>It is terrible that we cannot stop the supply of drugs into this country. Ireland is a small nation and it is a pity that resources cannot be provided at ports and airports. I suggested the idea of the coastal watch scheme a long time ago and I am glad it is now in place. However, it operates on a voluntary basis and I would like it placed on a non-voluntary basis. People should be paid to monitor the coastline. These people could encourage, help and train others on a voluntary basis, but there is a need for professionals. People should be paid to do the work because Ireland has a massive coastline. This is why so much drugs get into the country.</P>
    <P>There are problems with the fisheries and ships are patrolling, trying to stop fishermen plundering and stealing our natural resources of fish. I was in Porturlin yesterday to meet fishermen there. They are suffering daily because of the big trawlers from Spain and elsewhere that are damaging their oyster and crab pots. Nobody can do anything for them, but they say it is amazing that in the middle of the summer people are nabbed for fishing a day outside the salmon fishing season. They are brought before the courts and their nets and fish are confiscated. They are nabbed quickly because they are an easy target. Other fishermen cannot be caught as quickly because they are on big trawlers. It appears that a blind eye is turned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke about parking fines. I come from a tourism town which, in common with every other town, now has a traffic problem. During the summer, when the town is busy, one sees Northern Ireland and British registered cars double parked. People leave these cars blocking the street and go off shopping. When they return there might be a ticket on the window &ndash; it would have a ticket if it was a local car &ndash; but the people concerned tear it up and drive away. It is time that problem was addressed. Instead of putting tickets on cars registered outside the State, they should be towed away or clamped so that people have to pay to get their vehicles back.</P>
    <P>A new European police force should be established to deal with drugs. All European countries have failed to deal with them on an individual basis and it is time for new thinking and more resources in this area. Whatever information or help is needed should be provided. If a person of a shady nature was being watched coming to and from Ireland on a regular basis, that information could be given to the European police force. Individual countries could give information to each other. They would not be dependent on each other but they could watch and target certain individuals. Perhaps this would, once and for all, stop the terrible scourge of drugs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> Despite all the finds at Dublin Airport and elsewhere that we hear about on a daily basis, increasing quantities of drugs are getting into Ireland. Perhaps the Minister of State could consider a suggestion I made some time ago about drugs that are taken from criminals at airports and ports. I was amazed to learn in a reply to a parliamentary question that these drugs are put into storage and I proposed at that time that a committee, similar to the Prison Service's visiting committee, should be established and meet on a monthly basis. When the courts are finished with the evidence, the committee would oversee the public disposal of the drugs.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt people but, at the same time, it is not a good arrangement for drugs to be kept in storage. Temptation exists and drugs are a very valuable commodity. This matter should be addressed. The national media could be invited to cover the disposal of drugs from, for example, a seizure two years previously in Cork or a year previously in Dublin. The people responsible for importing them would be behind bars and the drugs could be burned in the presence of the media. This has never happened and that worries me.</P>
    <P>People did not like me making this suggestion, but there should be public accountability in this regard. I hope I will get some response to this proposal which would also demonstrate to the public that the drugs have been destroyed. They would see something being done in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Bill. All Members recognise the necessity of enacting this legislation without delay. It puts in place a legal framework for mutual co-operation on customs and excise between EU member states. The Bill will give the force of law to two EU conventions and three related instruments prior to Ireland adopting them at European Union level. The need for increased co-operation and mutual assistance in sharing information between EU member states is now more important than ever. European trade barriers are being systematically removed as European trade becomes increasingly integrated. While that is a welcome development, one of the unfortunate consequences is that illegal activity between EU states, including drug trafficking and other forms of smuggling, will become easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to highlight the large amount of drugs available at present and I also wish to comment on the resources being put in place to tackle drug trafficking by sea. Few people need to be reminded about the current levels of hard drug abuse, particularly in our capital city. Cocaine and heroin are devastating thousands of families and such drug abuse in Dublin is greater than it has ever been. Certain measures are being taken to control the problem, including the national drugs strategy which is making some progress, but <Col N="644" /> insufficient inroads are being made into combating the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>Soft drugs do not always attract the same media attention as hard drugs. This is partly because soft drugs do not constitute such a big issue in Dublin, where the abuse of hard drugs is at centre stage. I remind the House of a number of facts, however. Ireland has the highest levels of ecstasy abuse among 15 and 16 year olds in the EU. More than one in ten students in their mid-teens use ecstasy here, while almost one in five uses cannabis. Ireland also has the highest drug-related death rate in Europe.</P>
    <P>We should be reminding parents that this problem is not confined to any one sector of society. A person's address does not seem to matter because children generally are being equally exposed to recreational drug use. Most frightening of all, experimentation with such drugs is now the norm for many teenagers. Despite recent large-scale drug busts by members of the Garda drug squad, particularly in Dublin and Cork, drugs are more freely available now than ever. Every drug bust sends home the message that drugs are more difficult to smuggle into the country, yet we are still not seeing a real reduction in supply. Part of the problem is that we are an island nation, as previous speakers have stated.</P>
    <P>We had an opportunity in the recent White Paper on Defence &ndash; the first such document in the history of the State &ndash; to highlight the strategy that should be put in place to enable the Naval Service to deal with its responsibilities in the area of illegal drug trafficking. Ireland claims sovereignty over some 265,000 square miles of sea, which constitutes 16% of total EU waters. With that claim comes a responsibility that the White Paper largely ignored. There should have been a comprehensive strategy for the future of the Naval Service, yet this has not been formulated. The White Paper dismissed that service's responsibility for patrolling our seas against drug smuggling, stating that the matter was essentially a policing one. It was as if the Naval Service did not even have such a role to play.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is not receiving the finance or other resources it deserves to ensure it can play a role in reducing drug smuggling. We spend a tiny 0.1% of GDP on our Naval Service each year, which is one of the lowest percentages among European states. A country like Belgium &ndash; whose designated maritime area is more than 200 times smaller than ours &ndash; is committed to spending a higher percentage of its GDP on naval patrols than we do. In real terms, Belgium spends four times more than Ireland on its naval service, despite its much smaller coastline. Our response to tackling drug smuggling is pathetic compared to our European partners.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, I recall sailing into French waters on holiday and we were immediately stopped and boarded by a French naval patrol. Our boat was searched for drugs as if we were criminals. It took some time to convince the French patrol that we were going on holidays, <Col N="645" /> and we were only allowed to continue our journey after a thorough search of our vessel. I sometimes wonder if we are taking our maritime policing responsibilities as seriously as other European states.</P>
    <P>The Garda drugs squad is doing a fine job in Cork where between £200,000 and £300,000 worth of drugs have been seized so far this year. I appeal to the Government to expand Garda drug squads outside Dublin and Cork in order to tackle the scourge of drug abuse that is destroying so many lives in rural areas. While I welcome the Bill and hope it is swiftly enacted, we still have much to do in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank all Members who contributed on the Second Stage of the Bill. Later, I will deal in some detail with the wide range of important points made by Members. Various Members raised the issue of personal data being allowed on the CIS database. Although I will elaborate on this point on Committee Stage, for clarification purposes I wish to confirm that personal data will not be allowed in that database. I know that was a matter of concern for many Members. On Committee Stage I propose to deal with the weighty matters that have been raised during the debate. As Members have said they wish to see the Bill moved though the House quickly, it is appropriate for me to conclude Second Stage now so that we can move into the appropriate detail on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion, moved by Deputy John Bruton on Tuesday, 17 October 2000:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann mindful of the public outrage that followed the Omagh bomb atrocity in August 1998, a criminal act carried out by the Real IRA, and recognising the continuing anguish caused to the victims of this bombing by the failure to secure convictions thus far, calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="646" /> set out the action, if any, taken on foot of the enactment of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998;</P>

    <P Just="Center">outline the discussions that have taken place between the British and Irish Governments on this matter,</P>
    <P Just="Center">and recognising the excellent investigative work that is jointly taking place between An Garda Síochána and the RUC, further calls on all Members of Dáil Éireann to support the call made by both Prime Ministers for the public to assist both police forces with their ongoing inquiries through the giving of information which may help in apprehending those responsible for this crime.</P>

      <P>I agree that we in this House should again express our outrage at the Omagh bomb atrocity which happened on 15 August 1998. We must also express our concern at the failure thus far to secure convictions against those who perpetrated a dastardly and cowardly deed. We must use this and every opportunity to call on anyone who has information to come forward and bring some sense of closure to the ongoing investigations. We should never tire on the path to persuade any individual who knows anything about that day to come forward. It is only when those who have caused such heartache and deep suffering are seen to be brought to justice can such closure even begin to occur. Justice must be seen to be done for the 31 lives lost and the hundreds of lives that were changed forever on that fateful day.</P>
      <P>I stress the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; for many reasons. The main one is that I often see headlines such as &ldquo;Bombers of Omagh are not likely to go to prison&rdquo; and wonder how I would feel if I were one of those families. How would I feel two years on after having the distressing experience of being at the recent inquest? I listen to and watch news items such as the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme and wonder whether someone will react positively to some of the scenes shown and come forward to either give themselves up or give that vital piece of information that could lead to a conviction. Perhaps this is a very remote chance. Will it lead those who are frustrated at the seeming lack of progress to gravitate towards the negative path of revenge, which is a real danger at this stage? All those to whom I have talked want justice, not revenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I look to the actions that have taken place and are taking place. Huge efforts have undoubtedly been made on both sides of the Bor<Col N="647" /> der by both the Garda and the RUC. These have, as recently as yesterday, yielded more arrests. One person is before the court at present on charges pertaining to the Omagh bomb. This is progress, even if it is frustratingly slow.</P>
    <P>The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, was a measure many in the House were reluctant to see being brought into effect. However, we were all rightly appalled at such an act of wanton barbarism as Omagh. The question was asked last night as to the value and role of the Act. This seemed to ignore the fact that we passed a resolution concerning this Act late in the previous session, as was required under section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform laid before the House a report on the operation of sections 2 to 12, inclusive, 14 and 17 which covered the period from 3 September 1998 to 29 May 2000. In this respect and on a point of clarification, have Members opposite taken the opportunity to read the report, given that part of the motion being discussed requests that information be made available or are they merely seeking an update from 29 May to the present?</P>
    <P>As I understand it, according to the report laid before the House by the Minister, while no court proceedings utilising sections 2 to 9, inclusive, or 12 had yet arisen, the provisions had been employed by the Garda when investigating offences. Given that some of the sections relate to the taking of inferences from a person's silence, these, by their very nature, would not yield anything significant until such time that a person would appear in court. With regard to section 10, in the period 3 September 1998 to 29 May 2000, a period of detention was extended on 29 occasions and each detention pertained to a single individual.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be in a position tonight to update the report laid before the House earlier in the year to clarify whether the status of those who had extension orders made against them has altered given that, as of 29 May, no person who had such extension orders made against him or her had been subsequently charged with an offence, whether the number of files submitted to the law officers for direction have had decisions made on them, whether any person has subsequently been re-arrested under section 11 and whether section 17 will be invoked in the context of current developments. I also hope the Minister will put on record tonight that the Government is fully committed to having those responsible for the Omagh bomb apprehended and brought to justice and dismiss once and for all the appalling rumours and hearsay reaching us through the media in recent days.</P>
    <P>Anyone, including the Taoiseach and various Ministers, who visited the wakes and funerals of so many, young and old, would have to have an inherent will to see those responsible brought to justice. I would like to think that justice will be <Col N="648" /> seen to be done for the 31 lives lost. I trust all those who have information will come forward. I also trust that the relationships that have developed out of this great tragedy will continue to give some small comfort to all the people of Omagh, Buncrana and Spain. Truly heroic people, be they in the voluntary, professional, emergency service, clergy or other sectors, were discovered in these locations on and since 15 August 1998 and they have helped those closest to the devastation in many ways.</P>
    <P>Omagh was not the first bomb site but we trust it will be the last. Nothing should be allowed to take us off the true path to peace which exists at present. As the Taoiseach said recently in Galway, we should realise that 95% of the Good Friday Agreement has been implemented. Every effort should be made to work through the difficulties of the Patten report to ensure that this, as one of the final major fundamental issues, can be concluded and that, in this manner, normality can break out throughout Ulster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is over two years since the Real IRA's bomb devastated the centre of Omagh. Those two years have been ones during which the families of the victims and those who were injured have had to live with the consequences of mass murder and during which, as people rightly point out, the perpetrators, regrettably, have been at large. In debating this motion, this House is sending a strong message to the killers. It is our firm will that they be tracked down, however long it takes. It is our firm intention that they will be brought to justice in a court of law and that they will be held to account and, upon establishing their guilt, locked away for a very long time. We owe this not only to the people of Omagh but to all the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we pursue the bombers, let us never lose sight of exactly what they did. Earlier this month, the Belfast coroner, John Leckey, completed his inquest into the deaths resulting from the bomb. Over four distressing weeks we heard evidence of the most harrowing and difficult kind. We heard how a car was packed with explosives and driven to a busy shopping street by those too callous to care about the entirely foreseeable consequences of what they did. We heard how the timer, which could have allowed two hours to clear the streets, was set for a mere half hour, and of how the bombers thought enough about their own safety to incorporate a device to protect themselves against a premature detonation. We heard of the carnage and confusion in the aftermath of the explosion and of the extraordinary courage and heroism of the RUC officers and medical teams who sought desperately to save injured casualties or to counsel those who searched for their loved ones. The circumstances of each death were chillingly laid before us. We were reminded that, for every victim killed, countless lives were devastated and that, while the town of Omagh is slowly <Col N="649" /> recovering and rebuilding, for many the scars of that day will simply never heal.</P>
    <P>Some questioned the need for the inquest to relive the horror in such grim detail, particularly as it could not hold those responsible to account. However, I fully share Coroner Leckey's refusal to sanitise or dilute what the Real IRA did in Omagh. As he said, &ldquo;If you park a car containing up to 200 kg of explosive in a busy shopping street, set a timer and walk away, you do not walk away from responsibility for any resultant carnage&rdquo;. As he also said, the conclusion of the inquest represents the closing of a chapter, not of the book.</P>
    <P>All those who died were innocent victims, their deaths an affront to decency and democracy, bringing nothing but shame and disgrace on those responsible and on any cause they claim to represent. We are fully committed to bringing them to justice. With the support of all sides of the House, we introduced new legislation to give the Garda the extra powers it needed. Working in the closest possible co-operation with its RUC counterparts, the Garda has been professional, painstaking and thorough in its work. We would have expected no less. However, it has gone well beyond that. It has carried out its work with a conviction and determination to bring it to a successful conclusion. I strongly commend it for those efforts and for the progress it has made so far. Let it also be completely clear that this Government will never allow political considerations of any type to interfere with the course of justice.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the terms of the resolution before us which calls on any member of the public in a position to assist the police in their on-going inquiries to bring forward information that may lead to the apprehension of those responsible. That is in all our interests. In bombing Omagh, and in its other violent acts, the so-called Real IRA has pitted itself against the will of the people. The Omagh bombers and their supporters regard themselves as a higher authority than the people. They believe their stream of politics to be pure and untainted by compromise, but it is poisoned by hatred. Nothing can flow from it but death and destruction.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland, North and South, have chosen another course. They are prepared to embrace change, to move forward and to leave behind the ancient shibboleths and old certainties. They support the Good Friday Agreement and want it to succeed. They know it involves compromise but they also know that compromise is not a bad word &ndash; that it is not a defeat, but a victory for us all. Without compromise we could not have achieved the Agreement and without it we will not see the Agreement fully implemented.</P>
    <P>The Real IRA and its supporters know they have no alternative to offer but mindless violence. They know there can be no justification for the murder and wounding of their fellow Irish people. They defy the settled will of the people, North and South, who in referendums in 1998 <Col N="650" /> voted together for the first time since 1918. Defeated at the ballot box, they seek to bend the people to their will through the use of force. However, the Government will use every tool at its disposal to thwart their efforts. The bombers will not be the judges or arbiters of our future and they should be aware that all sides of the House are united in this view. The more they seek to bring the Agreement down, the more committed and determined we will be to see it implemented in full.</P>
    <P>The Agreement is the only way forward. It is an honourable and balanced accommodation between the differing political identities and aspirations on this island. As the Taoiseach said at the weekend, the principle of consent which lies at its heart is both a safeguard and an incentive. It ensures there can be no change in the constitutional status unless it is the wish of a majority of the people. However, it also leaves it open to all of us to seek to bring about change by agreement and by peaceful means. As democrats, we cannot tolerate anything else.</P>
    <P>The Agreement encompasses much more. It provides for institutions in which the people of this island, Nationalist and Unionist, can come together to build a better and more prosperous future and those institutions are working. The executive in Northern Ireland is uniting with a common purpose, people who just a few short years ago would not have been prepared to sit around the same table. Given the immense controversy that surrounded Strand Two of the talks, that meetings of the North/South ministerial council take place in a low-key manner is surely evidence of their success and of our immense progress.</P>
    <P>Yes, we have had, and continue to have, difficulties in implementing parts of the Agreement. It was always going to be so. However, we will continue to talk them through and we will work them out. As we recommit ourselves to the project, we should remember that the real purpose of the Agreement is the creation of a better future for all the people of this island, working together in partnership and peace.</P>
    <P>The Agreement says we must never forget those who have died or who have been injured and their families, and we never will. However, it rightly acknowledges that we can best honour them with a fresh start with a new beginning in which we firmly dedicate ourselves to the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust. It is in dedicating ourselves to this task that we will ensure there can never be another Omagh.</P>

      <P>As has been said on many occasions, the Omagh atrocity was the most out<Col N="651" /> rageous act of terrorism this country has witnessed in many a day. Speakers on all sides of the House, and those outside, have condemned the bombing and its perpetrators. It is incumbent on us at all times to add our voices to those who call for the bringing to justice of the perpetrators of that outrageous atrocity.</P>
      <P>Almost every Member of this House has been touched in some way by the sense of outrage. Two people from my constituency were innocently shopping in Omagh on that day and still bear the mental scars of the trauma they endured as a result of that visit. They were visiting friends whom they visited on many occasions, some of whom, unfortunately, are no longer with us. They built links with their friends in the Omagh region and I hope they will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Garda for its work. I also compliment the RUC for the co-operative effort in which it has engaged in pursuing the perpetrators. It will be difficult to track down these murderers. It is always very difficult to track down terrorists who have a way of protecting themselves and their gangs, and of eliminating anyone likely to provide information to the forces of law and order. However, it is incumbent on anyone with information to make it available to the police forces on both sides of the Border whether by using confidential telephone lines, approaching people they can trust or whatever. The perpetrators are sophisticated and we should not under estimate their capacity to subvert the rule of law.</P>
      <P>This bombing was another attempt to divide those who favour democracy over terrorism but the Good Friday Agreement will outlive many efforts to subvert it in this way. There are, and there will be, difficulties. It is unreasonable to expect there would not be difficulties, but I have no doubt the will of the people, North and South, expressed democratically will prevail and that these people who have no support will ultimately discover they are fighting a losing battle.</P>
      <P>We must express our concerns for the victims and do everything in our power to support them. This will be a long struggle for them and their families. We are talking about the struggle for justice and not revenge. It would be too easy for anger, hatred and revenge to overcome our anxiety to bring people to justice. Those responsible must be brought to justice but that can only happen with the full co-operation of all Members bringing our views to bear on those in a position to influence others and to fully and wholeheartedly support the Garda and the RUC in building a new, more effective and more democratic society which we all strive to uphold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No one could fail to have been moved by recent media coverage of the inquest into the Omagh bombing. I reject in the strongest possible terms, any suggestion that the Government has been remiss in pursuing those responsible for the heinous atrocity perpetrated against <Col N="652" /> innocent people in Omagh in August 1998. Every right thinking person alive that day was filled with revulsion by that cowardly act. Along with revulsion there was anger that anyone claiming to be Irish could commit such a deed. Neither the revulsion nor the anger has lessened and to them has been added a determination to leave no stone unturned until all those in any way responsible have been caught and tried. The Government introduced a number of amendments to the criminal justice legislation to enable the Garda to more effectively root out those people and uncover their lair. The Garda has not wanted for resources.</P>
      <P>As human beings our hearts went out to all those injured in Omagh, particularly to those whose loved ones will never return. We recognise that hardly a minute goes by without them being reminded of the horror of that afternoon. The process of coming to terms with the event is difficult, and it is made more difficult by the fact that the perpetrators are, as yet, free to live their lives. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will never shirk from the Government's duty to track down those responsible. All those in any way affected by the events of that afternoon need never have doubts on that score. The Government is 110% committed to the achievement of lasting peace on our island.</P>
      <P>We have made great strides in the peace process over a number of years but we have more to do. It is after all a process in which there will be many problems, but the attainment of lasting peace is worth all the effort. The end of violence in Northern Ireland means a great deal to people throughout this land and beyond, but it is felt acutely by the people of the Border areas like my own and of the entire province of Ulster who have suffered for decades as a result of the conflict. The construction of lasting peace can only come about through hard work, not by political point scoring.</P>
      <P>In the immediate aftermath of the bombing, the Government pledged to do its utmost to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice. In response to this atrocity the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, was passed by the Dáil in emergency session and that legislation was supported by all parties in this House. I am somewhat surprised at Fine Gael's confusion as expressed recently. On the one hand the Fine Gael spokesperson on Northern Ireland takes account of the excellent investigative work carried out by the RUC and the Garda Síochána, while his party leader states there is doubt as to whether the Govenments are using the full weight of the legislation passed in the wake of Omagh. Fine Gael's confusion regarding what is an extremely sensitive issue offers little comfort to anyone.</P>

      <P>During the course of the conflict of the past 30 years, the Omagh bombing of August 1998 was second only to the bombing of Dublin and Monaghan in May 1974 <Col N="653" /> in terms of loss of life. The Omagh bombing was a deplorable atrocity, which took 31 lives and seriously injured many more. Let there be no mistake, it was an attempt to destroy the peace process. I said at the time, and I repeat, that the small unrepresentative splinter group that carried out the bombing clearly do not hold themselves accountable to any community or political constituency. Their ill-conceived campaign is setting back the cause they claim to serve. We must spare no effort to press on with the peace process, thereby ensuring that such tragedies never recur.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the Omagh tragedy, I was present at the removal of the bodies of Avril Monaghan and her daughter Maura to their home in Clogher, County Tyrone. The next day I attended the funeral mass in St. MacCartan's chapel, Augher, with colleagues from both sides of the Border. The closely knit communities on the Monaghan-Tyrone border felt then, and still feel, the awful impact of the tragedy. The recent inquest has seen the bereaved, the injured and the witnesses having to relive the atrocity. It emphasised that those affected need, and should receive, our continuing support.</P>
      <P>This motion has been brought forward in the context of growing and very serious difficulties in the peace process. Those difficulties centre on the failure of the British Government to meet the need for the establishment of a real civil police service in the Six Counties to replace the RUC. It is not about decommissioning, the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party or the political credentials of Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, this motion is being used to make party politically motivated attacks on Sinn Féin. In proposing it, Deputy Bruton relied heavily on media reports alleging that the Government had applied pressure on the Garda not to pursue the Omagh investigation in a certain manner. These allegations have been dismissed out of hand by Government members in this House. I do not know the ultimate source of those allegations, but the heavy spin being put on them must be seen in the political context of the real difficulties now being experienced in the peace process. Deputy Bruton needs to analyse more deeply the type of reporting which he has given credence to here, and he must question whose interests they serve. This is the same type of grossly irresponsible reporting which in recent days has fuelled the fears surrounding the killing of Joseph O'Connor in Belfast and which has once again been used by opponents of Sinn Féin to urge our exclusion from the Executive. I note that the IRA last night denied responsibility for that death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to come into this Chamber to defend the position of Sinn Féin in the peace process. It is a matter of historic record. We have been absolutely central to the creation, maintenance and continuing development of the peace process. All along, we have confronted the realities of the conflict too often deliberately ignored by many in this Chamber. It is on the basis of reality, not fantasy or wishful thinking, that we <Col N="654" /> have been able to lead republicans successfully in this peace process.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the RUC does not have the support of the vast majority of Nationalist people in the Six Counties. It is and always has been a sectarian paramilitary force, an active participant in the conflict, responsible for many deaths. I cannot endorse this motion because I will not advocate co-operation with that force. Let the record show once again that we have called &ndash; I have made this call repeatedly &ndash; upon the group responsible for the Omagh bombing to disband. Our pursuit of a peaceful strategy has won the support of the vast majority of republican opinion.</P>
    <P>Against that reality and the centrality of Sinn Féin to this peace process, I view with alarm the efforts of the proponents of this motion who seek to present it as a further test we in Sinn Féin must pass. I totally reject that approach and recognise it as a pointed attempt to pillory myself and my party. On the one hand, the micro-grouping responsible for the dreadful atrocity in Omagh is still working to destroy the peace process and undermine the determined efforts of the Sinn Féin leadership. On the other hand, among those proposing this motion are those who can barely conceal their narrow party political motives as they attempt to denigrate Sinn Féin. I opposed the passage of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, and its renewal earlier this year. I maintain opposition to such repressive legislation and for that reason also I will not endorse this motion. It is important that Members of this House listen clearly to this: my sincere desire is to see justice and truth for all the victims of the conflict, including those of the Omagh bomb. The success of the peace process will be their lasting memorial.</P>

      <P>There is great anxiety regarding the continuing bomb scares, resulting in low morale <Col N="655" /> among traders in Omagh. It is upsetting that these bomb scares continue. There has been a huge loss of confidence in tourism, particularly in regard to visitors from the South. All of us have a role to play in encouraging the development of tourism in Northern Ireland, particularly in Omagh, which has suffered so much. Omagh is no longer considered attractive for inward investment and it will suffer for many years. The threat still posed by dissident republicans from the Border counties has added to the turmoil and huge grief which still exists in Omagh.</P>
      <P>There is a huge sense of frustration that two years on, the physical scars in the town are still plainly visible. There is a great need for investment and the British Government has a role to play, as does the Irish Government through cross-Border initiatives. It is not good enough that the physical scars, in terms of buildings and structures, are still there two years later. Assistance is also needed to recreate a positive image of the town to the outside world. The town of Omagh is synonymous with terrorism and the events of 15 August. The horror of Omagh has made it imperative that all sides live up to the principles up to which they signed in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>We must recognise there has been a drain on resources locally in terms of counselling for those who have suffered as a result of the bomb and for the wider community. While people may be quite sympathetic, cash and help is needed and this Government could play a role in this as well. This Government has an obligation to those who have provided a counselling service from the start. It would be a great source of encouragement for them if they were given recognition and support in this huge endeavour which will be needed for many years to come.</P>
      <P>We also need to recognise the role played by community groups and church groups in re-establishing and in building on the previously good community relations which existed in Omagh. It is important that this rebuilding takes place and that what was, prior to the Omagh bombing, a fantastic community relationship, is re-established. That has been put under pressure. That is where this Government could be more visible in terms of what it is doing in regard to many of those issues. Nobody will forget 15 August 1998. Omagh is synonymous with terrorism and the families have suffered since then. What is needed is action and real help where it will make a difference.</P>

      <P>I wholeheartedly and unreservedly support this motion as should every member of every party that signed up to the Good Friday Agreement. There is no room for any member of any one of those parties in this House or outside it to quibble with what is set out in this motion. I <Col N="656" /> regret that a quibble has been entered tonight. I note that since yesterday morning, the scurrilous sham green attacks on my party leader and on Deputy Hayes have ceased. These were attributed to an unnamed Government spokesperson. I conclude that somewhere in the back of the Fianna Fáil mind another bit of jingoism has been rooted out. That is progress.</P>
      <P>I agree with everything the Minister for Foreign Affairs said. I listened to him carefully. I could have said all that myself but I think I might have said it with a bit more conviction. The Minister said what he should say and what he is called upon to say. I did not detect in what he said or in his demeanour any sense of urgency or any burning wish to advance the investigation of this crime beyond the point we have now reached.</P>
      <P>It was left to Deputy Keaveney, for whom I have a great regard and respect, as I have for every other elected Member of this House, a backbencher on the Government benches to give us the first piece of information we have got during the course of this debate about how the Garda are applying the legislation we passed on an emergency basis two years ago. Why is it being left to a Government backbencher to give us that type of information? We still do not know whether it is true, as has been reported, that the Garda operation in Monaghan has been wound down.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Ó Caoláin and I concluded &ndash; I think other people who have listened to him and who will read his words will agree with me &ndash; that he has very carefully avoided asking anybody who has any information that might help in bringing the perpetrators of this crime to justice to come forward and to give that information to the Garda and the RUC. Deputy Ó Caoláin's only call on those people was to disband. I do not want those people to disband, I want to see them in jail. I do not want the Real IRA to disband, to go home and to get on with the rest of their lives as if none of this had ever happened. If Sinn Féin really subscribes to what it signed up to in the Good Friday Agreement, Deputy Ó Caoláin should not be in this House asking that group to disband, he should be calling on people &ndash; there are people who know things that would be useful in bringing the perpetrators of this crime to justice &ndash; and encouraging those people to give information to the Garda and the RUC, to the forces of law and order on this island which are there to protect people like those who were killed and maimed in Omagh. Any prevarication about that is doing nothing more than encouraging those people to believe that there is still a place for their kind of foul philosophy, murder and killing, in the political life of this island.</P>

      <P>It is surely time we went past that.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner in the time that has passed since that bombing, made an extraordinary and unprecedented statement, that in his belief maybe, possibly and even probably nobody would be brought to justice for this. That is an unprecedented statement for a Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to make. I know the constraints under which the Garda work. I was in the Minister's shoes for a period and I know how difficult it is to run a police force in the public gaze but when a Commissioner of the Garda Síochána makes an unprecedented statement like that, we are entitled, in return, to make an unprecedented request of him, that is, to come out and say in public why he came to that conclusion, what process brought him to that conclusion, so that we can know and do whatever may be required to make sure that fear on his part does not come true and that the perpetrators of these murders will be brought to justice.</P>

      <P>Of all the atrocities committed in a generation of violence, the atrocity at Omagh was the worst. It was the worst not only because of the number killed and because so many men and women, boys and girls, Protestant and Catholic were maimed and slaughtered but because the peace process had put a whole community off guard and had united it in its vulnerability. The atrocity at Omagh is also the worst atrocity because so far, the efforts of the security forces, North and South, to bring the perpetrators to justice have been ineffective. The commitments of the Taoiseach in this House &ldquo;to crush and dismantle any organisation that still engages in violence and to bring the perpetrators of Omagh to justice&rdquo; are beginning to ring quite hollow.</P>
      <P>When the people North and South voted for the Good Friday Agreement, they voted for peace, for a new democratic dispensation and for new institutions to allow the elected members of both communities to share in the governance of Northern Ireland. They also agreed to pragmatic and expedient arrangements to allow for the release of prisoners long before they had served their full sentences, despite the hurt this caused to many victims and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of this House and the House of Commons introduced measures dealing with the surrender of weapons. These made the forensic testing of such weapons illegal and consequently ensured the <i>de facto </i>closure of the bulk of outstanding cases involving guns. All this was done to heal the wounds of a fractured community and was fully justified on the basis that a historic line had been drawn on the day the Good Friday Agreement was signed and that those involved in atrocities before that date would be treated with leniency because of the absolute need to heal and reconcile. It was also clear, however, that those involved in terrorism after that historic date could <Col N="658" /> not expect such leniency and that the rule of law would apply to all once the new dispensation was in place. This is the nub of this debate. Will the law be fully applied to those who slaughtered the innocent in Omagh or are the Garda and the RUC receiving signals that what is pragmatic, expedient or politic is more important than the rule of law?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must assure us that this is not so. He must explain, if it is not so, why the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, is not being used against the Real IRA and why the Garda team investigating the Omagh bombing is alleged to have been wound down after three months in contrast with the team investigating the Veronica Guerin murder, which is largely intact after four years. Why does the Government think the Opposition, in asking these questions, is being sucked into a campaign of disinformation aimed at destabilising the peace process, as cited in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i> and ascribed to an anonymous Government spokesperson? I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform how would the conviction of the Omagh bombers possibly destabilise the peace process? I am frightened by ambiguity in these matters. The pragmatic, the expedient and the politic can quickly become the amoral and the immoral. We need the reassurance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the Government remains committed to bringing the Omagh bombers to justice.</P>

      <P>The Omagh bombing was the most wicked and deadly of all atrocities committed during the troubles in Northern Ireland. While this murderous act occurred in Omagh, it was a crime against the entire Irish people, an act of almost satanic evil.</P>
      <P>I come from neighbouring Donegal, where the people had total empathy with the people of Omagh in their dark hour of horror. What happened to them really happened to us as well. The roots of that friendship and respect between Donegal and Tyrone go back many generations and even partition did not succeed in fracturing it. The atrocity of 15 August 1998 stopped the heart of Donegal. That morning, more than 50 young children and their leaders left Buncrana on a bus for a day out in Omagh. That afternoon, five of them lay slaughtered in that street &ndash; James Barker, Oran Doherty and Shaun McLaughlin, all from Buncrana, with their young friend from Spain and his teacher &ndash; truly the slaughter of the innocents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the most tragic events I have attended during my time as a Member of this House were the funerals of these five young people in Buncrana. The funerals brought the entire nation together with Nationalists, Unionists, Catholics and Protestants united in our outrage and grief. <Col N="659" /> It is unbelievable that after two years, none of the perpetrators have been apprehended and brought to justice. We know the organisation guilty of the atrocity and its membership, and while the BBC has gone as far as naming the bombers, nobody has been charged.</P>
    <P>That organisation, the Real IRA, is free and active throughout the country. It is currently engaged in attracting and recruiting young people to its ranks, its fund-raising activities continue unabated and it is probably planning and preparing for further bombing missions and atrocities. This State has at its disposal, under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, one of the most powerful and draconian anti-terrorist Acts ever passed by the Oireachtas. Yet no one has been charged, tried or sentenced.</P>
    <P>The people of Omagh continue to suffer. During the recent inquests, they had to relive their entire nightmare. As I pass through Omagh every week, I see houses being rebuilt, businesses being re-opened and streets and pavements being reconstructed. However, the bereaved are still in deep mourning and the injured and maimed are silently suffering. Some lost limbs, others their sight and others are paralysed or disfigured. Their suffering continues and the perpetrators continue to enjoy their freedom. Until they are brought to justice, the wounds of Omagh will remain raw and running. Only when the guilty are brought to justice will their wounds begin to heal. Omagh, its victims and their suffering will never and should never be forgotten.</P>
    <P>I compliment Fine Gael and our spokesman, Deputy Brian Hayes, for tabling this motion this evening. I am glad it seems to have support from all sides of this House because that is as it should be.</P>

      <P>I too congratulate Deputy Brian Hayes on bringing this motion before the House. I thank all those who support it &ndash; I note that most of the House supports it. It is good to read of the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern's commitment to the final principles of the founder of his party Éamon de Valera. The Taoiseach seems to be finally taking his party back to the policy of realism in which Mr. de Valera was required to engage to deal with the subversives of this State. I also welcome the speech made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, which was most encouraging. Lemass and de Valera knew that the only policy which yields success with terrorist murderers is strong action. Unfortunately, both of these leaders had moved on from the leadership of the Taoiseach's party. Those who succeeded them played footsie with evil malcontents who were prepared to stain their hands with the blood of Irish brothers and sisters in the interest, it would seem, of personal bounty.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> Not one acre of land has been added to this State since the House approved the Treaty in 1922 between the Irish people and the people of the United Kingdom. It did not matter which rebel led the charge &ndash; not one of them was enough. Our State history has been stained and soiled over the past 78 years by the actions of those who look for justice through violence. These violent people deny those working towards the peace and calm of an environment of non-violence the chance to make progress towards removing injustice and discrimination and allow them at the same time to create a climate of reconciliation between all so that the agenda of the Nationalist people might be advanced.</P>
    <P>We must congratulate all those, be they from the North, South or Westminster, irrespective of their politics, who supported and made possible the movement which resulted in the Good Friday Agreement. Let no splinter group, loyalist or republican, be allowed to orchestrate and execute carnage of any kind. The appalling devastation that occurred in Omagh is a revulsion to all right-minded people, its function to shock and incite further retaliation. This action violates all that republicanism should stand for.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent news of Garda activity and inquiries and hope they are successful in bringing those who are responsible for this outrage to justice. It was suggested in the papers recently that the initial wave of determined Garda activity was scaled down within weeks and that all measures have not been taken by the gardaí to secure evidence which will lead to convictions. It was suggested the criminal investigation is stymied by political consideration. The Government must account for this. It must take and be seen to take all possible action to secure a conviction. Given the anguish of those who are left, I call on the Government to set aside its political agenda and act in the interests of all Ireland.</P>

      <P>As has been said, the bombing in Omagh was a significant and terrible atrocity. It was of special significance because it came after the vote by the people, North and South, who expressed their right to self-determination by voting decisively and overwhelmingly for the Good Friday Agreement. Whatever claim existed to <Col N="661" /> represent Irish aspirations for unity were wrested away, once and for all, from extreme Nationalists when the Irish people established the primacy of democracy over terror and violence in that vote.</P>
      <P>Like many other atrocities committed by other militant Nationalists over the years, the bombing of Omagh was an act of premeditated destruction of human lives. It was also an act of terrorism against the Irish people in a desperate attempt to destroy peace in Northern Ireland. It succeeded in destroying and maiming many people, mainly children and women. Although each death has devastated a family not just in Omagh and its outlying areas but in Buncrana, County Donegal, and Spain it failed in its objective to destroy the implacable determination of the people to pursue the path of peace and hope. If anything the bomb reinforced that determination.</P>
      <P>I was in Omagh last week meeting representatives of local women's groups. They were concerned about the problems that concern most women &ndash; drugs, crime, child care, their children's futures &ndash; and I was struck by the way they are getting on with life, working together to make life better for their community. Their resilience was reflected in the new buildings taking shape on the streets of Omagh to replace those that were lost but resilience should not be mistaken for acceptance. I have heard the view that people in Omagh have accepted as fact that no-one will be brought to justice for the bombing, that somehow the price of peace demands this case will not be closed. Commissioner Pat Bryne's comments that the people will probably never be caught are reasonable but nobody who has listened to the testimony given by the relatives of the Omagh victims could be satisfied with that conclusion, particularly when we look at the record.</P>
      <P>We should be encouraged in pursuing what is being proposed this evening rather than being discouraged. There has been a number of significant Garda operations against dissident Republicans. It is safe to assume that these successes were largely based on high grade intelligence. The success of the Garda in breaking up a dissident republican training camp in Stamullan, County Meath, and the seizure of an arms shipment in Croatia this summer illustrate the degree of penetration by the Garda into both the, Real IRA and the Continuity IRA. This success is welcome and encouraging and has, no doubt, saved lives but it raises the inevitable question: if the Garda have made progress in those instances are they making every effort and using every means to bring the Omagh bombers to justice? The use of accomplice evidence is one issue which has not been clearly answered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme highlighted a failure by both the Garda and RUC to make the progress we all desire towards convictions. Naturally, the media in its comment concentrated on the editorial approach but surely the issue is not <Col N="662" /> that the programme was made but that, in a sense, it had to be made because there is still an unresolved matter. It served a purpose in highlighting the difficulties, and the failure, in bringing the Omagh bombers to justice and it may have helped in assisting progress towards the goal of convictions. It is important to put that on the record. We, too, must lend our voice to pursue and persuade the Government to live up to all the promises made in the aftermath of this atrocity.</P>
    <P>At the time internment was being discussed and considered, certainly in the media, and was rightly rejected as an inappropriate response. Instead new, tough, draconian measures were introduced by the Government with a solemn undertaking by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The indications were that the killers would be caught and convicted. At the time a spokesperson for the Department was quoted in the newspapers as saying: &ldquo;The intelligence and evidence against these people is already there but there is no way convictions would have been secured under existing legislation. There is enough evidence against those responsible for this heinous crime to make strong cases against them under new legislation&rdquo;. Two years later, we have to judge that proposition and we must conclude that it did not deliver on the promise made to us by the Government. We recognised at the time that we were making difficult choices and that extraordinary events require extraordinary measures, ones that in normal circumstances would be anathema to us in terms of human and civil rights. We must weigh up the outcomes of decisions made in this House and the performance of the Garda and the RUC and determine the way forward in making the greatest possible effort to ensure that those who have killed, and if they are not apprehended may kill again, are convicted of the foul deeds of which they are guilty.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this very important motion and that we are accepting it. The Opposition and Government do not often agree on matters but this is one on which we are largely agreed. I hope it will send out a message from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like everyone else, I was reviled by what happened in Omagh a few years ago. It was probably the worst atrocity in Northern Ireland over the past 35 years. When we think of what has gone on there over that period that is saying something. I often wonder about the kind of inhuman individual who does something like that. Such people must have a mental problem. What the Minister said last night was apt: you may be beyond reason but you are not beyond the law. They are certainly beyond reason. Anyone with any spark of decency could not be involved in destroying innocent men, women, children and the unborn in such a callous fashion. I wonder how such people <Col N="663" /> live with themselves. When we consider what the relatives, the people in Omagh and those who have been maimed have to live with, in whatever cause the bombing was done it was not in the cause of nationalism.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt about the resolve of the Government and the Garda to bring the perpetrators to justice. It is often much later that we find out about the Herculean efforts of the Garda to bring various criminals to justice. When an investigation is ongoing it must be shrouded in secrecy. Quite often people might think nothing is happening and the Garda are not doing anything. Invariably we find out that is not the case, often as a result of television programmes going back over cases or through the media or someone writing a book. Time and again we have found out the marvellous work done. We do not know what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>I watched the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme with interest. While it showed much of what is known, most likely it did not show all that is known. I disagree with Deputy McManus when speaks about the lack of progress by the police forces on both sides of the Border. I have no doubt but that far more progress has been made than was shown but it could not be allowed into the public domain. Originally I had an open mind about the programme. I was mindful of what some of the relatives said and their fears that cases might be prejudiced as a result of it. However, it was handled very well and sensitively. If anything, it might encourage people to come forward and give vital evidence to the police forces in the North and South. I listened afterwards to some of the phone-in radio programmes, where people were suggesting that businessmen &ndash; I do not know whether they are guilty &ndash; who were shown on that programme should be blacked. Whether or not they should be, it is easy for people like me who live 150 miles from the Border to say that.</P>
    <P>We must remember that we are all in this together. We cannot leave it to the Government or the Garda to sort out. The entire public is involved in this. Unless we all stand together and isolate the men of violence, we will not solve this problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate. I had intended speaking last night, but I was attending a meeting of the EU Council of Ministers and I could not make it home in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will know, the Government agrees with this motion. This House was and remains united in its revulsion at the atrocity at Omagh. It was, and I am sure remains, determined to bring forward whatever measures may be necessary to protect innocent lives, and <Col N="664" /> democracy itself, from the nihilistic violence of groups such as the so-called Real IRA. This challenge faces us at the very moment when there is a very real prospect of lasting peace.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that advancing the peace process has been the greatest challenge facing Governments here in recent years. It is a task which requires judgment and sensitivity. There have been setbacks but, for all that, if even ten years ago someone had predicted the huge progress which has been made, they would have been met with widespread incredulity.</P>
    <P>Members on both sides of the House have played central roles in advancing that process and, generally, those in Government could rely broadly on the support of the Opposition parties. It was in that spirit of unity, arising from what is undoubtedly the shared view of this House in relation to Omagh, that the Government agreed to the terms of this motion. I very much regret, however, that the debate last night, from what I have read and heard of it, did not reflect the solemnity and gravity which should surely characterise any debate on the Omagh atrocity.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the main issue of substance, in so far as there was any issue of substance, raised by the Opposition, was the contention that the 1998 Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act has effectively been unused since its enactment. I will deal with that point in a moment, but first I will deal with certain other matters raised by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Despite my hopes that this debate would not become politicised and that the House would exhibit a dignified unity of purpose on Omagh and its aftermath, removed from the normal political rancour of which the public despairs, I realised that the omens were not good. Last Sunday, Deputy Hayes, in whose name this motion has been tabled, issued a press statement concerning newspaper allegations that the Government was interfering with the investigation by the Garda Síochána into the Omagh bomb for political purposes. Deputy Hayes' statement called on the Government to challenge these allegations immediately, saying that it would be entirely unacceptable that a criminal investigation could be hampered by political considerations, that unless the story was challenged by the Government, observers &ndash; whoever they might be &ndash; could, in effect, make the allegation that collusion has taken place between the institutions of this State on foot of the priorities of paramilitaries, and that if the allegations were let stand they would undermine credibility in our system of justice and would damage the Garda Síochána. Much the same was said last night, when Deputy Bruton, referring to the newspaper allegations, said this debate afforded me the opportunity to deal comprehensively with the allegations, and that the allegations must be put on the floor of the House so that they could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> I do not for a moment query the right of Deputies to ask questions on any matter or to seek to hold the Government to account, but with rights comes responsibility. Deputies surely have a responsibility, above all in dealing with a matter such as the atrocity at Omagh, to be aware of the consequences of what they say. It is simply disingenuous for the Deputies opposite to claim they merely asked some questions on a matter of public importance which had been raised in the media. It is one thing, however deplorable, for such allegations to be made in a newspaper; it is quite another for the matter to be raised by the main Opposition party's spokesperson on Northern Ireland, supported by the leader of that party. The reality is that the way in which the matter was raised by Deputy Hayes, with the allegation set out in detail in a press statement and accompanied by an apocalyptic analysis of the consequences should the allegation prove to be true, clearly threw the weight of the Opposition behind the credibility of what was alleged. I am aware that Deputy Hayes, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, accepted the Government's denial of the allegation, but that goes nowhere near compensating for the damage which has been done.</P>
    <P>The very suggestion that this Government would seek to interfere with the Garda investigation into the Omagh bomb is horrifying. Can the House imagine the effect that such an allegation could have on those who have lost loved ones in Omagh and who yearn for those responsible to be brought to justice? One might have thought that the very incredibility of the allegation would mean that the bereaved might not take it seriously, and might thereby escape the cruel suspicion that refuge was being given to those who committed the atrocity. However, might the bereaved not now think twice, given that the main Opposition party apparently judged the allegation sufficiently credible to justify the response it has sought from the Government? I will say nothing more about this despicable allegation except this: if the Opposition is not prepared to hold back from even the most outrageous slur on the Government, and in reality on the Garda Síochána, which would have to be party to what was alleged, will it at least have regard to the effect its indiscriminate broadsides might have on those outside this House?</P>
    <P>I will now turn to another matter raised last night by Deputy Bruton. According to the official record, Deputy Bruton said:</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there have been three arrests this morning in relation to Omagh but I have to point out that there have already been 58 arrests and subsequent releases in this investigation but still not a successful prosecution. The timing of the arrests on the day of this <Col N="666" /> debate is not a matter on which I will comment now.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Bruton had in mind when he made that comment, but it could, most regrettably, be taken as implying that the arrests were made by the Garda Síochána as a measure of political convenience for the Government in this debate, where we faced criticism that not enough was being done in bringing those responsible for the Omagh atrocity to justice. I am sure that, upon reflection, Deputy Bruton will acknowledge the interpretation to which his remark is surely open, and, from what I know of him, I am confident he will take the earliest available opportunity in the House to clarify his remarks.</P>
    <P>I very much regret having had to deal with those matters but, having done so, I will return to the main issue raised by the Opposition parties in this debate, which is whether the 1998 Act has been unused since its enactment. The 1998 Act was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing and, as has been noted in this debate, contained robust measures designed to enhance the capacity of the Garda Síochána to respond effectively to outrages such as that. In recognition of the potency of the key provisions of the Act, the Oireachtas provided that they would lapse on 30 June 2000 unless a resolution had been passed by both Houses continuing them in force for a period not exceeding 12 months. Provision was also made for further such resolutions. The Oireachtas also required me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to lay a report on the operation of the relevant sections of the Act before both Houses prior to any resolution continuing those sections in force.</P>
    <P>I laid the first such report before both Houses on 15 June 2000 and a resolution continuing the relevant provisions of the Act in force for a further 12 months was passed by both Houses on 20 June. My surprise can be imagined, therefore, when I read in the Official Report of last night's debate that Deputy Bruton, having lamented what he saw as the non-use of the Act, extraordinarily, and completely incorrectly, informed the House that the Act would lapse in two months' time and wondered whether, having been so little used, it would be renewed. Comment is superfluous, although I cannot help wondering whether the Opposition was altogether wise in resisting the attempt by the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, last night to explain the provisions of the Act. It might have done no harm.</P>
    <P>Let us get to the nub of the matter. It is unreal for the Opposition to imply, as clearly it is implying, that were it in office, the Omagh bombers would be behind bars. The intensive Garda investigation, in close co-operation with the RUC, would take exactly the same course no matter who was in office, and if the Opposition <Col N="667" /> cannot concede that to the Government, I readily concede it to the Opposition. The Garda Síochána and the RUC have done and continue to do immense work in their investigation into the Omagh bombing. They are utilising the 1998 Act. As my report on the Act revealed, at that stage 29 persons had been held in the extended detention provided for under the Act. The related provisions in the Act on the drawing of inferences from silence are relevant only to trials, so they do not have the same immediate impact as arrests and detentions, but they are nonetheless real. We should not overlook the reality that no one ever pretended that the post-Omagh legislation would, or should, allow people to be charged without evidence.</P>
    <P>There is on this island the real prospect of peace, an end to the violence that has destroyed and disfigured many lives. We cannot allow those who for their own ends are opposed to peace to succeed in denying the democratically expressed wish of the overwhelming majority of our people. The persons responsible for Omagh, in their opposition to the peace process, clearly have no regard for democracy. In the savagery of the bomb at Omagh they have demonstrated that they have no regard for human life. They represent nobody except themselves and are intent on imposing their will on the people of this island through violence. We in this House must never, and we will never, give in to such senseless violence. I did not hesitate in the aftermath of Omagh to bring proposals to this House which became the 1998 Act. I acknowledge readily the support I received on all sides. I understand the disappointment felt by everyone at the lack of progress in the Omagh investigation, although one person is currently before the courts in this jurisdiction on charges arising from the Omagh bombing. I hope this human frustration does not result in needless doubts being cast on the efficacy of the measures in the 1998 Act or in the commitment on the part of the authorities to enforce them.</P>
    <P>It is in the nature of ruthless terrorist acts such as Omagh that investigations can be lengthy and difficult. The Garda Commissioner earlier this year struck a note of realism when he spoke of the difficulties in the Omagh investigation. Be in no doubt that the Garda Síochána will never give up the hunt for the Omagh bombers. Let me state unequivocally without fear or favour in reply to queries which have been raised in relation to this matter, the Government is intent on pursuing those who were responsible for the Omagh bomb. Nobody, but nobody, should be in any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>In truth, despite the distractions which I have had to deal with, this House is united in the face of those responsible for the atrocity in Omagh who may even now be planning further violent <Col N="668" /> acts. Let that be the message which goes out from this House tonight, because that is something upon which we can all agree.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. I am taken aback by the severity of the Minister's remarks on this issue. My party put down the questions in good faith. It is part of the work of an active Opposition to question the Government when we are of the view that it has not performed properly. I view the Minister's comments as unhelpful. Certainly he has changed his attitude to the whole political process since attaining high office, and that is not helpful to politics.</P>
      <P>The Omagh bombing was the most savage and horrendous crime of murder that has taken place in Northern Ireland since the beginning of the troubles in 1969. It was the most savage and heinous crime because it was committed after the signing of the peace process when the public was off guard against terrorism and trying to live a life of commonality and ordinariness which we in the South have taken for granted for decades. The perpetrators of this heinous crime still walk free. It is inconceivable that there are people living in the State who do not know who planted the bomb.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Dukes, when he questioned the speech made by Deputy Ó Caoláin, who does not support the motion, who called for the disbandment of the Real IRA. I do not want to see the Real IRA disbanded, I want to see those responsible for the bomb arrested and spend the rest of their lives in prison where they deserve to be. Sinn Féin and Deputy Ó Caoláin could be more positive on that issue. They say they do not support the motion. This raises the question of whether they are interested in having those responsible for this horrendous crime put behind bars.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin and Sinn Féin as active partners in the peace process should encourage any person who may have information to give it to the security forces. If they do not wish to give it to the RUC, they surely have no objection to giving it to the Garda Síochána. Given that Sinn Féin is prepared to sit in this Parliament, its members must respect and accept the law enforcement agency, namely, the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the SDLP dinner in Dublin last Saturday. The major issue pertaining to Northern Ireland was the full implementation of the Patten <Col N="669" /> report on policing. The implementation of that report is fundamental to the future development of the peace process. Seamus Mallon said it is necessary that the Patten report is implemented in full. The progress of the peace process in Northern Ireland is essential if all Nationalists are to feel free and confident to join an independent and fair policing service. This is more important and fundamental than keeping the Northern Ireland Executive in place. Following from this, it is fundamental that the parties who support and have given specific commitments to the peace process should play an active role. Sinn Féin could play a pivotal role if it was to request the Provisional IRA, as a matter of urgency, to allow future inspections of its arms dumps and encourage the start of decommissioning. I have no doubt if Sinn Féin played this role, the Unionists would come on board and the Patten report which is fundamental to the peace process would be implemented in full. While all parties try to get their side of the Agreement implemented and are not willing to push and take the risk for peace, we will have the difficulties that are being experienced in the whole peace process.</P>
    <P>The reality is that if Mr. John de Chastelain is requested to make a report on the progression of taking arms out of use, he would not be able to give a favourable report and the Northern Ireland Executive would fall. I support the motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Hayes. Fine Gael, as our history shows, is as responsible as ever about the future of Northern Ireland. We would not do or say anything to put the peace process in jeopardy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Hayes and my party for tabling this motion. There are certain defining moments in our history. With the drugs issue it was, regrettably, the Veronica Guerin murder. The Omagh bombing was another such moment. Most people have focused on that tragedy. This motion was tabled for debate two years after the Omagh bombing and before the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme was broadcast.</P>
      <P>It is only right that the main Opposition party should table this motion. We are reflecting the viewpoint of most of the population who are most distressed that although there have been arrests, there have been no prosecutions following this tragedy. With regard to the Offences Against the State Act, when the Oireachtas returned in September 1998 to pass that emergency legislation the Taoiseach made it clear that it would crush and dismantle illegal organisations such as the Real IRA. It is understandable, therefore, that there is so much disappointment and unease that no prosecutions have followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is timely. Everything possible should be done to initiate prosecutions. After the Veronica Guerin murder the previous Govern<Col N="670" /> ment introduced a raft of legislation which tackled the drug barons. It is time we took on organisations such as the Real IRA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues on both sides of the House who contributed to this debate. No matter what was said last night or tonight, nothing can undo the pain and suffering of the victims of the Omagh bombing. Nothing in our deliberations will lessen their burden. The one thing that came from the inquest in Omagh was that the victims want justice done. They want to ensure that those who slaughtered 29 people and two unborn children two years ago and inflicted injuries on almost 300 others are brought to justice.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful that, in the context of the unanimous support in the House for this motion, a Minister of the Government came to the House to conduct political point scoring. It is an affront to the victims of Omagh that a Minister would entertain himself with such a speech. It does not do him justice and he should reflect on it. I will give him the opportunity between now and 8.30 p.m. to apologise not just to the victims of Omagh but to the people of this country for an outrageous speech on a motion which was unanimously supported in the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's attendance tonight. He did not see fit to reschedule his diary and come to the debate last night to deal with the worst criminal atrocity in the past 30 years. He arrived rather late in the day to throw mud at the Opposition. None of it will stick because people have genuine questions to ask and Members of the Opposition will apologise to nobody for asking them.</P>
      <P>There was not one word in the Minister's speech about Sinn Féin and the IRA. What comfort is that to the members of An Garda Síochána or to the memory of Detective Gerry McCabe who was murdered by the IRA? Their political apologists in the Republican movement in Limerick brought untold intimidation to bear on witnesses in the trial. What did the Minister say about Deputy Ó Caoláin and the equivocation we heard? Not a word.</P>
      <P>He used the speech to attack the leader of my party and myself because we had the temerity to ask questions about Omagh. We had the temerity to ask the Government fundamental questions about the legislation which was unanimously supported by the House in 1998. There was not a word about Deputy Ó Caoláin and his equivocation or about Sinn Féin. The Minister needs to cop himself on. He needs to realise that the people of this country have genuine questions which Members on this side of the House will continue to ask until those who were responsible for the worst single atrocity in the 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland are brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> I will say no more about one of the worst, mean spirited speeches by a Minister. The speech by Deputy Ó Caoláin was most unhelpful. I believe Sinn Féin and the IRA are committed to the peace process. I accept their <i>bona fides</i> on that issue. They want the peace process to succeed. An integral part of the Hume-Adams talks when they were initiated by John Hume over ten years ago was that one day, North and South, a new self determination would be created on this island. That self determination was established in May 1998. For my generation self determination is the Good Friday Agreement and we will have it rigorously enforced.</P>
    <P>Every criminal act since May 1998 is not just an attack on the Good Friday Agreement, the elected Members of this House and the new dispensation that has been established in Northern Ireland but also on the mainstream Republican movement which supports the Good Friday Agreement. It is not acceptable for Sinn Féin to say one day that it condemns the Omagh bombers and to call the next day for the disbandment of the Real IRA. As Deputy Dukes correctly pointed out, the victims of the Omagh bombing and those who care most for those who were murdered two years ago want justice to be done. They want the people responsible for those killings to be put behind bars. They do not want the disbandment of the Real IRA, although it is something they would support.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin equivocated in his speech because he could not support the RUC and An Garda Síochána. That was compounded by the Minister who refused to support the Garda given the speech made by Deputy Ó Caoláin. Instead he attacked us. The people who watched the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme want one thing, those responsible for the Omagh bombing to be brought to justice. They are horrified that a group of people can walk freely about our Republic having killed people in Omagh only two years ago.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier tonight with a victim of the Omagh bombing. That person asked me to ask one question at the end of this debate &ndash; why is it that the 32 County Sovereignty Movement is entitled to have bank accounts in this city and other front organisations and apologists for that organisation are entitled to raise money and continue their criminal acts? As I said last night, 26 criminal acts have been committed by the Real IRA since the Omagh bombing. It is not good enough for the Government to send its patsy to the debate tonight to attack the Opposition. The people of this country who support the Good Friday Agreement want answers to their questions and the Minister did not have the guts to give the answers tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the issue of the welfare of disturbed children.</P>
      <P>On Monday this week, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly in the High Court warned that he may shortly have to take unprecedented and dramatic action to secure the welfare of disturbed children because the juvenile criminal justice system has been reduced to a farce. In desperation the judge asked, &ldquo;How much longer will this go on? When will the situation come to an end?&rdquo; Today the judge ordered the Ministers for Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to find a secure place for a girl who is on the run from a therapeutic unit for the second time. Will the Minister of State outline her response to the court's demands? Will a secure place be provided and, if so, why does it take a High Court order to have this child taken care of? Why would the Minister not respond to the calls from me and other Deputies for action for disturbed children? Are the representatives of the people not listened to? Why does it take a threat of contempt of the High Court for the Government to respond?</P>
      <P>The 17 year old girl at the centre of this case has profound needs. She did not have a chance in life. She was sexually abused at seven years of age and was raped at the age of 11. Most children who were sexually abused suffer from a range of mental health problems. They often inflict self-harm either directly or through eating disorders and drug abuse. In the case before the court today, the child tried to take her life on two occasions. She has also abused alcohol and drugs. At the end of August, she was removed from an adult psychiatric hospital, which was totally unsuitable and where she had been held down and sedated, to a purpose-built therapeutic unit. Her escape from the unit last Saturday was the second such escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate whether she has been found. The court was informed that the unit cannot take her back, even if she is found, because of a shortage of staff. How can the Minister of State justify this? This House deserves a full explanation. It is a disgrace. The staff believe it is not a safe environment. Mr. Justice Kelly did not send her back to the adult psychiatric unit which is totally unsuitable for children, and rightly so. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has reported repeatedly that such institutions are totally unsuitable for children, yet action on this issue by the Minister for Health and Children has been at best minimal and at worst a disgrace. It is also a disgrace that if he <Col N="673" /> had to consider Mountjoy Prison as an option he could not do so because of the easy access to drugs in that State institution. In my view, a prison should not be an option to be considered for a child in such distress.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State outline the facts relating to the disappearance last Friday of two teenage boys, carrying the keys of the institution, from Oberstown Boys' Centre, Lusk, County Dublin? How did they obtain the keys of the centre? It would be comical, if it were not so serious, that the staff were locked into the centre and could only watch the boys through the window making their escape.</P>
    <P>I understand that a 16 year old girl was reported missing from the care centre on 10 October and a 14 year old boy went missing from another juvenile detention centre on 14 October. Will the Minister of State give a full report to this House this evening on these disappearances?</P>
    <P>In court on Monday, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly asked the barrister for the State whether anyone in power takes this matter seriously. I now ask the same question. Does anyone in power take this matter seriously? In relation to the case on Monday, the failure of the system was evident in the case of the out of control boy I mentioned who is described as a danger to himself and others. The District Court, despite directing the boy to detention for two years in a secure centre, had to release him on bail because there was no secure place available. Last April, the boy was ordered to be detained in Oberstown Boys' Centre but there was no place available. In July he was ordered to be sent to Trinity House but, again, there was no place available. He was then moved around several Garda stations until he was ultimately freed on bail. He was back in court on 11 September, was directed to Oberstown Boys' Centre but again there was no place available. I ask the Minister of State for a full reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for giving me an opportunity to place the state of our children in context and to say that most children lead very happy and safe lives. Unfortunately, some do not and it is incumbent on the State to assist and, where necessary, intervene. Approximately 4,000 children are in the care of the State. Of these, 80% are being cared for in foster homes. I accept that a child's family is the best place for that child. However, where that cannot happen, another family is the ideal choice. The remaining children are cared for in various forms of residential facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small number of children cannot be cared for in the more general residential settings and these are the children we are addressing tonight. These children have very particular needs, which require a wide range of responses. There is no doubt they are among our most vulnerable citi- <Col N="674" /> zens and they are and must be a major concern to us all.</P>
    <P>I would like to use this short time to outline our objectives for the care of these children and to explain a number of points in relation to the particular case which was raised today. As things stand at present, difficulties arise in securing specialist placing for individual children. It is the case that it may not be possible to place a child in a unit of first choice. However, when the extra 110 high support and special care places and the extra 30 places for offending children are built, I am confident this difficulty will be addressed.</P>
    <P>We are working to completely change the ways in which the State implements both preventative strategies and provides supports responsive to the individual needs of children. This involves changing legislation, changing training, providing major increases in resources and altering radically the culture of administration by ensuring proper co-ordination.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill proposes to change the fundamental legal basis upon which the State addresses the needs of children in difficulty. The Bill will move us away from a situation of limited options to one where there is a range of options available. At its core is a complete change to how cases are addressed once they come to the notice of the State. Family welfare conferences will ensure that all agencies involved in the welfare of the child will be involved. The funding has been provided to introduce this service in every health board.</P>
    <P>Over the last three years, we have provided an extra £64 million for child care services and have allocated funding for a wide range of building projects amounting to £122 million. Unfortunately, a number of individual projects have encountered delays. For example, a facility in Clare, which would provide a house for six children, has been delayed by a planning appeal. Deputies will be aware that there are difficulties in finding professional staff in most areas at present, but there are particular difficulties in relation to residential care.</P>
    <P>I want to stress again that we are doing all we can to overcome these and other difficulties. The National Children's Strategy will address co-ordination issues and set a wider context for a range of preventative and early intervention measures.</P>
    <P>The case before Mr. Justice Peter Kelly today is an extremely sad and sensitive one. When this case first came before the High Court in May, my Department gave a clear commitment to the health board responsible for the care of this child that any funding required would be made available to provide a suitable arrangement for her. A suitable house was subsequently converted at a cost of roughly £250,000. In addition, other funding for eight dedicated staff has been provided to care for this child. Counselling, therapy and education services were also provided. Every<Col N="675" /> thing the health board asked for in this case has been provided.</P>
    <P>While attending a hospital appointment the child absconded, but as soon as she is found the health board has confirmed that, as an immediate measure, she will be cared for in her specially adapted unit. However, there are serious staffing issues in the unit in question and my Department is doing everything possible, in conjunction with the health board to ensure these are resolved. Evidence was given in court today that psychiatric nurses in the hospital in which she was previously placed have refused to accept the child again and have threatened industrial action. Despite these difficulties, the board and the Department are fully committed to continue to provide for her care even though it will be necessary to find alternative staffing arrangements to allow this to be done.</P>

      <P>The training and education of young farmers is an important element in the future of rural Ireland. Farmers play a major role in the quality of our environment and food and in the economy of small towns and villages. They will shape our countryside and contribute significantly to the quality of life in rural Ireland in coming years. We rely to a great extent on the farming community to protect the quality of our water supply and to manage waterways, hedgerows and wildlife. The recent Government White Paper on Rural Development endorses the need for the education and training of young farmers and stresses its importance.</P>
      <P>It was with shock and dismay that we read in newspaper reports in County Westmeath that the Kennedy report commissioned by Teagasc recommended the closure of the Franciscan College of Agriculture at Multyfarnham, County Westmeath. The college has educated young farmers since 1957 and a new modern college was built in 1982. There has been huge capital and personnel investment by the Franciscans over the years in this facility and this has been complemented by a dedicated staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many thousands of young people have graduated from Multyfarnham agricultural college and they are to be found in every walk of life. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, is a proud graduate and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, taught there. The college provided an education not only in agricultural skills and techniques and animal husbandry but, most importantly, students were educated for life. Past <Col N="676" /> students proudly acknowledge the effect the college had on them and the successes in their lives.</P>
    <P>The college provides courses in horticulture, IT training and a diploma in agriculture in association with Athlone Institute of Technology. This is in addition to its basic agricultural courses. Student numbers fell in 1997 following the downturn in agriculture as a result of the BSE crisis. This phenomenon affected all sectors of agricultural life. There was a 25% increase in student intake this year over last year. The college and its staff are widely recognised for their excellence and students are enrolled from 20 counties. The student-teacher ratio is within Teagasc guidelines and management and staff are examining possibilities for further diversification and expansion.</P>
    <P>The report indicated that if the college were to close a similar service would have to be provided at another college at huge cost to the taxpayer. Does that make sense? Many areas of diversification are being examined. One retired teacher, Séan T. Kelly, carried out a great deal of research into the possibility of the college becoming a base for the Open University in Ireland. With its central location and varied facilities this could be an ideal site for such an educational establishment.</P>
    <P>Another possible area of diversification is to link the college to a similar facility in Enniskillen. This would do a great deal for cross-Border co-operation. I call on the Minister of State to stress to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development the importance of training for young farmers and the huge role this college plays in educating young farmers in the midlands. Will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development correspond with Teagasc to ensure funding is provided to secure the future of the Franciscan College of Agriculture at Multyfarnham?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time. As a strong proponent of rural development I have always argued that to keep farmers in the countryside and to avoid a rural wipe out, they should be equipped with the necessary skills to enable them to live on their farms and/or to obtain an ancillary income to supplement their farm incomes. This is especially true of those predominantly engaged in dry stock farming, particularly in the midlands. I called for a greater mix of courses involving the trades to be incorporated into the courses on offer in agricultural colleges to facilitate the opportunities in part-time farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff and management at Multyfarnham college were eager to embrace such innovative changes. Such colleges should be rural enterprise colleges with agriculture as one of the many subjects students could take. Multyfarnham agricultural college should not be closed. It should be extended as a rural enterprise centre in the field of agriculture and incorporate the Open Univer<Col N="677" /> sity concept to which my colleague, Deputy McGrath referred.</P>
    <P>In page 35 of the report commissioned by Teagasc on the future numbers and status of agricultural colleges Professor Kennedy of the ESRI coldly pronounced: &ldquo;Multyfarnham should cease providing agricultural training&rdquo;. This report sent shock waves and tremors of disbelief through the entire agricultural community in Westmeath and the midlands and shook the staff and the Franciscan community to the core.</P>
    <P>The community has provided agricultural training in this college since 1957 and in 1982 a new purpose-built college was provided on site. A huge investment was made in 1990 to modernise its farming structures. Ireland is supposed to be in the midst of an economic boom and many sectors of the economy are unable to keep pace with demand. It seems strange that the agricultural industry, which needs all the assistance and encouragement it can get, is subjected to this report. The report, if implemented, would be the very antithesis of rural regeneration and preservation and indicate that many of the utterances to date from a variety of sources including Ministers are nothing more than bluff, blather and bluster.</P>
    <P>I, along with Deputy McGrath, will lead a crusade of the people of Westmeath and the midlands against any proposed attempts to downgrade or close Multyfarnham agricultural college. I am prepared to communicate those views to each member of Teagasc and to the Minister. The college will not be closed but a commitment must be given to provide necessary funding. Closure could result from job cuts and a starvation of funding and I worry that that is the real agenda in this Teagasc based report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his Ministers of State. As is evident from the trends in employment, increasingly the farmers of today and tomorrow are farming on a part-time basis. It is fundamental that they possess the skills needed to pursue a career in modern farming and the skills demanded to secure an off-farm part-time job. The opportunities for securing off-farm employment have never been better.</P>
      <P>With virtually full employment in the economy and accordingly the increasing scarcity of qualified persons, employers have not been slow to recognise the potential benefits of bringing on board people from the farming sector. Companies are putting forward flexible working arrangements to take account of daily farming tasks. Both the European Commission and the Government have recognised the rapid changes taking place in agriculture, farming and in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> The Government recognises, in particular, that the well being of farm families is fundamental to the future of our primary industry. Such well being is as much related to income and income related situations for women and men in rural areas. In the White Paper on Rural Development, published last year elements of the strategy for agriculture will include the following: targeting schemes of aid for on-farm investment in favour of small and low income farm families; continuation of the early retirement and young farmer installation aid schemes; identification and promotion of farm-based diversification and alternative enterprises; and the provision of incentives for the modernisation of capital and stock investments.</P>
    <P>As set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government is fully committed to the development of a core of full time farms, which deliver a viable return to both capital and labour. This commitment is reflected in the very substantial supports currently paid, which will rise further as the gains from Agenda 2000 are felt. At the same time, our growing economy offers people in farm families attractive off-farm job opportunities and this provides an additional route to household viability for many families on smaller farms. The needs of these farm families will also be appropriately addressed by measures such as the new rural viability service of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>Clearly, a high quality focused education and skills learning strategy is fundamental to maintaining current progress and achieving progress in the future. Teagasc is the main provider of vocational education and training for young people who take up careers in agriculture. The Teagasc training programme for new entrants to farming is targeted at young people embarking on careers in agriculture, horticulture and other rural farming and rural businesses. Special provision is made for women in farming and comprehensive training is also provided in rural enterprise development.</P>
    <P>The Teagasc certificate in farming has been generally considered to be the minimum training which a person requires for a successful career in farming, whether full time or part-time. Since its initiation in 1983, more than 11,000 young people have completed the programme and of these 72% are in full time farming and a further 20% are in part-time farming. Teagasc also provides a range of diploma courses for new entrants, the most widely sought of which is the diploma in agriculture-dairying.</P>
    <P>In rural development training, Teagasc has concentrated largely on training for alternative income generating activity. These courses cover a variety of subjects and some courses lead to certification. Subjects include small scale food production and rural tourism.</P>
    <P>As with all public programmes, it is important to take stock of the agricultural training pro<Col N="679" /> gramme from time to time to assess its relevance in the light of changing social and economic circumstances. At the end of last year, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, set up a task force to conduct a review of the current agricultural and education training provision. The task force made several important recommendations, most of which Teagasc is now in the course of implementing.</P>
    <P>One of the main recommendations concerned the need to integrate agricultural education into the mainstream educational system through national certification by the national awarding bodies. I congratulate Teagasc for moving so quickly to implement this recommendation. The task force also highlighted the need to provide first class facilities for agricultural students and I am pleased that is being done and that appropriate funding is being provided. The sum of £2 million has been provided in the current year, the first instalment of a planned £10 million programme over the next five years.</P>
    <P>In the context of rural development, under the Leader II 1994-1999 programme, in excess of £11 million has been expended by the 34 local action groups on training initiatives for people in rural areas, encompassing a broad range of skills with particular emphasis on the provision of information and communication technology. Having regard to the emphasis on innovative activity under Leader, training courses have also been provided for the development and expansion of alternative enterprises. Under the new Leader arrangements, which are expected to come on stream early next year, it is anticipated that the programmes will include provision for the training of rural dwellers.</P>
    <P>I recognise the specific role of the third level colleges and institutions in progressing the development and sustainability of our rural economy for the future. I refer in particular to the excellent courses provided by the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute and the universities. The quality of the course material provided is innovative and is equipping an expanding number of people with the skills for promoting and developing rural communities for the future. It goes without saying that education of all rural dwellers and, in particular, our young people who are entering farming is a key aim of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>I will communicate to the Minister the specific case in Westmeath raised by Deputy Penrose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. Some months ago an advertisement appeared in the national media inviting submissions to a review <Col N="680" /> of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme. This review was timely and I am anxiously awaiting its deliberations. I am also anxiously awaiting word about when and what exactly the Government intends to do to address the clear anomalies which exist in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme.</P>
      <P>In my experience, one group has a clear case for inclusion in the guidelines for the scheme. This group comprises the 7,000 post-polio victims currently living in the State. Thankfully, we have turned the corner on polio and I hope the existing victims will mark the end of polio in Ireland. However, the fact that there are no new cases of polio does not mean that there are no associated problems that need to be addressed as far as post-polio victims are concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand that of the 7,000 polio victims, there are upwards of 5,000 who have or are developing post-polio syndrome. The effect of this syndrome is devastating for some people and, in some cases, may result in severe disability. There is an onus on the State to ensure that these victims are given every support possible &ndash; there is no reason this should not happen given our financial resources &ndash; to ensure that they have as optimal a quality of life as possible.</P>
      <P>To this end, it is crucial that the submissions made to the review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme on behalf of post-polio victims are considered favourably and that a decision is made to award them the normal concessions currently available to disabled drivers as soon as possible. As it stands, the criteria for the disabled drivers' scheme are strict and they fail to recognise a number of complex disabilities which are now manifesting themselves in post-polio victims.</P>
      <P>As it stands, of our population of post-polio victims, the vast majority of them have managed to access employment and hold onto their employment after receiving treatment for their initial polio condition. However, the problems arising for post-polio syndrome sufferers, of which, as I stated, there are 5,000, pose new risks to their continued ability to participate in the workforce. Part of the doubt which hangs over their future participation in work concerns mobility, particularly with regard to travelling to and from work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many of the complex disabilities which post-polio victims manifest do not match the criteria for qualification for the disabled drivers' scheme, most of these people require hand-controlled mechanisms in their cars if they are to drive at all. Given that the majority of post-polio sufferers have contributed to the building of this economy by their participation in employment, their needs should not be ignored. The case for awarding this concession to these people is particularly strong not just because they have contrib<Col N="681" /> uted to the social insurance fund throughout their lives, but also because it involves a very small but deserving group.</P>
    <P>Access to a car offers huge enhancement to the quality of life for post-polio victims. On a practical basis, a car offers them the most efficient and safest mode of transport currently available. In addition, it ensures that they have access to employment opportunities on a competitive basis with other more able bodied employees. On a social basis, access to a car ensures that post-polio sufferers have the independence they deserve to lead a full life.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the submissions received by the Department of the Environment and Local Government from representatives of post-polio sufferers are considered favourably and that assistance is delivered to them as a matter of urgency. I also ask the Minister to assure the House that this group will no longer be ignored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme was established in 1968 when section 43 of the Finance Act of that year introduced an exemption from road tax for vehicles adapted or constructed for and used by disabled persons who, in the main, would have been confined to wheelchairs. The scheme was later extended to allow for relief from VAT and excise duty &ndash; motor excise duty was replaced by vehicle registration tax with effect from 1 January 1993 &ndash; on the acquisition of a vehicle and from excise on the petrol used. Medical certification was issued by the disabled person's doctor and required that the person be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his legs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The limited medical criteria applying under the scheme were considered to be excessively restrictive and, in addition, the piecemeal fashion in which the scheme developed gave rise to a number of anomalies and abuses. Therefore, a framework for a new consolidated scheme of reliefs was provided under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989. The regulations made under that Act set out criteria for eligibility for the reliefs as well as specifying their scope and the various procedures to be complied with to qualify for benefit. The resultant Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, came into operation on 21 December 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions set out in the 1989 scheme was carried out in 1993 and resulted in the adoption of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. Six different types of disability are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. Essentially, those without the use of limbs, as distinct from those who are just weak in the limbs, will qualify. These regulations were drawn up follow<Col N="682" /> ing wide-ranging consultation with the Departments of Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, Opposition spokespersons for finance and organisations dealing with the disabled.</P>
    <P>The principal issue of concern expressed in connection with the reliefs was, and still is, in relation to their scope. Arguably, the pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its substantial benefit in terms of the tax relief extended. The qualifying disability criteria set out in the regulations relate essentially to persons who have severe and permanent physical mobility problems.</P>
    <P>While the number of potential beneficiaries is unclear, up to 350,000 persons in Ireland could be regarded as disabled to some degree. Not all of them would or could use any widened scheme, but the substantial tax benefits make for considerable interest in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The issue of the medical criteria for qualification was looked at in considerable detail in 1993/94, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to other medical categories. The review recommended that the existing specific medical criteria should remain broadly unchanged.</P>
    <P>The current medical criteria are designed so that people who qualify for the scheme do so irrespective of the original cause of their disability, and this is considered to provide for equitable treatment of those with severe mobility difficulties. As the House is aware, this scheme is currently under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition to representatives from that Department, the group has representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children, and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance is on record as saying in this House, he appreciates the difficulties which people who suffer from some disability face in coping with every day life. There are very many people with various forms of disability who would consider themselves as having a genuine case for tax relief. Given the level of benefits available under the scheme, the cost is quite considerable and extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with some dilemmas. The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 5,400. The cost of the reliefs, excluding the annual road tax costs, in 1999 was approximately £18 million, compared to £4 million in 1994. The cost of the scheme, again excluding the annual road tax costs, is estimated at £22 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> The average benefit per person per year is approximately £4,000 on the basis that more than 90% claim in respect of the purchase of a car every two years. The cost per beneficiary is thus very high in that benefits apply for life from the date of admission. The scheme is not means tested. Groups who benefit under the scheme are resistant to the notion of any &ldquo;tinkering&rdquo; with it because they believe it would not be possible to extend the benefits to other classes of disability without incurring prohibitive additional costs which, they fear, would ultimately result in a lessening of benefits generally. In this regard, representatives of the Disabled Drivers' Association advised the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, at a meeting on 3 July 1998, that they were &ldquo;strongly opposed to any tinkering with the regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental review group is trying to resolve the very complex issues involved. The group has met on several occasions. Listening meetings were held over a three day period in early May 2000 and over a two and a half day period in September 2000 with organisations and individuals who indicated a desire to make oral submissions to the review group. An advertisement was placed in the press on 11 May 2000 seeking written submissions from interested parties. I am sure the House will be interested in this information plus the fact that over 250 written submissions were received from individuals and groups. The group is considering all the points that were raised by such interested parties.</P>
    <P>As the review is ongoing, it would be imprudent of the Minister for Finance to consider any amendments to the scheme until such time as the review is completed and its content is given due consideration.</P>

      <P>This issue is of great concern to many people in the Killarney region, in addition to those both here and abroad who are proud of the national park at Killarney. It is not just a park of national importance but is also a UN biosphere reserve of international renown. The State must bear responsibility for, and exercise due care and protection of, such a valuable reserve. That strong concern about such a national reserve has prompted me to raise the matter of works that were carried out at the park and which are reportedly not in keeping with the protection that should be afforded to the park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July this year, large construction works were carried out in Killarney National Park, consisting of a dam on the Folly Stream to direct the stream through the Reen wet woodland, the construction of an almost 7-acre wetland in the bog field in Reen, and the construction of three lagoons in <Col N="684" /> the Muckross estate. These works were carried out by Kerry County Council in conjunction with Dúchas. I am aware of the county council's strong record of environmental protection and conservation, and it normally exercises its duties with care and caution. After all, the protection and conservation of such a valuable reserve is a major responsibility and demands additional duties and attention. County Kerry is the envy of many people because it contains such a major reserve of national importance.</P>
    <P>Dúchas is the heritage service charged with guarding national parks and protecting wildlife. As I understand it, a wetland is a natural method of treating waste water. I acknowledge that it has some value in specific locations, but not &ndash; as the Minister herself informed me in a written reply &ndash; as an addition to a major sewerage treatment system. The Killarney plant has a good record in treating effluent. The Minister has said the works were constructed to improve the quality of treated water, but can she say what research has been carried out on such a provision? Does the Minister realise that such a system might only reduce the phosphate discharge by as little as 50%? </P>
    <P>The Minister has also stated that the wetland will also act as a safety buffer if, for any reason, the treatment plant does not work properly. If that happens, however, the wetland will merely act as a cess-pit and not as a barrier in treating effluent. If it was so important to reduce further the level of effluent going into the lake, why not just improve or add on to the existing facilities with a more reliable scientific approach, such as activated carbon or even straw? It is wrong to provide such a large acreage of wetland in such an environmentally sensitive area. The Minister, who is the guardian and protector of our natural heritage, must account fully for what has happened in Killarney National Park.</P>
    <P>The Lough Leane working group was set up to examine all discharges into the lake, but was it consulted about these works? The works are said to have been provided to reduce the amount of nutrients going into the lake. The reserve is a candidate for the status of special area of conservation. The Minister has informed me that Dúchas was consulted about the works and carried out an assessment. An ecologist within Dúchas was satisfied that the project would have a positive impact and no significant adverse effects. Will the Minister tell me who consulted Dúchas and was a report on the proposed works produced by this ecologist, including a scientific assessment of the works? What other alternatives were assessed? </P>
    <P>Planning permission was never sought for the works, but it should have been. I acknowledge that when the matter was raised with Kerry County Council the works were suspended. The county council has now requested planning per<Col N="685" /> mission for the works. The fact remains, however, that these works were carried out with no consideration of the environmentally sensitive nature of the area. I hope the Minister will be able to answer the questions I have raised, which are in response to her written reply yesterday. She must outline what protection should be afforded to a candidate for special area of conservation status. Dúchas is fully aware of its obligations to protect this nature reserve of international importance, but is the State capable of protecting such an area?</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera): A multi-agency committee involving Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and Kerry County Council among others has been seeking methods of reducing the amount of nutrients discharged into the lakes of Killarney. The measures undertaken in Killarney National Park at Reen and Muckcross were carried out in this context of reducing nutrient input and generally improving the favourable conservation status of the candidate special area of conservation through the enhanced treatment of waste water flowing into the lakes from the waste water treatment plants in Killarney National Park. I stress that the waste water flowing from the treatment plants is already subject to tertiary treatment. The new measures are aimed at further polishing of the treated waste water to reduce nutrient inputs into Lough Leane.</P>
    <P>As part of this initiative, Kerry County Council became interested in the use of integrated constructed wetlands, ICWs, and examined their use in a Dúchas initiative in the Anne Valley, County Waterford. The use of an integrated system has particular merit where there are many habitats and species interacting in close proximity. This has been an important consideration in selecting sites for ICWs and designing their form.</P>
    <P>Integrated constructed wetlands process water using natural biological processes. ICWs are generally shallow water basins planted with appropriate emergent plant species. They provide the oxygen required by aerobic bacteria and naturally remove excess nutrients from waste water. They are an environmentally sustainable waste management solution which works in harmony with natural ecological processes.</P>
    <P>The treated waste water from the Killarney town and Muckross sewage treatment plants is discharged into Lough Leane in compliance with the appropriate legislation. Discharges are already at standards of best practice having already had tertiary treatment. To improve further the quality of the treated waste water, Kerry County Council and Dúchas officials <Col N="686" /> decided to create ICWs which will further clean the waste before discharge into the lakes. ICWs can also act as a safety buffer if, for any reason, the treatment plants should fail to work properly.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council is responsible for the construction of the ICW in the bog field at Reen, whereas the construction of the ICW at Muckross is being undertaken by Dúchas. The ICWs are within a candidate special area of conservation. One of the Dúchas officers involved in the project is a qualified ecologist holding a PhD in natural sciences. He carried out an appropriate assessment, as required by the habitats directive, and is satisfied that the projects will have a positive impact and no significant adverse impact on the candidate SAC. In addition to the immediate benefits the constructed wetlands will have for the natural heritage within Killarney National Park, they will also serve as an example of best practice in waste water and habitat management for landowners and local authorities elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council and Dúchas officials involved in the project were of the opinion that formal planning approval was not required because of the nature and scope of the works involved. This opinion was subsequently questioned by some members of the public, and Kerry County Council and Dúchas officials decided to suspend operations at the ICWs and review the matter. Rather than enter into a debate and to remove any possible doubt on this question, Dúchas will shortly submit a planning application in respect of the ICWs at Muckross. As part of the planning application, Dúchas will publish its assessment of the projects and will address all issues raised.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ICW at Reen, the Folly Stream, through which the treated water flows into Lough Leane, was dammed to allow the waste water from the Killarney town treatment plant to dissipate through Reen Wood. This was done to slow the rate of flow in the stream which carries the treated water from the treatment plant, thus providing time to allow suspended solids and associated nutrients to precipitate. Dispersing the Folly Stream through the woodland will also achieve a better distribution of the solids and nutrients. The damming measure will improve the hydrology of the woodland and help to improve the wet wood conditions that facilitate the plant and animal communities associated with such conditions.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these works was to intercept and further clean the waste water flowing from the treatment plants to Lough Leane. This would significantly enhance its quality and particularly improve aquatic conditions in the lake generally and at Ross Bay specifically. The use of ICWs will not have a significant negative impact on the SAC. It will enhance the favour<Col N="687" /> able conservation status of the SAC while addressing the immediate concern for Lough Leane's water quality.</P>
    <P>Dúchas officials have publicly offered to make themselves available to meet any concerned parties. A local group, the Killarney <Col N="688" /> Nature Conservation Group, has asked for a meeting to discuss this matter. A senior official of my Department has offered to meet them early next week.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 October 2000.</P>

    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen): Ireland has been very active in pressing for an intensification of the EU's efforts to address the crisis in developing countries caused by the HIV-AIDS pandemic. The Taoiseach wrote to Commission President Prodi in January 2000 urging a revitalisation of EU efforts in the fight against HIV-AIDS. Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, raised the matter at the Development Council in May and sought the mainstreaming of HIV-AIDS into all the EU's development activities.</P>
    <P>The Council conclusions requested the Commission to prepare a framework for an urgent EU response to the health emergency caused, particularly in Africa, by major communicable diseases. The Commission Communication on Accelerated Action was presented in September. The communication sets out the policy framework for urgent EU action focused on three key areas for action: enhancing the impact of existing intervention, increasing the affordability of key pharmaceuticals and increasing investment in research and development. The communication was formally launched at a high level round table, co-sponsored by the commission, WHO and UNAIDS and under the aegis of the French Presidency of the EU, which was held in Brussels on September 28. In welcoming the communication, Ireland also drew attention to the importance of maintaining the EU's long-term commitment to building up the capacity of the health sector in developing countries as a key to the fight against HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>Following on from the discussions at the round table, the Commission will prepare a plan of action, which will outline a series of concrete and practical steps to be taken by the European Union to intensify its efforts to combat major communicable diseases. Ireland has asked that this plan should be prepared in consultation with the member states.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 EU investment in health, AIDS and population assistance, HAP, has reached more than 100 developing countries for a total amount of 3.4 billion euros. This year, the European Union has allocated 20 million euros under the budget line for action against HIV-AIDS. While the Commission has had management problems <Col N="690" /> in disbursing EU assistance, I understand that they expect to be able to fully allocate this funding and that monies allocated under this budget line are on target to be used this year. In addition funds are provided for health sector support programmes in the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, Asia and Latin America and Mediterranean regions.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the new communication and EU plan of action for enhanced action against HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases. We believe, however, that it is essential that this new initiative is followed by a commitment of the necessary resources from the EU aid budget to ensure that the proposals for accelerated action to tackle HIV-AIDS and communicable diseases can be successfully implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of Rockall has in the past been a source of some public legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom. Much of that controversy was due to unresolved fears regarding the division as between the two countries in the maritime area around that rock or skerry. In particular, jurisdiction over Rockall was thought to be central to the mineral rights in the adjacent seabed, as well as to national fishing rights in the surrounding seas.</P>
      <P>However, during the course of the Third United Nations Law of the Sea Conference, which culminated with the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982, this position, in no small part due to the efforts of the Irish delegation, was clarified. Article 121(3) of the Convention provides that: &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Rockall is covered by this provision. Ireland ratified the convention on 21 July 1996 and the UK ratified it on 25 July 1997. Accordingly, both countries accept that Rockall cannot be used as a basis for delimiting their respective continental shelves or fisheries zones.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom continues to claim jurisdiction over Rockall, but this claim is not accepted by Ireland. Each country remains aware of the continuing position of the other.</P>

      <P>The Government is aware of and concerned about the cycle of emergencies caused by recurrent flooding and other extreme weather conditions which continue to take their toll on the people and infrastructure of India. Underlying these concerns are the displacement and suffering brought about by flooding for millions of people, particularly in the worst affected areas of north and north eastern India. Efforts to enhance development throughout the country and to resolve the impact of floods on its population are, therefore, intrinsically linked as far as issues of sustainability are concerned.</P>
      <P>In relation to emergency responses, the Indian Government, both at central and state levels, is engaged in a continuing programme to strengthen national and local response mechanisms which can be mobilised at short notice. These are directed particularly towards annual outbreaks of wide-scale flooding and their impact on the homes and livelihoods of local populations. The armed forces of India have, therefore, been very active in the early stages, both in a rescue capacity and also in delivering food packages. The State governments have taken necessary measures for providing relief to the affected population. Local authorities in most locations have stocks of reserve food and non-food relief goods as part of their disaster preparedness strategy and are emphasising the need for basic health care and the rehabilitation of housing at a later stage.</P>
      <P>In recognising the cyclical nature of natural disasters in India, Ireland aid shares the view that, in responding to them, long-term development strategies must also be addressed. In this regard, the Irish Government allocated £540,000 in 1999 to projects under the non-governmental organisation, co-financing scheme. So far this year, £314,000 has been granted to NGOs, including the Irish NGOs, GOAL and Trocaire. This has supported development projects in a number of Indian states. Moreover, last year, in the immediate aftermath of successive cyclones in the Indian state of Orissa, £200,000 was provided by Ireland aid in emergency assistance. A further £155,000 has been allocated this year to improve the living conditions of families affected by the cyclone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of flooding in India is being dealt with by the Indian Government in co-ordination with the UN and the Red Cross and with the support of international donors. While the Department of Foreign Affairs has received no applications from the Indian Government or from non-governmental organisations working in the areas currently affected, any such requests will be considered. At the same time, our development assistance will continue to support rehabilitative measures including, as I have outlined, those in Orissa. The Government will continue to monitor <Col N="692" /> the situation closely through our embassy in New Delhi, with a view to making further appropriate and sustainable responses through our bilateral aid programme.</P>

My Department takes every appropriate opportunity presented by our ongoing bilateral contacts with Israel to stress the importance that the Government attaches to ensuring the safety of our personnel.</P>

The situation in southern Lebanon was also discussed during the visit to Dublin of the Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr. Nawaf Massalha, in late September. We have been assured at all times of Israel's appreciation for the presence of UNIFIL and its commitment to the safety of the UNIFIL force.</P>
      <P>The Government is monitoring the current situation in southern Lebanon very closely, having regard to the recent tragic upsurge in violence elsewhere in the region. Close liaison is also being maintained with the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as well as the Lebanese authorities. So far there have been no incidents affecting our UNIFIL personnel.</P>

      <P>Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, held a meeting on 9 May 2000 with a group of Kosovar refugees. The object of that meeting was to address their concerns regarding their future status in Ireland. Since then a number of developments have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 18 July 2000, the Government agreed to continue temporary protection for Kosovars evacuated to Ireland last year for a further period up to the end of June 2001. It also approved the payment of a re-establishment grant of £5,000, per single adult, £10,000 per couple and £2,000 <Col N="693" /> for each dependent child to those who repatriated before the end of September 2000</P>
    <P>There was a high uptake of the offer and 715 refugees have already returned home to begin the process of rebuilding their homes and their lives in Kosovo. Another 137 Kosovars have decided not to return at this time.</P>
    <P>Those who wish to extend their leave to remain beyond June 2001 will be able to apply to an ad hoc sub-committee being established for that purpose within the refugee agency. A report on the circumstances of each family will be prepared for consideration and decision by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>The Second Summit of the British-Irish Council scheduled to take place in Dublin today has been postponed due to the tragic death of the First Minister of Scotland, Donald Dewar MP, MSP.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to again pay tribute to Mr. Dewar, a valued member of the British-Irish Council, who was widely respected for his considerable political skills, and for the wisdom with which he guided Scotland through the historic devolution process. Mr. Dewar and I had discussed the council during his visit here at the end of September. I know that all Deputies will join me in expressing our sympathies to his family, to his friends and colleagues, and to the people of Scotland.</P>
      <P>Ireland is very much looking forward to hosting this important meeting and it will be re-scheduled to take place as soon as possible. The focus of the discussion at the next summit will be the issue of drugs, the area of work for which Ireland has taken the lead role within the British-Irish Council. Together with the other members of the council, we are looking forward to examining possible areas for future co-operation on this shared problem.</P>
      <P>The summit will also review progress in other areas of the work of the council, as agreed at the first British-Irish Council Summit in London in December 1999.</P>

      <P>The longstanding case of the m.v. <i>Loch Ryan</i> involves a claim for compensation by Ireland against Germany arising from the bombing of an Irish vessel, the m.v. <i>Loch Ryan</i>, by German war planes off the coast of Cornwall on 16 August 1940. The case has been taken up with Germany at intervals over the years, most recently, as the Deputy will be aware, in May of this year when our Embassy in Berlin renewed Ireland's claim with the authorities there.</P>
      <P>As the German authorities are of the view that all issues arising from the Second World War have been settled, their response to our most recent approach remained as before, namely, that the claim could not be admitted. The terms of this latest response were made known both to the family of the master of the m.v. <i>Loch Ryan</i>, the late Captain James Nolan, and to the Deputy. I have the utmost sympathy and understanding for the position of the Nolan family in their desire to have this case brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
      <P>At a meeting held on 26 July, officials of my Department, the Nolan family's representative and the Deputy discussed in light of the latest German response how the matter should be advanced. Since then, my Department has carried out a further detailed study of the case, taking the views of the Nolan family fully into account. I am currently giving careful consideration to a comprehensive submission prepared by my officials and hope to reach an early decision on it. I will be pleased to keep the Nolan family's representative, and the Deputy, informed of further developments on the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>The Government is fully committed to supporting African efforts to achieve sustainable development, often in the face of the most difficult and challenging circumstances and will continue to work at EU and UN level to that end. African issues have always been prominent in Irish foreign policy, reflecting our earlier involvement at the United Nations in support of decolonisation and the ending of apartheid, and, more recently, our development co-operation, humanitarian and peace-keeping engagement.</P>
      <P>The EU and the member states are, together, the largest development partner of African Governments. At the Africa &ndash; Europe Summit in Cairo in April, which was attended by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, measures were agreed which will allow the EU to build up its strategic partnership with Africa to the same level as its partnerships with Asia, the Gulf countries and Latin America. The summit's common declaration and plan of action for future relations between the two regions stressed our mutual determination to strengthen the political, economic and cultural understanding through the creation of a constructive dialogue on economic, political, social and development issues. Other measures agreed by the summit included the need to define policies to allow African countries to derive the greatest possible benefit from the liberalisation of the world economy, a reassertion of the commitment to cut world poverty by half by 2015, an agreement to consider further the question of indebtedness and commitments by African countries to promote and respect human rights.</P>
      <P>In June 2000, the EU and the 77 African Caribbean and Pacific States signed a new ACP-EU Agreement covering political relations, trade and development co-operation. This new agreement provides for 13.5 billion euros in development assistance over the next seven years, the majority of which will go to the poorest African States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is also fully supportive of efforts by the UN Secretary-General to renew the focus on <Col N="696" /> Africa at the United Nations. At last month's Millennium Summit, Heads of State and Government of the UN resolved to support the consolidation of democracy in Africa and to assist Africans in their struggle for lasting peace, poverty eradication and sustainable development, thereby bringing Africa into the mainstream of the world economy.</P>
    <P>African issues are a significant part of the current Security Council. Ireland, through our longstanding support for political and economic development in Africa, will bring an informed view to the Council. The fundamental challenge facing the African continent is the eradication of poverty. In this regard the Millennium Summit also reaffirmed the solemn commitment to reducing by half the number of people across the globe living in extreme poverty, earning less than $1 per day, by half by 2015.</P>
    <P>The Government also welcomes the increased attention being given to Africa by the Security Council and we look forward to playing an active role in future discussions on the Council. We are particularly concerned about the AIDS pandemic which is a fundamental threat to future African development. The Council has already discussed this issue and we will ensure that this focus will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>In 1997 a major volcanic eruption affected the British territory of Montserrat causing the evacuation of the population to neighbouring islands or to the safer northern part of the island. The British Government immediately responded by providing assistance for emergency shelter and medical needs. Due to the existing damage and the ongoing threat of eruptions the southern part of the island has been declared unfit for habitation. Scientists have predicted that this will remain the case for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Montserrat is now seeking to develop the rela<Col N="697" /> tively safe northern part of the island to make it suitable for the entire population. Over the past three years the British Government has funded a massive development effort to achieve this objective. More than £75 million sterling has been spent to date and this level of assistance will continue for the foreseeable future. Apart from the basic needs of housing and sanitation, advances have been made in restoring health and educational services. Funds are also used to support the scientific team which monitors the volcano and provides advance warning of volcanic activity.</P>
    <P>During his visit to Ireland, the Chief Minister of Montserrat, Mr. David S. Brandt, and his delegation gave briefings on the current situation in their country. Advances have been made in restoring services and infrastructure, for example in the education and health sectors. The British Government is addressing reconstruction needs on the island. To date it has provided the equivalent of £15,000 for every person on Montserrat. Current efforts to rehabilitate the island are not therefore related to disaster or emergency relief but rather aimed primarily at the restoration of the country's economic infrastructure. This is considered essential in order to create the employment and income opportunities which will enable those who fled the crisis on Montserrat to return to sustainable livelihoods. It is also wished to avoid the creation of a mono-sectoral economy and new sectors are therefore being explored by the Montserrat authorities, including for example, that of e-commerce.</P>
    <P>In the course of his visit to Ireland, the Chief Minister was accompanied by Mr. Kenneth Cassell, Director of the Montserrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ms Ernestine Cassell, Director of Tourism and Mrs. Angela Greenway, Director of Development. The focus of their visit is reflected in the organisations with which they had meetings in Ireland &ndash; these included the Department of Foreign Affairs, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the National Software Directorate and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Montserrat delegation were warmly received during their visit in a manner reflecting the historical links between our two countries &ndash; these were also discussed. Options to provide the type of technical assistance being sought by Montserrat were discussed and are being explored bilaterally in follow-up to the visit.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the question relates, an Irish citizen, has been working in Brazil for the past 18 years and is an adviser to the Centre for Human Rights in Manaus in Amazon State. The centre aims to educate the poverty stricken people of the area about basic civil liberties. Because of her involvement in a particular case, the person concerned received death threats some months ago but she has since moved to a different part of Manaus and the threats have ceased. The Irish Embassy in Lisbon, which is accredited to Brazil, has been in direct contact with this person recently and she has confirmed that she is safe and well.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to commend the work being carried out by this person. She has indicated that the philosophy of the human rights centre is one of collaboration and dialogue between Government and non-Government institutions to ensure a strengthening in the public accountability of all those who have a responsibility for social structures, especially where the weaker and more vulnerable members of society are concerned.  </P>

      <P>Progress towards securing the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is continuing.</P>
      <P>Following the restoration of the Executive and the Assembly at the end of May, the institutions are now fully operational again. After an intensive round of meetings in its various sectoral formats, the second plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council took place in Dublin on 26 September, reviewing progress in the North-South institutions to date and agreeing a programme of further work for the months ahead. We look forward to hosting the second summit level meeting of the British-Irish Council, where the Taoiseach will lead discussions among members on possible joint approaches to tackling the problem of drugs.</P>
      <P>Following the enactment of the necessary legislation by the Oireachtas, on 20 July the Government announced the appointment of former Supreme Court Judge Dónal Barrington as President of the new Human Rights Commission in this jurisdiction. The process of appointing the other eight Commissioners is under way and it is expected that the Commission should be in a position to commence its work before the end of the year. An early priority will be the establishment of the Joint Committee with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> There are, of course, areas where further progress remains to be made.</P>
    <P>Legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the Patten Commission is currently before parliament at Westminster where it will shortly be considered in Committee by the House of Lords. In our contacts with the British Government &ndash; including in the Taoiseach's recent meetings with Prime Minister Blair and in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on Monday &ndash; the Government has been stressing its view that a police service which is truly representative of both communities, and which enjoys the full support of both, is an indispensable part of the new beginning offered by the Agreement. It is, therefore, vital that the police service which develops out of the current British legislation is capable of achieving the objectives of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The period of consultation on the criminal justice review is now complete, and the Government will remain in close contact with the British Government as it frames the legislation necessary to give effect to its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Progress must also be made on the question of arms. The Government welcomed the initial report from the international inspectors &ndash; Martti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa &ndash; on the IRA's confidence building measure as positive and significant. I look forward to further reports from the inspectors. The de Chastelain Commission will, of course, also be continuing its work. We also need to see continued progress towards the creation of a demilitarised society in Northern Ireland with an appropriate level of security arrangements.</P>
    <P>The agreement is a balanced document which offers to all of the people of Ireland &ndash; and particularly to both communities in Northern Ireland &ndash; the chance to create a future together in partnership and peace. We should all be prepared to do what we can to build and sustain the confidence necessary to secure its full implementation.</P>

      <P>The Government is actively pursuing its human rights priorities in a wide range of international fora, both on a national basis and in conjunction with our EU partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will continue to fulfil its obligation to promote the observance of universal human rights standards. We will continue to voice our <Col N="700" /> concerns wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. Ireland will also promote human rights issues in the UN Security Council. On taking up our seat on the Council in January 2001, Ireland's continuing commitment to fundamental human rights values will be evident as part of our approach to all foreign policy issues. The obligations we have assumed in relation to international human rights instruments to which we are party will continue to be met in the fullest way possible.</P>
    <P>Given the large number and range of international human rights instruments in existence or under negotiation, signature or accession may not necessarily be under active consideration in respect of all such agreements at any given time. The situation is kept under review in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments.</P>
    <P>In regard to major international human rights instruments, the immediate priorities for the Government are as follows: in relation to the convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, which Ireland signed in 1968, the necessary enabling legislation, namely, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, has been enacted and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated that ratification of the convention will be completed by the end of the year. Government and Dáil approval will be sought in the near future for ratification of, and the making of certain declarations in relation to, the UN Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The necessary enabling legislation, namely, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act, 2000, has already been enacted.</P>
    <P>In regard to human rights instruments within the context of the Council of Europe context, the priorities for the Government presently include the following: signature and ratification of the revised European Social Charter as well as its additional Protocol which provides for a system of collective complaints; signature of Protocol 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which concerns anti-discrimination issues. We hope to be in a position to sign by 1 November at the European Convention ceremony in Rome; and signature and ratification of Protocol 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights concerning equality issues. We hope to be in a position to sign and ratify this protocol in the very near future.</P>

      <P>An informal meeting of the European Council took place in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October. The principal item of business was the Intergovernmental Conference, but the charter of fundamental rights, developments in the Middle East, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the state of the world oil market also featured in discussions. For details of the European Council's discussions on progress in the Intergovernmental Conference, I refer Deputies to my reply to Question No. 7.</P>
      <P>The European Council approved the text of the draft European charter of fundamental rights. In June 1999 the Council decided that: &ldquo;a body composed of representatives of the Heads of State and Government and the President of the Commission as well as members of the European Parliament and national parliaments should elaborate a charter that should contain the fundamental rights and freedoms as well as basic procedural rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and derived from the constitutional traditions common to the member states, as general principles of Community law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Council had agreed that a draft document should be presented in advance of the European Council in Nice in December 2000. It was further agreed that this document should be presented to the informal European Council in Biarritz.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's representative, Deputy O'Kennedy, was unable to give his assent to the draft that was agreed by other members of the convention on 2 October, as the text was still being considered by Government Departments and the Office of the Attorney General. As a result of those consultations, we made a statement at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 9 October indicating our acceptance of the draft on the understanding that the charter will take the form of a political declaration. We are opposed to the adoption of a legally binding instrument.</P>
      <P>The draft will now be presented to the European Council in Nice on 9-10 December. On that occasion, the Council will propose to the European Parliament and the Commission that, together with the Council, they should solemnly proclaim a European charter of fundamental rights. The status of the charter may be discussed at Nice but it is likely that further discussions will take place at a later date. I repeat that it is our view that the charter should remain a political declaration.</P>
      <P>The European Council at Biarritz discussed the current situation in the Middle East and issued a statement. As the Deputy will be aware, the House will debate the situation in the Middle East tomorrow.</P>
      <P>For details of discussion on developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as the meeting with President Kostunica immediately following the Council, I refer Deputies to my reply to Question No. 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also a brief lunchtime discussion on <Col N="702" /> the state of the world oil markets, based on the Commission paper &ldquo;The European Union's Oil Supply&rdquo;.  The thrust of the Commission paper was broadly welcomed by all members of the European Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the aerial bombing campaign by the Government of Sudan against Sudanese civilians and aid agencies in the south of that country and the suspension by the UN of relief flights into the area this summer. The Government made its concerns clear at the time, and in particular at the bombings close to a large UN base at Mapel on 7 and 8 August.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners, we have welcomed the Sudanese security guarantees which allowed flights for Operation Lifeline Sudan, OLS, to resume and we hope that the Government of Sudan will scrupulously honour its undertakings to the UN. We have appealed to the warring parties to comply with the principles of international humanitarian law, particularly those relating to the safety of UN personnel, as laid down in the convention of 9 December 1994 and to free access for NGOs to civilian populations in distress.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to stress the need for a permanent ceasefire in the ongoing civil war in southern Sudan and as an active member of the inter-governmental authority on development partners' forum, we will fully support and encourage efforts to bring about progress in the peace talks, and to reaffirm the importance of a constructive dialogue aimed at stability and co-operation in the country itself, as well as in the wider region.</P>
      <P>We will continue to raise our concerns and to offer our support for a long-term peaceful solution in our contacts with the Government of Sudan and other governments in the region.</P>

      <P>While the establishment of the forum is, of course, for the two legislatures to decide upon, the Government would strongly encourage and support such an initiative.

      <P>On a separate but related matter, paragraph 11 of Strand 3 of the Good Friday Agreement provided that the elected institutions of the members of the British-Irish Council would be encouraged to develop interparliamentary links, perhaps building on the existing British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 114 states have signed the Statute and, of these, 21 have ratified it.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the Constitution is required to permit the State to ratify the Statute and, in this regard, I have asked the chairman of the Government legislation committee to arrange for the draft Bill containing a proposal for such an amendment to be given priority in the Government's legislation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the actual ratification process itself, apart from the need to amend the Constitution and, therefore, the need for a referendum approving such an amendment, an in-depth analysis of the Statute by the Department <Col N="705" /> of Justice, Equality and Law Reform together with my Department, the office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies will also be necessary to determine the exact legislative and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the Statute.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to be represented at all ongoing preparatory commission meetings of the ICC whose purpose is to deal with matters necessary for the effective operation of the court when the Statute enters into force.</P>
    <P>While I am currently not in a position to give a precise indication as to the timeframe within which the necessary measures will be adopted, I assure the Deputy that the prompt ratification of the Statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 49 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of sanctions against Iraq, I refer the Deputy to the reply which was given earlier to Priority Question No. 2.</P>
      <P>The Government is opposed to the US economic embargo imposed against Cuba. We are joined in this opposition by our European Union partners. We want to see this embargo end. We have consistently expressed our view in this regard to the US Government and we have regularly supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for an end to the embargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is encouraging to note that there has been some recent progress on this matter. Following developments during the summer in both the US Senate and House of Representatives, Senate and House leaders on 5 October agreed provisions lifting restrictions on the sale of food and medicines to Cuba. On 11 October, the House of Representatives voted approval of these provisions and the Senate is expected to consider the matter <Col N="706" /> shortly. If these measures receive Congressional approval, they will represent a significant partial step towards lifting the embargo as a whole. We hope that further progress will be made before we take our seat on the UN Security Council and would consider the matter further then in the light of developments and in line with our position on the issue.</P>
    <P>EU policy towards Cuba is defined by the common position adopted in December 1996. The aim of the common position is not to enforce by external coercion of any kind but to encourage a peaceful transition to democratic pluralism, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and a sustainable increase in the living standards of the Cuban people. While opposed to such isolating measures as the economic embargo, the common position nevertheless is obliged to make clear that wholehearted EU co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the absence of fundamental human and political rights.</P>
    <P>The common position is subject to six monthly review and was reconfirmed at the General Affairs Council on 8 June last. This followed a careful evaluation of the situation in Cuba over the previous six months which led to the inescapable conclusion that there had been no substantive change as regards basic political and human rights, and there appeared to be no early prospect of evolution towards pluralistic democracy. Nevertheless, it was agreed that the Union should deploy further efforts to engage the Cuban authorities in a constructive and frank dialogue in the political, economic and human rights spheres.</P>
    <P>At its most recent session in March-April 2000, the UN Commission on Human Rights adopted, with EU support, a resolution criticising Cuba's human rights performance, and calling on it to co-operate with all human rights mechanisms of the UN. The EU, in a comment on the resolution, also expressed continuing concern about the impact on Cuba of the economic embargo. Following the adoption of the resolution, Cuba withdrew an invitation to a European Union Troika at Deputy Foreign Minister level, which was due to visit Havana at the end of April. Cuba also withdrew its application to join the new ACP convention. Nevertheless, Ireland and its EU partners continue to believe that confidence building measures should be pursued with Cuba in the spirit of the common position.</P>
    <P>On the debt issue, although not itself a bilateral creditor, Ireland remains deeply concerned about the high levels of debt in many poor developing countries. Of the 40 heavily indebted poor countries &ndash; HIPCs &ndash; 32 are in Africa where it is estimated that 40% of government revenues are now being allocated to servicing a total debt of some US$350 billion &ndash; to the detriment of health, education and other essential social services.</P>
    <P>Important progress has been achieved since the G8 summit in Cologne in 1999. The World Bank and IMF's enhanced heavily indebted poor countries framework has now begun to deliver debt <Col N="707" /> relief. Thus far, ten countries have qualified for relief under the enhanced mechanism. A number of major creditor countries have also announced their willingness to write off 100% of the debts owed to them by countries qualifying for enhanced HIPC debt relief. In July 2000, the EU announced a contribution of over one billion euros, US$950 million, to debt relief efforts.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this progress, the Government is concerned at the slow rate of implementation of the enhanced initiative and the continuing shortfall in funding. Unless there is an acceleration of the HIPC process through greater flexibility in the application of its conditions and the provision of adequate funding, it risks losing its credibility as a mechanism offering broad, deep and rapid relief from unsustainable debt to the poorest countries most in need. At the recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Prague, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, supported calls for all bilateral creditors to implement an immediate moratorium on bilateral debt repayments for the world's heavily indebted poor countries. Ireland also wishes to see that the special needs of countries recovering from natural disasters and those emerging from conflict are urgently and adequately addressed.</P>
    <P>Ireland has already contributed US$15 million to the HIPC trust fund. We have also provided assistance of £9.5 million directly to a number of heavily indebted countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.</P>

      <P>The ongoing confrontations in the West Bank and Gaza have left a huge number of people seriously injured, many of whom are reported to have been permanently maimed. The recent unrest in these areas has placed enormous strain on local medical capacity and emergency access has proven difficult to maintain. At the same time, the conflict has been of extreme danger to medical personnel seeking to give appropriate and timely attention to its victims. Emergency facilities at local hospitals have been severely overstretched and their supplies have been depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, the Government agreed to respond to a request from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency operating in the areas of conflict to provide urgent emergency medical assistance. UNRWA's request was for US$100,000 and this amount, £91,000, was granted in full. This intervention was recommended by Ireland's representative office to the Palestinian authority in Ramallah which will also <Col N="710" /> monitor its immediate benefit to those who require urgent medical attention.</P>
    <P>This humanitarian intervention was made in response to the situation on the ground and must also be considered in the context of Ireland's wider programme in the Palestinian administered areas. This year £1.8 million has been allocated to the programme including: a grant of £500,000 in support of UNRWA's normal day-to-day activities in relief, health and other social services; over £500,000 for a sectoral support programme with the Palestinian Ministry of Education. Activities include the provision of textbooks, furnishing and equipping of a secondary school and improving the capacity of the general examination system; over £200,000 to Bethlehem University in support for its training and community outreach programmes, in areas such as physiotherapy, nursing, water quality and education; and support was also given to PARC &ndash; for rural development, environment protection and enhancement of the role and status of rural women &ndash; and to a Save the Children microfinance project.</P>
    <P>In addition, the EU has been providing technical co-operation and financial assistance to the West Bank and Gaza since 1996. Recent projects approved by the European Commission's Meda Programme include four million euros for the provision of equipment for the collection, transfer and disposal of solid waste in the West Bank and 14.6 million euros for an environmental and sanitation project.</P>
    <P>Since the US $100,000 humanitarian grant was approved, Ireland Aid has not received any further requests for emergency aid and it is understood that other substantial contributions have been made in response to the current crisis. We are continuing to monitor developments in the region and in particular through our diplomatic missions in Ramallah and Tel Aviv.</P>

      <P>That report highlighted international concern about the serious humanitarian situation faced by the Iraqi people, and full account will be taken of its implications in our continued consideration of the issue in light of developments and in line with the policy I have outlined already.</P>

This includes an accelerated procedure for the approval of humanitarian supplies, in operation since the beginning of March. It also provides for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with a new disarmament supervisory commission, UNMOVIC, and full compliance with all conditions imposed by the security council. I would urge the Iraqi government to co-operate fully in complying with security council resolutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share many of the concerns expressed by the Deputy in relation to the effectiveness of EU development assistance. Ireland, together with a number of other like minded member states, has been pressing for early action by the Commission to make the EC's aid programme more effective. We have been particularly critical of delays in the delivery of EU Aid. Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, wrote to Commissioner Nielson earlier this year criticising the EU's inability to react rapidly to the food crisis in Ethiopia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A series of detailed independent evaluations of the effectiveness of EU aid have concluded that EU development assistance was carried out without any clear over-arching statement of EU development aid policy. The lack of a clear over<Col N="712" /> all policy resulted in fragmentation and inconsistency in the implementation of aid.</P>
    <P>In addition to policy weaknesses, the evaluations also uncovered serious flaws in the implementation of EU development aid. These are most starkly evident in the huge unspent balances, now almost 20 billion euros, which have accumulated over the last decade. The EU aid programme is also characterised by excessive internal bureaucracy resulting in lengthy delays in decision making. The administrative structures in the EU, whereby responsibility for the management of he aid programme is divided between three Commissioners has resulted in overlap and internal co-ordination difficulties.</P>
    <P>At its meeting in May 2000, the Development Council decided to issue a council policy declaration which will provide a coherent policy basis for EC Aid. The statement will be based on a Commission Communication &ndash; EC Development Policy &ndash; issued in May 2000. Work in the Council framework has now begun on the drafting of this overall policy statement which is expected to be adopted by the Council at its meeting on 10 November 2000. The policy statement will make poverty alleviation the focus of all community aid programmes and it will also propose streamlining the programme and focusing EU aid in areas where action at the community level has a comparative advantage.</P>
    <P>In relation to institutional weaknesses, the Commission has responded to the need for reform with a detailed communication on the reform of the management of external assistance which is a key part of the overall Commission reform exercise initiated by Commission President Prodi. The commission communication is a frank admission of the current weaknesses and sets out ambitious proposals for the reform of aid. Under the proposal bureaucracy will be reduced, decision making decentralised, additional staff will be allocated to deal with the backlog of unspent balances and responsibility for the identification and implementation of all aid programmes is to be located in a single Commission office.</P>
    <P>The Commission has also proposed major reforms to the financial regulation which governs the management of the Community budget. The envisaged reforms would permit greater flexibility in the allocation of funds and are designed to prevent the build up of unspent allocations in the aid budget.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council considered the effectiveness of the EU's external assistance at its meetings in September and October. As part of the Council's conclusions the Commission has been asked to prepare a report on the progress of the reform of the aid programme which will be discussed by the Council in January.</P>
    <P>Ireland strongly welcomes the Commission proposals for the reform of EC Aid. We have been actively contributing in the Council framework in the preparation of the EU Development Policy. We also welcome the Commission pro<Col N="713" /> posals for the reform of the management of development assistance. We have pressed for specific deadlines to be set for implementing the reform package. While much work remains to be done, I believe that the package of Commission reforms should put in place the necessary framework to disburse the backlog of funds, and to make EU development assistance more effective.</P>

      <Quest>the discussions he has had on human rights in the context of Algeria's proposed membership of the EURO-Mediterranean Partnership due to be signed on 9 November 2000.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22335/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Algeria signed the Barcelona declaration on 28 November 1995, and has been a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership since that time. The partnership covers three broad areas, political and security co-operation; economic and financial co-operation and social, cultural and humanitarian co-operation.</P>
      <P>The overall objectives are the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights, sustainable and balanced economic and social development, effective measures to combat poverty and the promotion of greater understanding between cultures. A primary goal is to create a Euro-Med zone of peace, prosperity and free trade through the implementation of Euro-Med Association Agreements between the EU and each Med Partner initially, extending to agreements between the Med Countries themselves as circumstances permit. Agreements have been concluded by the EU with Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, interim agreement. The target date for the realisation of a regional free trade area is 2010.</P>
      <P>Ireland places a high value on the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership as a gradually evolving forum for the cultivation of regional stability and prosperity and inter-cultural harmony. During our EU presidency and since, we have played an active role in advancing the Barcelona Process.</P>
      <P>We have held continuing discussions with our EU partners concerning the human rights situation in Algeria, which is a major focus of our relationship with that country, and remains a serious cause of concern. As part of its dialogue, the EU has encouraged necessary reforms, modernisation and improvements in human rights, and has offered constructive assistance through the partnership. In this partnership dialogue, Ireland has sought to maintain a strong focus on human rights and the promotion of the role of civil society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With up to one third of its population unemployed, and one-third under 30, social and economic stability in Algeria are extremely important and can provide the basis for a peaceful future in <Col N="714" /> that country. Negotiations to conclude an Association Agreement with Algeria had been dormant since 1997, but were resumed in April of this year. Negotiations are conducted by the Commission on behalf of the EU. As with other agreements, this should include further commitments by Algeria to democratisation and the rule of law. It is my understanding that negotiations with Algeria are still at a preliminary stage and I do not expect either side to be in a position to sign such an agreement in the near future.</P>
    <P>These negotiations must, of course, be fully consistent with human rights commitments under the Barcelona Declaration. Each partner country in the process has made specific commitments under the declaration to act in accordance with the UN charter and the universal declaration of human rights. The partnership also commits states to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. This is one of its fundamental pillars. Algeria is also party to a number of human rights conventions, including the international covenants on civil and political rights, and on economic, social and cultural rights, and the convention against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It remains our concern that these commitments are fully implemented in practice.</P>

      <P>Like others involved in afforestation, Coillte is aware of the national broadleaf target contained in the Government's strategic plan for forestry. Species selection is, of course, very much dependent on the particular location involved. As indicated yesterday in reply to a question by the Deputy, the national target of 20% broadleaves is being met.</P>

      <P>My Department currently has vacancies for 43 permanent and 28 temporary staff. The details are set out on the following schedule. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, salary levels for the grades in question are determined centrally by the Department of Finance and I have little or no discretion in relation to the salaries which I can offer to new staff. My Department, however, where practicable promotes flexible working and other family friendly initiatives in an effort to attract and retain staff. My Department also has an attractive refund of fees scheme for staff wishing to undertake courses of study in their own time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies Callely and Durkan will be aware, the response of the international community to the crisis in Mozambique resulting from the cyclones and flooding of February-March of this year was centred on short-term emergency relief in response to the appeal of the Government of Mozambique for $1,000 million to meet immediate needs and medium-term rehabilitation assistance based on the appeal at the international reconstruction conference for Mozambique held in Rome on 3 and 4 May in which the Government of Mozambique sought US$449.5 million in international support for its reconstruction programme. Both of these financing targets were met by the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> The emergency phase, involving assistance to those affected to return to their normal life by, for example, providing housing materials, seeds and farming implements concluded in August 2000. The reconstruction phase, using the funds raised at the conference in Rome, is expected to last until the end of the year 2001. The Government of Mozambique is determined that the infrastructure damaged by the floods should be restored and, importantly, that preventive measures be taken to mitigate the effects of any future natural disasters.</P>
    <P>In addition to the immediate £700,000 emergency relief provided by Ireland, a further IR£1.6 million was reallocated from the budget for long-term development projects in Mozambique to meet short-term needs arising from the emergency. Furthermore an amount of IR£4.5 million was pledged by Ireland at the international donor conference held in Rome last May for the reconstruction process. IR£1.7 million of this amount is for payment to the debt alleviation fund established by the Government and will help to relieve the burden of debt on the country. The remaining IR£2.8 million will be used for the rehabilitation of roads washed away in the flood-affected province of Inhambane where Ireland has had a development programme since 1996.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the reconstruction process, Mozambique has prepared its strategy for mid and long-term development, which is vital if it is to return to the impressive 10% growth rates achieved in the past four years. The Mozambican Government has reiterated its commitment to macro-economic stability and poverty reduction. Most Mozambicans, however, still live in poverty, illiteracy and vulnerability to disease and it remains one of the world's poorest countries.</P>
    <P>Mozambique is classified by the World Bank as one of 40 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, HIPC's. At the end of 1998, its total external public debt was in excess of US$8 billion. In April 2000 Mozambique qualified for a comprehensive debt reduction package under the World Bank and IMF's enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative. Total relief from all of Mozambique's creditors under the enhanced framework amounts to US$600 million. This is in addition to relief committed under the original HIPC initiative, worth US$3.7 billion. This is equivalent to over 70% of total debt outstanding at the end of 1998 after the full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms. Ireland has already contributed US$15 million to the HIPC trust fund. Moreover, Ireland provided US$5 million directly to the Mozambican debt alleviation fund over the period 1997-99.</P>
    <P>At a World Bank Consultative Group meeting in Paris on 8 and 9 June 2000, between the Government of Mozambique and its international development partners, additional sums of $530 million for 2000 and $560 million for 2001 were pledged, for long-term development programmes. At this meeting Ireland pledged £7.4 million for <Col N="721" /> the year 2000 and indicated an intention to allocate increased amounts in subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The evacuation programme in 1999 for Kosovar refugees was always perceived as a temporary measure. The refugees were given permission to remain in Ireland for one year.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in July 2000 that the Kosovar refugees evacuated last year could stay until June 2001. Those who decided to return before the end of September 2000 would be facilitated in doing so and received a generous financial package of £5,000 for each adult and £2,000 for each dependent child under 18, to help them re-establish themselves in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>There was a high uptake of the offer among the refugees and 715 Kosovars returned on a number of organised flights between 18 July and 28 September. I sincerely hope that those who returned will be able to successfully rebuild their lives and those of their families.</P>
      <P>Another 137 Kosovars have decided to remain in Ireland until June 2001. Those who wish to extend their leave to remain beyond June 2001 will be able to apply to an ad hoc sub-committee established for this purpose within the Refugee Agency. A report on the circumstances of each family and individual will be prepared for consideration and decision by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Two reception centres have been retained, in Waterford and in Tralee and each is being managed by two assistant managers on secondment from the health boards. The Refugee Agency has overall management responsibility for the programme and has a designated team of a manager, assistant manager and a resettlement officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of programme refugees admitted into Ireland over the past five years are as follows.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 1996, 252 persons from Vietnam were admitted under the family reunification programme. Some 209 of those were admitted between April 1999 and March 2000 which marked the end of the family reunification programme for the Vietnamese community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1979, a total of 803 Vietnamese persons were admitted into Ireland, there were 200 births, <Col N="722" /> 32 deaths and 147 persons left Ireland for another country. We understand that the total Vietnamese community currently stands at 823 persons.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1996, 798 Bosnian refugees were admitted under the Government programme, 623 of whom arrived under the family reunification scheme. Of the 798 admitted, 329 were admitted between April 1999 and March 2000.</P>
    <P>Since September 1992, a total of 1,341 Bosnian refugees were admitted. There were 72 births, 14 deaths and 199 people either repatriated or departed to a third country, leaving approximately 1200 Bosnian refugees currently in Ireland.</P>
    <P>During May and June 1999, 1,031 Kosovar refugees were admitted. There were 33 births, two deaths and 31 persons were admitted under the family reunification programme. Since then, 956 persons repatriated leaving a balance of 137 Kosovar refugees remaining in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some 12 persons have been admitted under the UNHCR resettlement quota.</P>
    <P>The resettlement of programme refugees has been a success as the majority would appear to be integrating well. No doubt problems will arise from time to time but, I am hopeful that programme refugees will be able to rebuild their lives and play a meaningful role in Irish society.</P>
    <P>All programme refugees are met at the airport by a member of the Refugee Agency resettlement team and are given advice on their rights, entitlements and responsibilities. Relatives of persons admitted under the family reunification programmes are encouraged to assist their newly arrived relatives as far as possible. Where this assistance is not available a member of the Refugee Agency resettlement team assists the newly arrived person to make applications to the appropriate authorities e.g. social welfare. Each family is then monitored to ensure there are no early difficulties. A member of the resettlement team is available to families to deal with any problems which may arise.</P>
    <P>As adult refugees become more proficient in the English language, they are directed towards appropriate training from state agencies such as FÁS or CERT or others go directly into employment. Many families require little support following the initial six months after arrival. Other more vulnerable families may require extra support and this is provided by the Refugee Agency resettlement team as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The objective of the programme has been to encourage independence and to empower the refugees to act on their own behalf and in the main, this has been successfully achieved.</P>

      <P>A decision of the EU Secretary General-High Representative on 27 July and an interim decision of the council on 14 August entered into force, on a provisional basis, on the latter date. The effect of these decisions was to restrict public access to certain categories of EU council secretariat documentation which concern the development of the European Union's means for military and non-military crisis management.</P>
      <P>The Government supports the transparent and open approach regarding access to EU information which is embodied in the Amsterdam Treaty. Restrictions on the availability of information should be kept to a necessary minimum. However, there is also a need to ensure the protection of certain sensitive information. The decisions in question have been adopted on a provisional basis to ensure the protection of certain classified material in the security and defence area, so as to facilitate progress in the elaboration of a European security and defence policy. In due course, longer term arrangements are to be adopted in accordance with Article 255 of the EU Treaty, as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty. Article 255 provides for a right of access by citizens to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, subject to general principles and limits to be determined by the council.</P>
      <P>Against this background, a large majority of member states, including Ireland, accepted the interim decisions which came into effect earlier this year, made on the advice of Secretary General-High Representative Solana. The conclusion of definitive arrangements for access to documents can be expected by May 2001 in accordance with the timescale specified in the treaty.</P>

      <P>The main focus of the current intergovernmental conference has been on those institutional changes that are linked to future enlargement of the Union, the so-called Amsterdam leftovers, rather than in the area of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. However, changes to the treaty relating to the CFSP have been proposed in certain areas, and these are currently under discussion. The French presidency and other member states have proposed that flexibility be introduced into the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy. Their intention is to make it possible for a number of member states to co-operate in the implementation of agreed policies. To date, however, the Government have not been convinced of the need for flexibility in this area. The value of the CFSP lies in the fact that it represents the common foreign and security policy of all 15 member states. The debate has still some way to go and some issues remain to be clarified.</P>
      <P>There is also some uncertainty regarding the possible need for treaty amendment in the area of European security and defence policy. There was no agreement at the Feira European Council on this issue and the council indicated that the issue of treaty revision in this connection would continue to be examined between the Feira and Nice European Councils.</P>
      <P>Proposals for some technical treaty changes in relation to European security and defence policy have recently been made and the issue remains under discussion. However, the advocates of treaty change in this context remain in a minority and there is a strong view that treaty amendments in this area at Nice are not necessary.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided the opportunity for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole. The Patten report comprehensively addressed the broad range of important and sensitive issues related to policing. The Government welcomed the report and said that the early and effective implementation of its recommendations <Col N="725" /> would form an essential part of the implementation of the agreement as a whole.</P>
      <P>On 5 May last, the two Governments indicated the timetable planned for the implementation of the Patten report, which included passing the legislation by November 2000 and beginning the process of recruiting for the new police service in April 2001. The Secretary of State published the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill on 15 May and an implementation plan, dealing with each of the recommendations of the report, followed on 6 June. The Bill completed its passage through the Commons on 11 July 2000. It was introduced in the Lords just before the summer recess and is expected to be taken at Committee Stage in the Lords shortly. It is anticipated that the Bill will be signed into law by the end of November and the revised implementation plan will be published thereafter.</P>
      <P>The Policing Bill, as originally published, fell short of Patten's recommendations in a number of important areas. However, substantial improvements have been made to the Bill since then and we very much appreciate the efforts of the British Government in that regard.</P>
      <P>Important issues remain to be resolved, and discussions continue to take place between the British and Irish Governments. The Taoiseach met the British Prime Minister on Tuesday 10 October and also had discussions with him at the informal European Council at Biarritz on 13 and 14 October. I met with Secretary of State Mandelson in London and had further discussions with him in Belfast on Monday 16 October.</P>
      <P>We are seeking a way forward which ensures that the core proposals of Patten are delivered. Progress has been achieved and we look forward to the resolution of outstanding issues in the coming weeks. The objective of both Governments is to achieve a truly acceptable and representative police service which will be of enormous benefit to both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 104 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in Kosovo gives continuing cause for concern. In the run-up to local elections on 28 October, there is a worrying level of violence directed at the Serb minority population and also within the Albanian community. Ireland has been <Col N="726" /> contributing to efforts to restore calm and stability, in particular through our participation in UNMIK and KFOR. We have already sent one long-term observer for the election-monitoring process and will shortly be sending a further seven observers for the election period itself. In broader terms, there are grounds for optimism following the election of Vojislav Kostunica as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The key text governing Kosovo's status and future governance is UN Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted on 10 June 1999. In essence, this provides for a political process leading to the establishment of an interim political framework providing for substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking full account of the Rambouillet accords and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries of the region. Pending the successful conclusion of this process, we will continue to support the operation of the international security and civil presences established in Kosovo under the terms of the Security Council resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Relieving poverty in Serbia, and the entire Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, is a two-fold problem involving the provision of relief aid for current needs and the transformation of the economy to ensure that relief will not be needed in the future.</P>
      <P>Relief has been continually provided over the last number of years to the most vulnerable people, including to the very high number of refugees and displaced persons living in Serbia. The humanitarian needs of these people become most serious during the winter. Last winter Ireland provided more than £425,000 to displaced and vulnerable persons in Serbia and Montenegro. This winter, Ireland will again provide significant levels of assistance to these groups.</P>
      <P>Already this year, the European Community Humanitarian Office, on behalf of the European Union member states, has provided 32 million euros for humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons, refugees and other vulnerable groups in Serbia. In response to more recent events in Serbia, the European Council meeting in Biarritz endorsed an expansion of this aid package to 200 million euros. This expansion will address immediate humanitarian needs as well as some of the longer term obstacles to access and includes, for example, provision for the repair of bombed bridges over the Danube.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal challenge now faced by the Serbian authorities and the international donor community is addressing the broader structural problems associated with the transformation of the economy and society following many years of misrule and neglect. As with other post-Communist situations, the challenges facing Yugoslavia are too great for donor countries to address with sustainable impact solely on an individual basis. The Government will, therefore, continue to support the reconstruction of Serbia in close liaison with our European partners. We will make every <Col N="728" /> appropriate effort to help ensure that, alongside the immediate priorities of reconstruction in that country, democratisation and stabilisation can proceed as quickly and effectively as possible with lasting benefit for all its people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Biarritz approved the text of the draft European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In June 1999, the European Council meeting at Cologne decided that </P>
      <P>A body composed of representatives of the Heads of State and Government and the President of the Commission as well as members of the European Parliament and national parliaments should elaborate a Charter that should contain the fundamental rights and freedoms as well as basic procedural rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and derived from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.</P>
      <P>The Council had agreed that a draft document should be presented in advance of the European Council in Nice in December 2000. It was further agreed that this document should be presented to the informal European Council in Biarritz.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's representative, Deputy O'Kennedy, was unable to give his assent to the draft that was agreed by other members of the convention on 2 October as the text was still being considered by Government Departments and the Office of the Attorney General. As a result of those consultations, Ireland made a statement at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 9 October, indicating our acceptance of the draft on the understanding that the charter would take the form of a political declaration. Ireland is opposed to the adoption of a legally binding instrument. At the informal European Council in Biarritz last week, the Taoiseach <Col N="730" /> reiterated the opinion that the charter should be a political declaration.</P>
    <P>The draft will now be presented to the European Council in Nice on 9 and 10 December. On that occasion, the council will propose to the European Parliament and the commission that, together with the council, they should solemnly proclaim a European charter of fundamental rights. The status of the charter may be discussed at Nice, but it is likely that further discussions will take place at a later date. It remains the view of Ireland that the charter should remain a political declaration. If the charter were to have legal status, then it would appear likely that it would need to be the subject of a referendum.</P>

It was also raised by the special <Col N="731" /> representative of the Chair in Office of the OSCE, Ambassador Albert Rohan, when he visited Belgrade on 8 October. Ireland fully supported these efforts on behalf of the prisoners. President Kostunica noted the concerns expressed and undertook to discuss the issue with the new Government when it is appointed.

      <P>Ireland has used, and will continue to use, its influence in a constructive and sensitive manner in all relevant international fora, including the EU, UN, OSCE and Council of Europe, to protect and vindicate the fundamental human rights of all the people of the former Yugoslavia. With our active encouragement, most of the successor states have themselves been working with these organisations to improve their human rights standards. With the recent democratic transition in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), there is every prospect that the incoming administration will move in this direction too. At the forthcoming EU-Balkans Summit in Zagreb, on 24 November, this issue will be addressed with a view to achieving more rapid progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Human rights are a priority of this Government and a central element of our foreign policy. In co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned States, the Government continually monitors the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world. We believe that the international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns, and that these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
      <P>This Government has commented publicly on many occasions on those situations which give rise to grave concern, in a national capacity and as a member of the EU and the Council of Europe. These concerns have also been raised on a consistent basis by this country's representatives at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. Ireland will also be closely concerned with human rights issues, at the UN Security Council, on taking up our seat in January 2001.</P>
      <P>Concentrated international pressure applied through multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe is one of the most effective means of combating human rights abuses.</P>
      <P>However, despite the efforts of the global community in international and regional fora, it has to be acknowledged that the systems in place for preventing and tackling flagrant human rights abuses do not always prove adequate. Reasons for this range from the failure of states to ratify relevant international instruments to a lack of resources and even political will to focus on these problems. The Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Kofi Annan, has initiated a debate on how the international community can react most effectively to crisis situations and humanitarian disasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> This debate is focusing on the need for clarification of the principles and the establishment of agreed criteria for external intervention. In this regard, there is an evident need to reconcile the requirements of international human rights provisions with other principles such as national sovereignty or non-intervention as established by the UN Charter. Ireland is actively involved in this debate and is currently engaged in the discussion of specific issues with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the Human Security Network. This initiative of the Canadian and Norwegian Governments is aimed at establishing the principle of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to situations of conflict.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards. We will continue to voice our concerns, wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE and the UN Security Council on taking up our seat in January 2001.</P>

      <P>The Government is adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty and accordingly seeks its universal abolition. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. The Government has expressed its opposition to the use of the death penalty on a number of occasions in recent years, and has taken up individual cases where these have been the source of particular concern.</P>
      <P>In June 1998, common guidelines for EU initiatives on the issue of the death penalty were agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers. These guidelines now form the basis for Ireland's concerted interventions, along with other EU member states, in death penalty issues. The Government is strongly of the view that an EU intervention carries significantly greater force than individual bilateral interventions by national Governments.</P>
      <P>The guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where the facts of individual cases suggest a violation of basic minimum standards under international law, the EU will consider making a specific intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> Since the adoption of the guidelines, the EU has pressed for abolition and has also issued demarches on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries, including the United States.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also been and will continue to be active in international human rights fora in relation to the death penalty. In particular, we intend to use our influence at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and other UN fora, as well as within the Council of Europe, to ensure that the abolition of the death penalty worldwide becomes a reality in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>The long running conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea centres on the border area where jurisdiction has been disputed since before Eritrea's declaration of independence from Ethiopia in 1993. A framework agreement, brokered by the OAU in July 1999, was accepted by both governments but could not be implemented because of disagreement on the interpretation of technical arrangements. Fighting broke out again in May this year.</P>
      <P>Following pressure from the international community, both sides returned to the talks at the end of May and in June signed &ldquo;an agreement for a cessation of hostilities&rdquo;. The main elements of the agreement are a ceasefire, a UN peacekeeping mission under the auspices of the OAU, and the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces to the line invaded in 1998 by Eritrea. This agreement is not a final resolution of the problem, but has cleared the way for negotiations, which it is hoped will open shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government has welcomed the ceasefire agreement signed in June in Algiers, and will continue to support Organisation for African Unity, (OAU) initiatives as the channel for a peaceful long-term solution to the conflict. To this end, we have recently contributed $75,000 to the OAU liaison mission to the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.</P>

    <P>Ethiopia has been one of six priority countries for Irish development assistance since 1994. The bilateral aid programme in that country continues to have a clear focus on poverty alleviation through long-term sustainable development, with a concentration on multi-sectoral programmes in Tigray, Sidama and Gurage. Some £1,618,000 has been made available to Ethiopia since the beginning of the year. This funding has been channelled through the world food programme and the Irish NGOs Concern, Trócaire and GOAL, who are operational in the country.<Col N="735" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I remain concerned at the situation in East Timor. With regard to developments within East Timor itself, I am satisfied that the UN mission &ndash; UNTAET &ndash; is making good progress on the work of reconstruction and capacity building in order to enable the territory to proceed towards independence.</P>
      <P>This task is sizeable and complex, but I am pleased that the UN mission is proceeding now so as to set in place suitable structures that can be sustained by the Timorese themselves after independence. A key aspect will be the assumption of responsibility by the Timorese across the full spectrum of administration in all areas, and this is already being addressed by a progressive sharing of tasks and responsibilities within the UNTAET mission and its structures with the local population in what is referred to as &ldquo;Timorisation&rdquo;. I understand that, over the period ahead, more and more responsibilities will progressively be handed over by UNTAET.</P>
      <P>While it is not possible to be definite about dates for the conclusion of UNTAET's work, the present plans are to arrange for elections to a constituent assembly in the second half of 2001. The assembly would then draw up a constitution and, when this has been adopted, a government will be formed.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of these elections, political forces are now starting to regroup within East Timor with a view to forming political parties. While these developments and realignments could have some effect on the current umbrella body of East Timorese politicians &ndash; the CNRT, National Council of Timorese Reconstruction &ndash; the expectation of the international community is that such developments will take place in an environment of emerging democratic and constitutional methods.</P>
      <P>The continued presence of militias in West Timor &ndash; with infiltrations into East Timor &ndash; and the large number of East Timorese refugees still there, continue to pose not only an ongoing security threat, but also a serious impediment to the timetable which I have outlined. The threat of destabilisation resulting from militia activity in West Timor was highlighted in particular in early September by the murder of UN aid workers in West Timor and the withdrawal by the UN of their staff from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international community, including Ireland, both bilaterally and through the EU, has made fully known to the Indonesian authorities our concerns at their failure to deal decisively with the militias and the refugee problem in West Timor. These concerns are currently at the centre of discussions between <Col N="736" /> Indonesia and the UN Security Council and, while the Indonesian authorities have recently taken measures to address these problems, continued vigilance by the international community will be required.</P>
    <P>Ireland maintains its contribution to the military component of UNTAET, with the most recent rotation of our contingent just completed. Further contributions will be decided in close consultation with the UN.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to provide financial assistance in the amount of at least £1 million per annum for the reconstruction of East Timor. The new head of our aid liaison office in Dili will arrive there shortly and I expect this office to be fully functioning as soon as the necessary infrastructure has been set in place.</P>

      <P>The Government continues to be concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe. With our European Union partners, we have consistently called on the Government of Zimbabwe to put an end to the violence and intimidation, and to ensure full respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with our EU partners, Ireland expressed concern to the Zimbabwean Government about violence and intimidation, including the illegal occupation of farms, prior to the elections in June. Ireland participated in the EU <Col N="737" /> observer team at the elections. Although there were a number of serious problems in the way the elections were prepared and conducted, the results appear to have been accepted by the majority of the political parties in the country and we hope that the Government will establish a constructive dialogue with the opposition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of land reform, we have called on the authorities to respect the rule of law and to work for a just and equitable solution in accordance with the principles of the 1998 Land Reform Conference, as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Zimbabwe is not among the six priority countries for Irish development assistance, but Ireland Aid does fund a programme in that country, which is managed through our embassy in Lusaka. The programme focuses on water and sanitation projects in Matabeleland, support to the Southern Africa Regional Institute for Policy Studies and to local organisations combating the effects of HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>Ireland was a long-standing supporter of the Zimbabwean independence movement. The Government will continue to support all peaceful efforts to resolve the present difficulties, and to ensure that the democracy which the people of Zimbabwe worked so hard to achieve will continue to grow and prosper.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the situation in Sierra Leone, which remains highly volatile. With our EU and UN partners, we support a strategy which further stabilises the security situation, repels the rebels, restores the peace process and helps to rebuild Sierra Leone.</P>
      <P>The military situation in Sierra Leone is currently at an impasse, with areas of control remaining essentially unchanged during recent weeks, despite some skirmishes. Half the country remains beyond the control of the Government. Most recent RUF activities were thought to be defensive in nature, although cross-border attacks from Liberia and Guinea remain a source of grave concern.</P>
      <P>We have strongly condemned the actions taken by the RUF in direct violation of the Lomé Peace Agreement of last year, and have called on them to end all violence, to disarm, to release all detainees unconditionally and safely, and to implement the peace agreement which remains the basis for lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and its EU partners are determined that the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL, be given the support <Col N="738" /> needed to fulfil the mandate given to it by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>A recent UN Security Council resolution has extended UNAMSIL's mandate to 31 December 2000 and it is hoped that the strength of the mission will be raised to 20,500 over the forthcoming months. As regards troop contributions, while India plans to withdraw its contingent by the end of the year, I understand that other countries have made significant commitments of troops and equipment to the mission.</P>

There are currently over 260,000 internally displaced persons, IDPs, living in camps or host communities with no means of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland Aid's response to the needs in Eritrea has been timely and even-handed. When <Col N="739" /> first alerted to the threat of food shortages late last year, a grant of £50,000 was made to the world food programme to provide relief food assistance to IDPs. In June of this year a further £200,000 was made available to the world food programme for its humanitarian programme, which provides general food distributions to IDPs and deportees in the camps as well as targeted distributions to the vulnerable in the host communities affected by the war and the drought. A grant of £75,000 was recently allocated to Refugee Trust who are providing humanitarian assistance to families near the border with Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, through its membership of the European Union, has contributed 20,000 tonnes of cereals to the country and £2 million of emergency relief. Ireland will continue to monitor the situation closely over the coming months.</P>

      <P>President Obasanjo and his Government continue to face immense challenges in the quest for long-term political and economic stability in Nigeria following the lengthy period of authoritarian rule and economic mismanagement. The Taoiseach met the President at the Africa-Europe Summit in April and at the Millennium Summit in September and he assured the President of Ireland's support for his endeavours.</P>
      <P>The President's personal commitment to the promotion of democracy in Africa, and his work to revive the Nigerian economy and restore integrity and sound leadership to the country is strong. We welcome the positive initiatives taken to date, and with our EU partners and other members of the international community we will continue to work to promote political and economic reforms, and to co-operate with the elected authorities towards strengthening the rule of law, respect for human rights and good governance in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>In recent months, the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in certain parts of Northern Nigeria, and the efforts by some State authorities to extend it, have exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions there. Tensions in the Niger Delta region are also a cause for concern, as is the recent disruption caused by the recent series of nationwide strikes.</P>

      <P>The accident was the subject of a public inquiry held in the Four Courts in June 1953 before the late Judge Thomas Teevan SC.</P>
      <P>The inquiry found that the Aer Lingus DC 3 aircraft on a scheduled flight from Dublin to Birmingham on 1 January, crashed at Spernal, near Birmingham, with the loss of the aircraft. There were no fatalities.</P>
      <P>The inquiry found that the captain was responsible for the accident by allowing both engines cut out by feeding from the same fuel tank which ran dry.</P>
      <P>The captain's licence was endorsed by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the effect of which prohibited him from flying passenger aircraft. The licence was restored without prejudice in 1977.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the current text of the proposed EU regulation on unbundled access to the local loop, the obligation to provide unbundled access relates to fixed public telephone network operators that have been designated by the national regulatory authority as having significant market power in the provision of fixed public telephone networks.</P>
      <P>In the case of Ireland, at present, this obligation will fall on Eircom which is the only operator, as of now, that has been designated by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation as having significant market power in this area.  </P>
      <P>There is no reason, however, why similar obligations might not be imposed on any operators of networks such as cable or &ldquo;wireless in the local loop&rdquo; by national regulators if, in the future, these operators were shown to have significant market power in a relevant access market and where the conditions at the time justified such an obligation. This possibility will exist under provisions that are being discussed at present for inclusion in the new EU communications regulatory framework that is to come into force in 2003. These provisions will replace those contained in the proposed EU regulation on unbundled access to the local loop.</P>

      <Quest>the benefits the proposed sale of the Whitegate refinery and Whiddy oil terminal will bring to the State, the consumer and the employees concerned; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-binding heads of agreement signed in July 2000 by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and Tosco Corporation in respect of the sale of the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy oil terminal include a commitment by the intending purchaser to operate the two facilities for at least 15 years on a commercial basis, to invest in their development subject to commercial criteria, and to maintain the existing workforce on the basis of, as a minimum, existing terms and conditions. The cash consideration in the trans<Col N="744" /> action is $100 million gross but, when existing INPC loans are repaid, the net receipts to the Exchequer will be substantially less.</P>
      <P>As matters stand, both the refinery and the terminal are restricted by their limited capabilities and scale and their lack of integration into the mainstream oil business. The refinery, in particular, is small and relatively unsophisticated in technical terms and is completely exposed to the vagaries of international oil and currency exchange markets making it impossible to operate on a fully commercial basis. Since it came into State ownership in 1982, the ongoing operation of the refinery has depended on the availability of additional income in the form of a levy on consumers under the mandatory regime (MR) to supplement its income from commercial sales.</P>
      <P>The MR, which is based on the view that the refinery fulfils a vital security of supply function, is subject to annual review by the Government. In the course of these reviews, successive Governments have had to take into account, <i>inter alia</i>, the fact that the justification for maintaining Whitegate has been strongly challenged on a number of occasions by expert opinion in the context of both the EU and the International Energy Agency. Consequently, it has never been possible to guarantee the future of the MR, and hence, the continuation of operations at Whitegate, from one year to the next. In addition, it is necessary to take into account the likelihood that further investment will be needed at the refinery in coming years to comply with new requirements relating to continuing developments in EU environmental policy, such as the EU Auto Oil 2 specifications for road transport fuels which are due to come into effect in 2005. Funding that investment under the existing system is likely to place an additional burden on the taxpayer-consumer.</P>
      <P>The proposed sale, on the other hand, offers the prospect of creating a solid basis for the continued operation of the two facilities for at least 15 years as part of a major oil industry undertaking and without the need for artificial support measures. If the proposed sale goes ahead, it will underpin for the foreseeable future the contribution which these facilities make to security and diversity of oil supply in the Irish market at least cost to the taxpayer and to users of oil products while allowing the State to refocus attention and resources on building up strategic oil stocks and related issues. For employees, the Tosco deal provides, for the first time, security of employment without any disimprovement in conditions over a substantial period of years. It is also reasonable to expect enhanced training and career development opportunities for the workforce in the context of a major international oil refining and marketing operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and the Department of Finance, with the assistance of external consultants, are actively monitoring the proposed disposal of these INPC assets to the Tosco Corporation, and it is my objective to ensure that the finalised pro<Col N="745" /> posals are geared to deliver the benefits for Irish interests which I have outlined above.</P>

      <P>Details of the vacancies are set out in the following schedule. Some 300 of these are posts which were sanctioned earlier this year for new or additional work on information technology systems, cattle movement monitoring, REPS, slaughter and other work.</P>
      <P>All entry vacancies in this Department are normally filled through the Civil Service Commission and my Department continuously liaises with that organisation to ensure that it is fully appraised of our vacancies and of our priority needs. The filling of posts through an open competitive system is by its nature a slow process.</P>
      <P>Clerical vacancies at provincial locations are filled from a service-wide transfer list and this can create some delay in filling posts as other Departments have to await the filling of posts before they can release officers who are on the transfer list.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the importance of attracting and maintaining good staff and keeping them. In terms of pay we must adhere to service-wide policies. My Department has participated in recruitment fairs and is in regular contact with the Department of Finance and the Civil Service Commission to encourage initiatives in this area such as family-friendly policies and direct recruitment. </P>

      <P>The person named applied for 14 animals under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme on 29 October 1999. At an inspection on 27 March 2000 it was found that eight of the animals applied on were sold inside the retention period of six months and not replaced. Three further animals applied on were not in the ownership and possession of the person named on the date of application. Under EU regulations the penalty for non-compliance of this nature is a minimum of one year disqualification from the scheme. The person named was notified of this decision on 7 June 2000.</P>
      <P>The person named sought a review of this decision and forwarded a medical certificate to support his claim. However, following a re-examination of the case, the Department was not satisfied that eligibility of the animals in question could be established. Therefore, the original decision of one year disqualification from the scheme must stand. The person named was written to and advised of this decision on 6 September 2000 and was given the opportunity to appeal the decision to the appeals unit within 21 days. No further evidence or appeal has been received to date.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted two applications for special beef premium in 1999. The second application in respect of 14 animals was received by my Department on 23 June 1999 and was the subject of an on-farm inspection. At this inspection, carried out on 5 October 1999, it was discovered that two animals listed on the application were not in the applicant's ownership and possession at the time of application. This was deemed serious negligence on the part of the applicant and a penalty of exclusion from the 1999 special beef premium was imposed. The person named was informed in writing on 23 February 2000.</P>
      <P>On 30 June 2000 the district inspector carried out a review of the case. He found that the correct penalty had been imposed as the person named had applied on 14 animals when there were only 12 eligible animals on the holding.</P>
      <P>On 1 August 2000 the case was sent to the headage and premia appeals unit of my Department for review. The appeals unit examined all the evidence presented and found that the correct penalty had been imposed. The person named was informed on 28 September 2000 that his appeal was unsuccessful.</P>

      <P>As I have recently outlined in reply to an earlier question &ndash; PQ 19818/00 &ndash; in 1998 I introduced a scheme for tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects. To qualify for the relief the energy project must be in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories and be approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise. The relief takes the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits for an investment in new ordinary shares in a company setting up a renewable energy project. The relief is capped at 50% of all capital expenditure, excluding land, net of grants, for a single project or £7.5 million, whichever is lesser. Investment by a company or group is capped at £10 million per annum, and unless the shares are held for at least five years by the investor company the relief will be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Following clearance of the scheme by the European Commission, I made an order providing that the relief would come into operation from 18 March 1999 for a three year period.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has received a claim from the taxpayer for an allowance for supporting his partner and son since 1982. The information furnished by the taxpayer is insufficient to enable the inspector to determine whether he may be entitled to tax relief.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in tax law under which a taxpayer can claim an allowance in respect of financial support given to a partner to whom the taxpayer is not married.</P>
      <P>A taxpayer who is a single parent may claim the one-parent family allowance for a qualifying child. A qualifying child is a child (a) born in the year of assessment, (b) who, at the commencement of the year of assessment, is under the age of 18 years, or (c) who, if over the age of 18 years at the commencement of the year of assessment, is in full-time education or permanently incapacitated. A child who is not the child of the claimant but who is in the custody of the claimant and is maintained by the claimant at the claimant's own expense for the whole or part of the year of assessment is also regarded as a qualifying child. Furthermore, in cases where a child lives with each parent for part of the year, both parents can claim the one-parent family allowance.</P>
      <P>The one-parent family allowance cannot be claimed where the claimant is living with another person as husband and wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the taxpayer is eligible for tax relief, section 865 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides that a claim for repayment of income tax is not to be allowed unless it is made within ten <Col N="750" /> years after the end of the year of assessment to which it relates.</P>

    <P>1. In relation to the filling of these vacancies, my Department is currently in discussion with a number of individuals who have been assigned to this Department from various Civil Service Commission panels. The post at second secretary general level is in the process of being filled by a TLAC competition.</P>
    <P>2. With regard to your query on the additional steps I will take to attract and keep staff, my Department recently co-operated with the Civil Service Commission and the High Skills Pool in their joint staging of the first ever public sector recruitment fair which was held in the RDS on Sunday, 28 May 2000. The aim of the fair was to highlight the many attractions of a career in the public sector. The fair attracted almost 8,000 visitors and numerous follow-up inquiries from people who could not attend. There were two recruitment competitions live on the day and I understand from the Civil Service Commission that the response to those competitions was satisfactory in the current tight labour situation. My Department will continue to support and contribute to all future such initiatives by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>3. In common with other Government Departments, my Department offers family friendly initiatives such as parental leave, career breaks, job-sharing and flexi-time arrangements and this year for the first time my Department partici<Col N="751" /> pated in the pilot term-time scheme. In addition, my Department offers educational support and ongoing staff training and development. These initiatives go a long way in enhancing the attractiveness of the Civil Service to prospective employees.</P>
    <P>4. A crucial factor in the attraction and retention of staff is the provision of training and development opportunities. The roll out of the performance management and development system in my Department and the associated induction and development programme, should increase job satisfaction and ongoing career development. The system will enable staff to have a greater say in how work is managed and a personal training and development plan will be drawn up for each employee. The end result for staff will be to enhance skills and competencies in relation to both their existing job and their career as a whole.</P>
    <P>5. A working group chaired by the Department of Finance in close consultation with the Civil Service Commission is currently preparing a report on marketing and retention in the Civil Service for the implementation group of secretaries general under the SMI process. I expect the group to report shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the maximum penalties applicable for tax evasion and tax fraud; and if he has satisfied himself that the authorities are pursuing the perpetrators of such offences in a sufficiently diligent manner.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that penalties for tax evasion and-or tax fraud may be applied either by way of civil or criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>In the case of civil penalties, the tax code provides for a range of maximum penalties, depending on the tax and the nature of the default. In evasion cases involving the fraudulent or negligent making of a return, the maximum penalty which generally applies is: </P>
      <P>(i)£100, and</P>
      <P>(ii)the amount or, in the case of fraud, twice the amount of the tax evaded.</P>
      <P>In some instances fixed monetary sums apply.</P>
      <P>In the case of criminal offences the maximum penalties generally are as follows: </P>
      <P>(i)on summary conviction, a maximum fine of £1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, </P>
      <P>or </P>
      <P>(ii)on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £100,000 &ndash; £10,000 to 24 March 1999 &ndash; or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> In the case of false statements made to obtain an allowance, the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment for an offence is a fine not exceeding twice the amount of tax evaded and a term of imprisonment not exceeding eight years.</P>
    <P>Where serious tax evasion occurs Revenue has a policy of considering the possibility of initiating a criminal prosecution. Because of the heavy burden of proof involved and the resources required such prosecution is, of necessity, pursued on a selective basis for cases with the best chance of success.</P>
    <P>Since April 1997, 11 criminal prosecutions for Revenue offences have been completed in the courts. In three cases, prison sentences were imposed. In two of these cases the sentences were suspended, while in the third a custodial sentence of two years was imposed. In seven cases, fines were imposed and in one case the two accused persons were acquitted after legal argument. There are at present 32 cases at various stages of investigation or preparation for the Director of Public Prosecutions and a further five cases are before the courts.</P>
    <P>Where a criminal prosecution or civil penalties are not pursued through the courts Revenue will deal with the matter by a monetary settlement involving payment of tax, interest and penalties as appropriate. Publication of the tax defaulter's name also takes place in accordance with the legal provisions.</P>
    <P>Revenue's general strategy is set out in its statement of strategy 1999-2000. While the pursuit of individual cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners I am satisfied with the overall approach which the commissioners have adopted. The Deputy will, however, be aware that the operations of the Revenue Commissioners, including their approach to investigation and prosecution, have recently been reviewed by my Department. The report of the steering group on the review has been published and placed in the Oireachtas Library. This report will be discussed shortly by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 118 of 12 October 2000, he will provide vouchers to allow civil servants to obtain alternative child care services until the Mount Street service is ready to resume; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in reply to a previous question on 12 October 2000, my Department is working very closely with the Civil Service Crèche Co-operative to reopen the Mount Street crèche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crèche is run by the Civil Service crèche co-operative, with the Government providing the premises free of charge. Up to recently, the crè<Col N="753" /> che had been operated under licence by a manager appointed by the co-operative.</P>
    <P>A recent inspection of the premises by the Eastern Health Board showed that the premises do not meet mandatory child care standards. A number of building and design problems must be tackled before the crèche can be reopened.</P>
    <P>I can now inform the Deputy that a contractor working for the Office of Public Works has already begun the refurbishment. It is expected that the work will be completed on 31 October and that the crèche will reopen for children very soon after that when it has been fully equipped.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the problems that the closure of the crèche has caused parents, but, in my view, the most important task is to ensure that the co-operative can re-open the crèche, with the proper facilities, as soon as possible. The introduction of vouchers would give rise to considerable administrative difficulties for the Department and the co-operative which might divert attention from the refurbishment work.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the crèche will open once the mandatory health board standards have been met.</P>

      <P>In December 1999 my Department contacted the Irish Medicines Board in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy. A report has now been received from the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
      <P>The board has indicated that an extensive examination of the available records has been undertaken. It adds that the preparation of a response required some time to accomplish as original case reports were archived and it was necessary to obtain these in order to compile a response. All original case reports had to be retrieved from the board's archives and manually checked.</P>
      <P>In each case where details of the vaccine batch were available, information on the quality of the batch concerned was sought by the board from the relevant pharmaceutical company. However, I am informed that extensive difficulty was encountered in tracking much of the batch quality data as the companies concerned have undergone mergers since the product was first authorised.</P>
      <P>In the period 1972 to 1996 the National Drugs Advisory Board &ndash; the Irish Medicines Board since 1995 &ndash; received 91 adverse drug reaction reports associated with the administration of trivax vaccine. Many involved minor symptoms which resolved spontaneously within a few days. The reporting of suspected adverse reactions does not establish a causal link between the administration of a medicinal product and the reported symptoms or illness in individual cases. Where vaccination is concerned, cases may involve coincidental illness at the time children were vaccinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following tabular statement sets out the information requested, in so far as it is available. The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that the information provided reflects the verbatim data provided in the case reports and it is acknowledged that some of the batch numbers may be incomplete or incorrect. However, given the passage of time since many of the reports were made, <Col N="757" /> it has not been possible to reconcile some apparently incomplete/incorrect batch records.</P>
    <P>I regret the delay in providing this information to the Deputy. Given the nature of the information requested and the consequent need to examine records now archived and covering a period of some 25 years, it has taken time to compile this information and provide a response.</P>

      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991, provide for notification to &ndash; rather than registration &ndash; and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age. The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services. Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. Article 32 (1) of the regulations requires health boards to furnish a report in writing to the person carrying on the pre-school service of the outcome of an inspection, following an inspection by an authorised person. I understand from the health boards that where appropriate they confirm to pre-school providers, either by letter or as part of the inspection report) that their facility was found to be in compliance with the regulations. There is no provision in the regulations concerning the issue of a certificate of compliance. In addition, health boards are required under section 56(3) of the Child Care Act, 1991, to make available information on pre-school services in its area to any interested person. I understand from the health boards that they provide a directory of pre-school providers who have notified, to members of the public, either on request and/or using their website.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the recruitment of civil servants is a matter for the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission which is experiencing the same difficulty as most other recruitment agencies and employers in attracting and retaining staff in the current economic climate. My Department participated in the Civil Service recruitment fair in the Spring of this year, which was very successfully organised by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Officers of my Department also assist in the recruitment process by participating as members of interview boards, when requested to do so by the Commission. I can assure Deputy Upton that my Department makes every effort to encourage and retain staff by offering a wide range of employment incentives, including challenging <Col N="763" /> assignments, career progression on the basis of competitive interview, flexible working hours in the form of job-sharing, parental leave, term-time, etc., refund of fees and grant of study leave in respect of third level studies. My Department's personnel unit will continue to work closely with the commission in making every effort possible to secure the filling of the above listed vacancies.</P>

As part of the implementation of that strategy, it is planned to develop radiotherapy services at University College Hospital, Galway, to complement services already available from the other supra-regional centres at Cork and Dublin.

      <P>In accordance with the Town Renewal Act, 2000, it was a matter for the relevant county council to prepare town renewal plans, which were to include proposed sites for designation for tax incentives within the area covered by the town renewal plans. In doing so they were assisted by detailed guidelines issued to them; these set out the purpose and aims of the scheme, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans were to be prepared and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sites for designation. They were also advised that when identifying areas to be included in the town renewal plan consultations should take place with the local community and business interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> County councils were advised that the extent of designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
    <P>Town renewal plans submitted by the county councils were then examined by an expert panel set by for that purpose; the panel were confined to examining the sites recommended by the county councils by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines. The panel comprised individuals with a broad range of relevant expertise in urban planning, architecture, conservation, etc.</P>
    <P>In the course of their examination of the plans, the panel sought clarification from county councils on various issues where this was considered necessary. The expert advisory panel exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sites to be designated. The recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations are now being implemented. It is not proposed to make any further designations under the scheme. The sites proposed for designation by the county councils, examined by the expert panel and subsequently approved for designation followed a very detailed, structured and well thought out process. I do not consider that an appeals system is necessary, feasible or practicable. My priority now is to ensure that the scheme is implemented effectively in order to ensure that the desired objectives are achieved.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;deadweight&rdquo; refers to development that is likely to proceed without the benefit of tax incentives. The guidelines for the town renewal scheme required county councils to adhere to a number of principles when selecting sites for designation. These include: scarce public resources must be targeted at areas and buildings of greatest need and potential; the award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to desired development; the selection of areas and buildings for designation must relate to the achievement of the town renewal plan objectives, and the selection process must address certain problems, including deadweight.</P>
      <P>County councils in drawing up the town renewal plans were asked to take particular care to avoid the problem of deadweight and to propose only those sites for which, in their opinion, incentives were really necessary to secure development.</P>

      <P>The terms and conditions of the disabled persons grant scheme were improved in December 1999 when the effective maximum grant was increased to £14,000 with the grant now covering up to 90 per cent of the approved cost of the works. The improved terms and conditions of the scheme apply where works commenced on or after 1 December 1999.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to revise the terms and conditions of the scheme as they applied to works commenced before 1 December 1999 but completed after that date.</P>

Other vacancies will be filled as offers of appointment are accepted by persons on panels established by the Civil Service Commission and the Department.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department in conjunction with other Departments have been looking at the problems of recruitment and retention of staff in the Civil Service in a changed economic environment. The Civil Service Commission set up an integrated marketing strategy and retention work group to examine and report on retention issues and to develop an integrated marketing programme. This report was presented to the SMI implementation group in August 2000 and is being considered by that group at the moment.</P>
    <P>The changes evolving from the strategic management initiative will provide civil servants with <Col N="767" /> a challenging work environment, training, development and better career opportunities in the future.</P>

      <P>The regulations referred to in the question have been recently made to address a number of issues which had arisen in relation to the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1999, including the issue of internal identification for hackneys. This matter was the subject of representations from hackney interests and others who raised concerns about the security implications for passengers of the non-display of an internal sign in hackneys.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the Garda Síochána, the revised regulations were made which include the requirement for the display of information regarding the hackney licence number, the name of the licensing authority, the name, photograph and signature of the driver of the hackney, as well as the serial number of the licence to drive small public service vehicles issued to the driver. These requirements are similar to those which apply in relation to taxis. The regulations seek to ensure that the public should be able to identify the driver of a hackney at all times. Therefore, if a driver is involved in the driving of a number of different hackneys, then a separate sign will be required in each case to comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>The requirement for display of the sign on the rear of at least one of the front seats was included specifically at the request of the Garda Síochána. There are no proposals to amend these provisions, the enforcement of which rests with the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ivor Callely raised this issue with me by way of Parliamentary Question dated 2 June 1999 and I understand he may also have raised it with other Ministers.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the free travel scheme is to enable older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community thereby preventing or delaying the need for institutional care.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the free schemes which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, in April this year, examined the issue of extending the free scheme to include other items <Col N="769" /> of expenditure. The review considers that the scheme as currently constituted provide a basic package of necessary household benefits that ensure a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group. It notes that it is not the business of this Department to provide for all socially desireable items of expenditure. The review recommended that no further goods and services be covered by the free schemes.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment, of £6 per week, to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the review of our Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to caring for our older people by advancing the goal of bringing the old age contributory <Col N="771" /> pension to £100 per week and by extending the £100 commitment to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002.</P>
    <P>In addition, over the lifetime of this Government, all old age pensions will increase in line with average industrial earnings. Significant progress has already been made in this regard. In the three budgets since taking Office, the Government has moved towards achieving the £100 target rate. The personal rate of old age contributory pension has been increased by £18 to £96 per week. The equivalent rate for old age non-contributory pension has been increased by £18 to £85.50 per week.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension at £78 per week equated to 28 per cent of average industrial earnings. The present rate of £96 per week equates to over 30 per cent which is working towards the 34 per cent recommendation of the Pensions Board in its report, Securing Retirement Income.</P>
    <P>These measures reflect the emphasis I have placed on improving the personal pension rates of our older people which I believe is the most effective and equitable way of ensuring that their position is improved. Future improvements generally are a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The special measure which I have introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, is designed to give further recognition to contributions paid prior to 1953. The Act, provided for the introduction, from May 2000, of a special flat-rate old age contributory pension, payable at 50 per cent of the maximum personal rate, to any person who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50 per cent, that is, £48 per week from May, of the standard maximum rate. To qualify, a person must have paid, at least, 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-1953 contributions or a combination of pre and post 1953 insurance.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of September 2000, 1,866 people have been awarded pensions under these new arrangements. As well as inviting applications for this special pension the Department is also reviewing the position of some 13,500 people who are currently in receipt of a reduced rate <i>pro-rata</i> pension to establish if the pre-1953 pension would be more beneficial to them. I assume this is the group of people to whom the Deputy is referring in the question. Up to the end of September 2000 just over 8,000 of these cases were reviewed with 5,217 receiving an improved payment. All payments are backdated to May 2000 when the new provisions came into operation.</P>

      <P>The hoard of Viking-age artefacts discovered at Dunmore Cave in 1999 is currently undergoing conservation treatment in the National Museum of Ireland, which should be completed by the end of 2001. The Deputy will appreciate that, generally speaking, a group of artefacts of national importance, such as these would be displayed as part of the museum's Viking Age Ireland Exhibition, which is the definitive national archaeological exhibition for this period. Some of the artefacts previously found at Dunmore Caves are already on display in this exhibition.</P>
      <P>Should a request be received for a loan of artefacts from Dunmore Cave for display in the visitor centre there, it will be considered on the basis of the National Museum of Ireland's established policy on such loans. However, no such request has been received to date. The museum has previously supplied replicas of artefacts from the caves for display at the visitor centre and it is understood that this has proved a satisfactory arrangement. The National Museum of Ireland will be happy to facilitate any request for the provision of further replicas to the centre.</P>

    <P>In common with other Government Departments, my Department offers family friendly initiatives such as parental leave, career breaks, job-sharing and flexible working hours and this year for the first time my Department offered term-time arrangements to members of staff. In addition, my Department offers educational support and ongoing staff training and development.</P>
    <P>A crucial factor in the attraction and retention of staff is the provision of training and development opportunities. The roll out of the performance management and development system in my Department and the associated induction and development programme, should increase job satisfaction and ongoing career development. The system will enable staff to have a greater say in how work is managed and a personal training and development plan will be drawn up for each employee. The end result for staff will be that they will be able to enhance skills and competencies in relation to both their existing job and their career as a whole.  </P>

The application was processed based on the person's individual circumstances and I decided not to grant a certificate of naturalisation. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that the granting of a certificate of naturalisation is at my absolute discretion and it is not policy, therefore, to disclose the reasons for refusal in an individual case. Furthermore, the aforementioned Act does not contain any provisions for appeal against my decision.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the perceived shortcomings of the present system and the dissatisfaction, in certain quarters, with its operation. While it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the proposals I will bring to Government, I can assure the Deputy that the general thrust of my proposals will be to enhance the role of the complaints board in investigating complaints against members of the Garda Síochána. To this end, I have been concerned to get the balance right and not to rush the review which is, as I have indicated, now close to completion.</P>
      <P>As regards a complaints ombudsman, the recommendations I have before me from the Garda Complaints Board are for reform and improvement of the present complaints system. The board have expressed confidence in the present system subject to the changes they have recommended. I will take account of these, and indeed all other observations, in the review.</P>

      <P>The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, which completed Committee Stage in the Dáil on 10 October, provides for the introduction of separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases where application is made to adduce evidence or to cross-examine the complainant about his or her past sexual experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its 1988 report on rape expressed doubts as to the constitutional propriety of separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases in so far as it might alter the balance of the criminal process and deprive the accused of a trial in due course of law. Subsequent case law has tended to confirm those doubts. Under present law the sexual history of a complainant is only permitted to be introduced into a trial by leave of the judge. The application to introduce such evidence must prove that the evidence is relevant. Since such applications must be made in the absence of the jury, my advice is that what I am proposing in the Sex Offenders Bill does not <Col N="779" /> pose any constitutional difficulties as it could not impinge on the jury's view of the case it is trying. This would appear to be as far as the Constitution would allow such a provision to go.</P>

    <P>The figures outlined represent the position on 30 September 2000 and do not take into account any changes which have taken place since then. A number of the vacancies listed represent new posts sanctioned for my Department and in this regard requests have been made to the Civil Ser<Col N="780" /> vice Commission where appropriate, to assign new staff from their existing panels or in certain cases to hold recruitment competitions to meet our requirements. Furthermore, some of the vacancies listed will be filled by means of internal promotion of existing staff and I understand plans to fill vacancies by this method are also in train.</P>
    <P>My Department is keen to ensure that every effort within its control is made to attract and retain staff. My Department availed of the public sector recruitment fair at the RDS on 28 May 2000, to promote the various career options which are open to potential employees. It is intended to explore other opportunities of this nature to attract as many suitably qualified staff to my Department as possible.</P>

      <P>There are currently 1,480 remedial teachers in primary schools. All schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above currently have access to remedial teaching support. Schools with a pupil teacher ratio below 10: 1 can apply directly to my Department for remedial support.</P>
      <P>The Special Education Review Committee Report recommended providing supplementary remedial teaching support to all pupils at first level, who score at or below the 10th percentile on standardised tests of basic literacy or numeracy or who perform at an equivalent level.</P>
      <P>Details of the average number of students on the current case-loads of remedial teachers are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to the remedial teacher service, pupils with special needs are also supported by the resource teacher service and the special needs assistant service. Since October 1998 the number of resource teachers in the primary system has been increased from 104 to 560 full-time post equivalents. The number of special needs assistants has also been increased from 299 to more than 1,400 over the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> The following ex-quota posts have been allocated to disadvantaged primary schools: 293 disadvantaged concessionary teacher posts, 176 home school community liaison posts, 42 support teachers posts under the support teacher pilot project, 56 early start teachers and 56 child care workers in the early start pilot project, and 102 teachers-co-ordinator posts have been allocated under the Breaking the Cycle pilot project.</P>

      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. While the majority of posts are based in one school only, a number of schools qualified for posts under this scheme on a shared basis.</P>
      <P>The most recent statistics available in relation to this scheme refer to 1999 and are set out in the following table.</P>

    <P>The 1978-79 scheme has, however, been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme. The PESP scheme applies to all schools which do not have a service under the 1978-79 scheme outlined above, providing additional <i>per-capita </i>grants to schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme, qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil, £20 per pupil in respect of each service, subject to a maximum of £20,000, maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
    <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools under the PESP scheme are employees of the individual schools and my Department does <Col N="785" /> not have any role in determining the pay and con- ditions under which they are employed.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January this year. Furthermore, I also recently announced that, with effect from September of this year, I am extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000, all primary schools will, for the first time, receive an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>

Figures for the number of grantholders in the current academic year, 2000-01, are not available at present and the full cost of the grant schemes for the financial year 2000 will not be available until early in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schemes of student support, which issue to the local authorities and vocational education committees each year, have, generally speaking, similar provisions and criteria regarding grant eligibility. Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality. I am arranging for copies of the higher education <Col N="791" /> grants scheme for each of the four years, 1997 to 2000, to issue to the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>if he will undertake a review of the circumstances of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 7 who is on a back to work allowance scheme and who, as a result of a change in the circumstances for his employer, will lose his back to work allowance and, perhaps, becoming unemployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy was originally employed under a community employment scheme that was discontinued in 1999. The person in question was subsequently employed by a school on the basis of funding which my Department makes available to schools to assist them with meeting their caretaking needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme under which my Department provides grants to schools to assist them in providing <Col N="792" /> caretaking services is called the PESP scheme. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which caretaking services are to be provided. Caretakers employed by schools under the PESP scheme are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed. The school that employs the person in question received £4,760 from my Department this year to assist it with its caretaking and secretarial needs. This is the maximum amount that the school is entitled to receive under the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to comment on the back to work allowance, and the person's entitlement to same, as this matter is more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. However I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to seek improvements in the level of assistance that my Department provides to schools for caretaking services.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the grants scheme, maintenance grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree, irrespective of whether or not the student was in receipt of a grant in respect of the first course of study. The person referred to by the Deputy already holds an undergraduate degree and, accordingly, she is ineligible for a higher education grant in respect of further studies at undergraduate level.</P>
      <P>I understand that the relevant terms of the scheme, as set out above, were explained to the person in question in a letter which issued to her on 21 July 2000, which she acknowledged receiving.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the information provided to her, the person in question applied for, and was awarded a higher education maintenance grant, in error, by Dublin Corporation. Subsequently, when the error came to attention, Dublin Corporation informed the person, correctly, that she was ineligible for a grant under the terms of the scheme.</P>

    <P>The vacancies that exist at present include additional posts that were approved for the Department in December 1999, and posts that have become vacant due to retirements and resignations. Every effort is being made to fill the vacant positions as quickly as possible.
