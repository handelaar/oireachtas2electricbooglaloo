    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business shall be No. 24, motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. 43, Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 44, Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 45, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed), and No. 46, Teaching Council Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 24 shall be decided without debate. Private Members' Business shall be No. 104, motion re milk quotas (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any concept of the anger being felt by commuters about a succession of strikes in the rail service and soon in Aer Lingus, the absence of taxis and the fact there is no sense that the Minister for Public Enterprise or the Government is in charge? We have a Minister who interferes politi<Col N="2" /> cally when it suits her and then washes her hands of the problems of commuters when it suits and a Taoiseach who does not seem to take any interest in the subject. Is the Taoiseach informed about the extent of anger at these strikes and what, as the person in charge, will he do? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party and other parties in opposition in this Parliament have attempted to raise the issue of access to transport on a number of occasions. The crisis has now reached a proportion that warrants a special emergency debate in this House. I ask the Taoiseach to respond to the questions posed by Deputy John Bruton, which I support. There is widespread anger and frustration at the prospect of a fourth Christmas under this Administration when it will be impossible to get a taxi in the centre of Dublin city, despite many promises. If this House is to remain relevant and this Government is to remain in office, they must address this problem in a comprehensive way.</P>

      <P>As regards taxis, unfortunately, the Government's decision to issue 3,100 taxi licences was challenged by the hackney men many months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That judgment has been made and the orders have been laid by the eminent justice. New orders must now be introduced by the Minister and, as I said yesterday, that will be done in a number of days. It is regrettable that the attempt to issue 3,100 taxi licences, which would have been in addition to several hundred issued by the taxi forum in 1997 and to the nil increase in taxis licences when Deputy John Bruton was Taoiseach, was thwarted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards public transport and the industrial relations issue in CIE, a number of disputes are before the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission after consultation with the social partners and many meetings with the Minister for Public Enterprise and various Ministers about the strikes. The Minister is making arrangements to meet the parties involved to discuss the industrial relations difficulties in Iarnród Éireann and to find a way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the findings of the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, which are the industrial relations machinery of the State, in many disputes across a range of areas have been turned down. As Deputy Quinn knows from the time he was Minister for Labour, that is regrettable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the answer he has just given is characteristic of his approach to many other issues, namely, that wherever there is a problem, he blames someone else, in this case, the hackney drivers? The Taoiseach is running out of excuses and people to blame. The truth is there is a poisonous relationship between the Minister and the board of CIE, which has been generated in considerable measure by herself, and she does not have the characteristics required to intervene successfully in such a matter other than to undermine the board. The difficulty is that we have had bad management at the top as far as public transport is concerned over the past three years. This has been typified by the Government's relationship with CIE and its failure to deal with the taxi issue until forced into it. The public does not have a sense that the Government is in charge of this issue. These are public services and the Government is unable to deliver a public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct Deputy John Bruton. The Government acted, first through the taxi forum and the announcement of additional taxi licences in 1997 and 1998.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These were issued through the Carriage Office in the city. In addition, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, made the excellent decision to award an additional licence to every taxi driver in the State, totalling 3,100 licences. Unfortunately, another group challenged that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to offend the Taoiseach by asking a nasty question because he is sensitive about these matters. It is our job to ask questions on behalf of the people who elect us. When will the citizens of Dublin see extra taxis on the street?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am not interrupted I will answer the question. The Government allocated a mechanism to provide for an additional 3,100 taxis. Deputy Quinn will know we do not have the jurisdiction to ignore the courts. Following an objection from hackney drivers the courts decided on the issue. The licences would have been allocated before the summer but for the court proceedings. Mr. Justice Murphy only issued the final orders from his judgment yesterday and the Minister will introduce orders in the next day or two.</P>
      <P>The Minister allocated several hundred additional taxi licences through the taxi forum in 1997 and 1998. In 1999 he attempted to provide for an additional 3,100 licences. He cannot be blamed for what has happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the chaos in transport will the Taoiseach agree to prioritise the railway safety Bill, which the Government will apparently not introduce until late next year, and the transport Bill, the purpose of which is to establish a railway infrastructure procurement agency, which is surely urgent in view of the difficulties faced by many railway lines and which is also not promised until late next year? Does he agree that what we need is not talk or debates, but action from the Government to deal with the chaos that is occurring in an area in which it is a monopoly owner?</P>

There are 70 heads to the transport Bill, the purpose of which is to regulate the on-street running of light rail, to make provision for public-private partnership related matters and to regulate the physical operating environment of light rail.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The all-party committee on the Constitution will publish a report today which has been extensively discussed in advance and comprehensively leaked. I understand, and will the Taoiseach confirm, that this matter will, in the first instance, be referred to a sub-committee of the Cabinet for consideration and that in due course it will, through the Cabinet, make a recommendation concerning legislation on this issue? What is the Taoiseach's anticipated timetable concerning legislation that might arise from the deliberations of the Cabinet sub-committee and when is the House likely to see such legislative proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that legislation will arise. Members of the Cabinet sub-committee have not seen the report, so it would be too early for me to say how long it will take or what deliberations will be necessary on the issue.</P>

      <P>On numerous occasions over the <Col N="8" /> past three years I have raised questions on the introduction of private security legislation and the Taoiseach has informed me it will be introduced some time this year. That has not yet happened.</P>
      <P>Last night it was reported that doormen around the country have introduced self-regulation to stop INLA members from managing night club doors around this city. It is an indictment of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that legislation has not been introduced to this House and that the doormen have now introduced self-regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very interesting legislation because it is intended to introduce a degree of regularity and common sense in an area in which we have witnessed significant problems and lack of common sense. One of the five main policy <Col N="12" /> areas touched on by the commission which will be established by this Bill is the approval of airport and air traffic controls. It makes sense for such a sensitive and significant issue to be in the control of a stand-alone commission.</P>
      <P>A second policy area relates to the approval of ground handling service providers. We have witnessed the introduction of private enterprise operations in this area and it is only proper that an independent regulator would handle that issue. This is a common sense proposition.</P>
      <P>The granting of operating licences to air carriers will also become one of the commission's responsibilities and I welcome that. The Minister has made a very sensible and prudent decision to have the potentially controversial allocation of take-off and landing slots dealt with by a commission which is regarded as independent and which will objectively examine and regulate equally the airport operator and the airlines. There has been much competitive jostling in the airline business, both here and internationally, on the issue of take-off and landing slots, which can confer considerable advantages on companies. There has been some argument that at least one operator feels it has been disadvantaged in this area, particularly at Dublin Airport which has now reached a critical capacity. I hope the hand wringing, crying wolf and whinging we have heard about this issue in the past will be consigned to oblivion.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides the commission with a very important role in licensing and bonding travel agents and tour operators. Licensing and bonding travel agents and tour operators has been a very thorny and controversial issue over the years. I live in Bray and I am familiar with one major collapse a number of years ago where an operator was taking deposits from unfortunate people up to one hour before the company was liquidated and went bottom up. Given the degree of additional affluence and that margins and competition in the business are very tight, there is a need for independent regulation and I commend the Minister for the provisions she has included in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her speech on Second Stage the Minister outlined in detail the background to the legislation and touched on one significant area, namely, the rationale for the changes, particularly in terms of airport charges and tariffs and the discount regime operated by Aer Rianta over the years. I do not want to portray myself as a spokesperson for Aer Rianta, but it has been much maligned on the issue of charges, particularly by one airport operator which spends its time whinging and pointing the finger while the manner in which it handles its own relationship with its staff and customers is, to say the least, less than savoury. Looking at the tariffs and charges which the company has operated over the years and given that it was operating in a very limited market in which most international operators were not concerned, all in all it has served the State and the <Col N="13" /> aviation industry very well and this should be put on record. The men and women who work for Aer Rianta are adversely affected by unfair, unjust and, frankly, unfounded criticism.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, Aer Rianta suffered a major loss in its revenue capacity with the ending of duty free sales. Imprudent and unjustifiable decisions taken in the early 1990s by the European Community, driven more by ideology than by common sense, have had a major impact on the airline industry and on airport operations not just in Ireland but elsewhere. Ireland can be proud that we originated and Aer Rianta very successfully developed the idea of international duty free sales. Aer Rianta did so not just in Ireland but as things began to thaw in the former Soviet Union, it developed extremely successful international businesses in this area.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the ending of duty free sales airport charges have been affected. To hear one operator talking about introducing packages which would allow an aeroplane to land and take off on the basis of a charge of 50p per passenger is utterly ludicrous and nonsensical. It makes no economic sense to talk in those terms. Aer Rianta has invested taxpayers' money in the airports and it is reasonable that it has a reasonable level of charges, to be in a position to replace its major loss from duty free sales and get on with its general business without passing the cost of developing that business on to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta had a cushion for many years arising from duty free sales and its non-indigenous or out-of-State activities. Sadly, because of decisions taken purely on the basis of ideology by the European Commission, which did not deny itself the benefit of duty free sales, Aer Rianta and other airport operators around the world have found themselves in a difficult situation, which has given rise to changes in airport charging.</P>
    <P>It is good that a commission which can be regarded as separate will be able to deal with airport charges and air traffic charges, and it will, I hope, end the unseemly whinge which has come from a particular quarter which does not cover itself in glory in the manner in which it handles its staff, trade union relations or many of its customers. That is not to say Aer Rianta should not be criticised &ndash; it should be from time to time &ndash; but criticism must be fair and focused.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises is the current capacity of Dublin Airport. There is a lively debate about private capital being introduced to address some of the major difficulties which currently exist at the airport. Notwithstanding the very significant level of investment at the airport, it is clear that the current capacity of the airport is operating to breaking point. Aer Rianta has invested significantly and there is additional terminal space, which has eased things somewhat, although criticisms could be made in terms of aesthetics and how the changeover has been managed. The reality is there is an urgent need to examine the air traffic capacity at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conor Lenihan suggested it was time <Col N="14" /> to examine the opening of Baldonnel to civilian air flights, a very sensible proposition. There will be difficulties with Baldonnel because of the pattern of housing development in the area over the years and the siting by Dublin city planners &ndash; if that is not an oxymoron &ndash; of some of the new conurbations close to Baldonnel. These will raise certain challenges, but a second airport sited at Baldonnel should be examined. Dublin Airport is operating to capacity and it determines the pattern of development in north County Dublin and the adjoining counties. Perhaps Baldonnel could initially handle charter or light commuter traffic. It seems there is a case to be made. In terms of my constituency, it would have very significant benefits because the economic benefits of developing a second airport in the Dublin area would be considerable for the surrounding countryside. There is very vibrant economic and business development in the vicinity of Baldonnel, which has significant capacity. Members will remember that when the original Potez arrangements were being made, much money was invested in upgrading the runways. There is space for further upgrading of the runways and flight patterns and paths could be adapted. The necessity of considering further controversial runway space at Dublin Airport could be obviated if we allowed Baldonnel to develop. Initially, Baldonnel could be developed as a location for commercial executive jets and handle many of the short haul flights and internal business, including that with some of the minor airports in the UK.</P>
    <P>Certainly Baldonnel could become the hub for business development and in the medium to long term it should also become the hub for all major tour operations. The Bill is sound legislation and is well based. There has been some criticism of our propensity in this House to establish so-called independent commissions and, therefore, to remove from the doctrine of ministerial responsibility significant areas of public administration. From time to time I have a great deal of sympathy with this argument. I believe the areas covered by the Bill &ndash; regulation in the area of charges, regulation as to who will get ground handling contracts, regulation about operating licences, regulation governing bonding and the general operations of tour operators and, above all, regulation of slots and landing spaces in airports &ndash; do not go to the heart of public administration and do not lend themselves to cover by the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. By their nature they are areas which are commercial in their orientation and should be taken out of the maw of the general Civil Service bureaucracy and out of the controversy in which they have been artificially landed recently.</P>
    <P>The best and most objective way of doing that is by the means proposed by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, an innovative Minister who has done good work in a very challenging portfolio. It will have a beneficial effect for operators and passengers and, I hope, economic benefits. If the proposition that we look at a second airport comes up <Col N="15" /> it will have direct benefits for my constituency &ndash; ever parochial, but then all politics are local.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the Aviation Regulation Bill. I recall the statement by James Dillon many years ago that the rabbits would be running all over Rineanna and also the statement by the then Minister for Transport, Peter Barry, in the period 1984-87 that there was no need to put in an extension at Cork Airport. Both were proved wrong. I have been listening to many contributions from the Opposition which are hysterical, impractical and bordering on lunacy. The Opposition will be wrong again in regard to the manner in which it has approached this legislation. If one came to this island from outer space and listened to the contributions on the Bill and then went to any of the airports, one would ask whether we are in the same world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will say things are perfect in any of our airports. That is due to the economy progressing in the way it has in the past few years, with more people travelling by rail, road and air. The infrastructure had not been prepared for the vast numbers travelling and we see the problems it has caused. The Government, in helping Aer Rianta, has plans in place to develop and raise the standards at our airports. I shall speak specifically on Cork Airport.</P>
      <P>Plans have been put in place by Aer Rianta to spend more than £60 million over the next five years in the development of Cork Airport on four main elements &ndash; to develop the airfield, to develop the passenger terminal, to develop the cargo facilities and access. A sum of £6 million has been spent this year on the development of the apron. The concrete service has been upgraded and the life of the runway has been extended by 15 to 20 years. Another project &ndash; a further extension to the apron and a new taxi way &ndash; costing £8 million has been decided upon and will take 18 months to complete. At the passenger terminal it is planned to increase the capacity to handle 2.5 million passengers per annum by 2003 and to facilitate further expansion thereafter to handle up to five million passengers in the medium to long term. A design team is working on the specification for these new facilities. A sum of £33 million is to be spent on the passenger terminal upgrade in the first phase, £5.5 million in 2001, a further £5.5 million in 2002, with the remainder to be spent in 2003. The long-term planning is going ahead and it will cater for the numbers forecast to come through the airport in the next five years.</P>
      <P>Approximately £2.5 million will be spent over the next 12 to 18 months to upgrade the cargo facilities. Given the increase in exports in the past four or five years there is a need to upgrade these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> Airport access is another area that has to be taken into account, for which £12 million has been set aside for expenditure over the next three years. It will be clear from those figures that Aer Rianta, with support from the Government, is spending vast sums of money to bring Cork Airport up to the standard needed to cater for the numbers forecast to go through in the next few years. This is continuing action, rather than talk, by the Fianna Fáil-led Government. We took such action in the past when in government and we are doing so again.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Roche that the new commission which is to be set up is to operate in an administrative capacity rather than in the policy area which must always be determined by the Government of the day. It is right to set up an administrative body independent of Government and the air carriers. The areas mentioned in the Bill relate to the approval of airport and air traffic control charges. It is important that the body set up should be independent so that the users are not in control of what would be charged to themselves. It is important that the ground handling service is independent of any of those bodies. On the question of the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland, the proper way to do this is through an independent commission. On the issue of the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators, it is important that all those involved in this business are properly licensed and bonded. It is important also to have a commission that will carry out examinations and audits of these agents and licensing authorities.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. It is innovative and will progress all elements of air traffic business in the country.</P>

The aviation industry is hugely important in world terms from the point of view of business, trade, commerce, tourism and general economic development. It is particularly important to an island state such as Ireland. Every aspect of our economic development is dependent on easy and ready access. Everyone agrees that the present position could be greatly improved. If this Bill contributes to such an improvement it certainly will be well worthwhile. The aim of the Bill is to regulate five main areas of airport operations, namely, airport charges, ground handling service personnel, the granting of operating licences to carriers established in this country, the administration of rules governing the allocation of landing and take-off slots at airports and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators.</P>

    <P>The Bill covers operations at Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports, all of which are State owned. However, its remit seems to be confined to airports with a throughput exceeding 1 million passengers per annum. The situation at Dublin Air<Col N="17" /> port is often chaotic with people standing two or three deep at the desks. While they do their best, the desk staff cannot cope efficiently or quickly when there is a rush. Why are so many check-in desks closed during peak periods? If all the desks were staffed we would avoid the long queues which lead to frustration at the commencement of journeys.</P>
    <P>In excess of 14 million passengers travel through Dublin Airport each year. Our objective should be to have Dublin Airport recognised as one of the most efficient airports in Europe, if not in the world. However, it currently comes a long way down the efficiency league. There are long delays when checking in, longer delays when collecting baggage and chaos at the taxi rank. All of these factors leave visitors to Ireland with a negative impression of how we operate the main point of entry to the country. The Minister would agree that the position needs to be greatly improved. On the other hand, passengers travelling into Dublin city from the airport will be impressed by the thoroughfare, particularly in the spring when daffodils line the route. I do not travel through Dublin Airport regularly but the route into the city centre from the airport is very impressive.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers the operation of our three main airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork but does not address the needs of regional airports which have greatly contributed to economic development. I am concerned by the situation of Donegal airport at Carrickfinn which services one of the most peripheral areas in the country. The region is 200 miles from Dublin, more than 100 miles from Belfast and 85 miles from Sligo. Donegal has no rail service which gives added importance to an air link. In light of these facts, it is unbelievable that the national development plan overlooked the N2 which is the main route connecting Dublin to Derry and my part of Donegal. Most of the other spurs to Cork, Belfast, Limerick and Galway are being upgraded to dual carriageway or motorway status but the main link to Donegal and the north-west will be the subject of very little development.</P>
    <P>If the airport facilities at Carrickfinn are properly developed and supported this would give a tremendous boost to the economic development of County Donegal. Unemployment in the county is at the unacceptably high level of 17% while the national average is 4%. Donegal has some of the worst roads in the country and has no rail services. This illustrates the unrealised potential of the airport at Carrickfinn. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is familiar with the airport and has visited it in an official capacity. I am sure she would agree that the facilities are second to none. I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has had the opportunity to visit the airport. He has been to Donegal on several occasions in the past year or so but perhaps he will visit Carrickfinn airport and familiarise himself with its fine facilities.</P>
    <P>There is one flight to Dublin from Carrickfinn <Col N="18" /> each day. The flight leaves Dublin Airport at midday and arrives in Carrickfinn at about 1 p.m. It leaves Carrickfinn at about 2 p.m. and arrives in Dublin at 3 p.m. However, this service is not tailored to serve the needs of the business community. Most people who want to do business in Dublin would like to leave Donegal at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m., arrive in Dublin one hour later, do their business and take a flight back to Carrickfinn in the evening. Unfortunately they cannot do so at present.</P>
    <P>The community and business people in west Donegal were very disappointed earlier this year when the existing PSO routes were being renewed and there was no application for a second daily flight to Donegal. Why is the Department seeking tenders for only one flight per day on the Dublin-Donegal-Dublin route under the essential air services programme while all other regional airports are being given two or three flights per day?</P>
    <P>There is a business demand for a same-day return flight to Donegal. I estimate that between 600 and 1,000 people travel by coach from Donegal to Dublin every day. If only 5% or 10% of these passengers availed of the air service it would be viable. Many patients are obliged to travel to Dublin for oncology and chemotherapy treatment. The North Western Health Board operates and funds a system under which people can avail of the flight from Donegal to Dublin at a subsidised rate whereby the return fare is £20. However, because of the timetable these people have to spend a night in Dublin. Many of these patients need to spend only an hour or so in Dublin and wish to return to Donegal the same evening but the flight timetable does not facilitate them. The only solution is a service which leaves Donegal early in the morning and returns late in the evening.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol don Aire tá aer-thaisteal an-tábhachtach anois do chúrsaí eacnamaíochta agus d'fhorbairt eacnamaíochta. Sílim go bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith ag na haerphoirt réigiúnda mar cuireann siad ar chumas na réigiún dul in iomaíocht leis an chuid eile den tír agus le cathracha ar nós Baile Átha Cliath nuair a thagann sé go dtí cúrsaí eacnamaíochta.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don aerphort i dTír Chonaill atá suite sa Ghaeltacht agus atá airgeadaithe ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Aerphort den scoth atá ann agus sílim go bhfuil úsáid iomlán á bhaint as i láthair na huaire Ach is easnamh mór é nach féidir le muintir Dhún na nGall taisteal go Baile Átha Cliath ar an eitleán ar maidin agus teacht abhaile arís tráthnóna. Is mór an trua nach bhfuil aon rud sa Bhille seo fá choinne an scéal sin a leigheas. Tá fhios agam gur bhuail toscaireacht leis an Aire cúpla seachtain ó shin, gur éist sí leis na gearáin a bhí ag an toscaireacht sin, agus gur chuir siad in a luí ar an Aire chomh tábhachtach is atá sé go mbeadh deis ag muintir Thír Chonaill taisteal go Baile Átha Cliath ar maidin agus a bheith sa bhaile tráthnóna. Tá fhios agam go bhfuil seirbhís idir Baile Átha Cliath <Col N="19" /> agus Doire agus cuirim fáilte roimh an tseirbhís sin. Tá sé tábhachtach go leanfaí ar aghaidh leis an tseirbhís sin ach ní leor an tseirbhís sin chun freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta i dTír Chonaill nó ar mhuintir iarthar an chontae. Iarraim ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas mar sin athmhacnamh a dhéanamh ar an cheist seo agus chomh luath agus is féidir deis a thabhairt dúinn sa Ghaeltacht agus in iarthar an chontae teacht ar eitleán go Baile Átha Cliath ar maidin agus filleadh abhaile tráthnóna an lá céanna. Tá mé buartha nach bhfuil sé sin sa Bhille seo agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire agus an Rialtas an cheist a scrúdú agus é a chur in a cheart chomh luath agus is féidir.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. Those of us who have been reading the newspapers in recent months are quite concerned about the near misses reported. Obviously the regulations included in the Bill are timely and are welcomed by everybody.</P>
      <P>Setting up the commission to look at the bonding arrangements for travel companies is another timely intervention. We can all recall the companies which have gone to the wall. The case which is stuck in the minds of Cork people is the World Cup fiasco in the United States, where arrangements were made for individuals travelling to the World Cup who found not only that they did not have hotel reservations but in some instances that they had no tickets. The resulting difficulties led to a number of companies going to the wall. From that point of view the Bill is also welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill also gives me the opportunity to speak about the developments at Cork Airport compared with those at other airports. Cork Airport is regarded as the third international airport in Ireland. Looking at the success and growth of this airport compared with that of some of the others is a lesson in itself. There is major uncertainty about Cork Airport and the direction of its future development. That, in itself, is disconcerting. I have been a thorn in the side of the management and board of Aer Rianta because of the lack of investment in Cork over the years. I have always felt that Aer Rianta regards Cork Airport as the third airport which must be developed in time. However, such development will not be timely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of my ongoing interventions with the Minister and the board of Aer Rianta, last year in September the chairman of Aer Rianta announced formally the investment of £60 million at Cork Airport. Later in the year the chairman of Aer Rianta visited Cork and added fuel to the fire. During the visit he asked where the money was to come from, even though there had been an announcement in September. It would be quite accurate to say that a sod has not been turned at Cork Airport in the intervening 12 months. I am pleased, however, to note that, again as a result of ongoing rowing with the board of Aer Rianta and the welcome intervention of the Minister, <Col N="20" /> there now seems to be tangible evidence that this investment will go ahead.</P>
    <P>It is also important to compare what has happened at Cork Airport with developments at its sister airport at Shannon. Roughly 1.7 million passengers use each of the two airports. While we in Cork wish Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport well and welcome the growth of both airports, we demand fair play and equitable treatment. We believe Cork Airport is not being treated equitably even though a similar number of passengers use Cork Airport and Shannon Airport. We are particularly concerned, for instance, that this year's marketing budget for Cork Airport is in the order of £450,000. It is interesting to note that the budget for Shannon Airport was £3 million over the past few years and there is even a suggestion that this year that budget might be as high as £5 million. That is not equitable, even though the passenger throughput is similar.</P>
    <P>Previously I have stated publicly that we in Cork look at the markets we developed in Europe and the way the charter flights have been weaned away from Cork Airport suddenly to appear at Shannon Airport and ask, &ldquo;How has this arisen?&rdquo;  Is it because they have a larger marketing budget or because inducements have been offered to these European charter companies? Is that why Shannon Airport has benefited enormously? Certainly we in Cork believe this is the case. This is the view held by many Cork people, particularly those who work at Cork Airport. There is no co-ordination of European marketing activity by Aer Rianta. If there are three international airports, why should one be pick-pocketing from another? Why is there no strategic plan to develop European charter services for the three airports? If Dublin is overloaded with traffic, why, particularly in the context of European charter services for tourists, does Aer Rianta not look seriously at the regional development of which the Government and every party in the Chamber speak? Since the bilateral agreement between the US and Ireland was changed and trans-Atlantic flights were allowed land in Dublin, anybody who looks at the development of tourism in Ireland will see clear evidence that Dublin and the east coast have benefited greatly from the tourist traffic. Whether in summer or winter, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get hotel accommodation in Dublin, irrespective of the enormous growth in the number of hotels in the city. Perhaps the time has come to review the development of Dublin and the regions and what is being done to attract tourists to Ireland. The review of the development of European charter services should focus on the airports at Shannon and Cork and on the regional airports. I would say to Aer Rianta and everybody involved that unless we co-ordinate our activities to attract these charter flights from European destinations to Cork and Shannon and unless we make clear that these inducements to Shannon no longer apply and state clearly that there will not be <Col N="21" /> further poaching, then our voices in Cork will continue to be heard on this issue.</P>
    <P>I also want to look at the bilateral arrangement in the context of Cork Airport as an international airport. While I continue to be critical of the fact that in winter and when it is raining passengers at Cork Airport get drenched by the time they get into the terminal building, it is quite inconceivable that over the years Aer Rianta has allowed a situation to develop where there is not even one air bridge available at Cork Airport to accommodate passengers. Does that send out a signal that we are interested in looking after passengers? I am quite concerned also that due to the dramatic increase in the number of passengers using this airport, people have been forced to park in a field a quarter of a mile from the terminal building and that they must encounter considerable difficulties in trying to get luggage into the terminal building in the rain. Suddenly everything is about to change at the same time, but it begs the question, &ldquo;Where does Cork Airport stand in the order of things?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stand behind the workers at Cork Airport. They would be foremost in my mind. I am confident that even under the present constrained arrangements, passenger numbers at Cork Airport will grow from 1.7 million to 2 million next year and that we will see this increase to 2.5 million over the next three years.</P>
    <P>The rate of growth in this area is alarming. It is also alarming that we will not be able to continue to serve these passengers by way of an extension to the terminal. The terminal can cater for in the region of one million passengers, yet 1.7 million passengers are routed through the terminal at present.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here? The blank reality is that Cork does not have a member on the board of Aer Rianta. That is something which should be rectified to make sure the regional emphasis is part and parcel of the board. As the third airport in this country, Cork will continue to be the third airport in the mindset of Aer Rianta and its board and will always be developed as such.</P>
    <P>We speak of transatlantic flights. We are told it is possible to get a charter company to fly to Cork Airport from the US. Earlier this year a serious effort was made and serious negotiations took place with a group in the United States so that a particular charter company could operate regular flights to Cork, but for some reason word got out and it was spiked. For some reason other airports in this country made contact with the same group and at the end of the day it did not happen for Cork. That is the type of thing about which we are talking &ndash; the selectivity, inequality and budget differential that exists. While that position exists between Shannon and Cork, talks with transatlantic charters will be spiked.</P>
    <P>Transatlantic flights into the Cork and Kerry region are a vital part of tourism in the south-west region. The runway at Cork Airport needs to be extended to cater for such a development. <Col N="22" /> The bottom line is that if one looks at the Aer Rianta plan, one will see it is not part of its operational programme to 2005 but that it is part of a programme to 2010. It strikes me that the horse may have bolted by 2010. That does not face the reality, the demand and the major opportunity which is there for the development of tourism in the south-west region through Cork Airport. I would say to Aer Rianta, and particularly to make the Minister mindful of it, that it is necessary to tackle the extension of that runway so that the opportunity exists for regular flights into Cork.</P>
    <P>The question is, &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo; There are people who will say Cork Airport should be totally privatised and that by privatising it, the necessary stimulus will be provided to accelerate the development of the airport. I am not in favour of that option. I and everybody connected with Aer Rianta know that the development of Cork Airport will be done in the context of the hind tit &ndash; it will be considered as the third airport which can grow at a snail's pace.</P>
    <P>I am of the belief that there should be a private-public partnership arrangement in Cork Airport. I know many of the workers would be fearful of this option. The workers have absolutely nothing to fear from that option because the bottom line is that if we had a public-private partnership in Cork, it would be totally geared towards the promotion of Cork Airport, it would ensure the airport would stand side by side with Dublin Airport further down the road and would outstrip developments in Shannon and instead of job losses, more jobs would be created in Cork Airport, with greater opportunities and better infrastructure in the south-west region in terms of the development of tourism and it would be in the best interest of all of us. I hope the voice of Cork will be heard by the board of Aer Rianta.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000. As an island nation, aviation is the most important means of access to Ireland from abroad and means of travel for Irish people travelling abroad. I welcome the fact that we now have a comprehensive Bill dealing with the independent regulation of the aviation industry.</P>
      <P>Primarily, I want to use this opportunity to speak, as other Deputies have, on behalf of Cork Airport. The Bill deals with Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports. I am pleased Government Deputies from Cork are coming into the House to promote the activities at Cork Airport. For too long perhaps the political emphasis and pressure came from the Shannon region in terms of airports outside Dublin. Perhaps that political pressure is moving south. I welcome that, it is not before time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> As I said, I want to use this opportunity to highlight issues in relation to Cork Airport and its vital role in the future development and prosperity of the south and, indeed, the south-west. The South West Regional Authority, since its establishment in 1994, has identified and continues to identify access as the major factor in the social and economic development of Cork county and surrounding areas. All forms of access must continue to be developed by the Government, whether road, rail, sea or telecommunications infrastructure as well as air transportation. If all these are invested in and developed, the southern region as a whole can continue to prosper and be a real alternative for investment to the Dublin area. That is what is needed. In the Government's national development plan, a very clear emphasis is put on the role of the south-west and Cork region as a counterbalance to the rapid development of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The growth in passenger numbers travelling through Cork Airport in recent years is testament to the huge number of people who will come into the region if provided with proper and consistent access. Cork international airport is one of the fastest growing regional airports in Europe. Passenger numbers have doubled in the past six years and continue to grow rapidly. As Deputy Batt O'Keeffe pointed out, between 1.6 million and 1.7 million passengers passed through Cork Airport this year and within the next three years it is estimated that 2.5 million passengers will pass through the airport.</P>
    <P>Against this background of growth and pressure on the airport to expand to cater for increasing demand, Aer Rianta's announcement last year of a £60 million investment package was welcomed by everybody in Cork. However, the stalling in relation to the implementation of this investment plan is very worrying. Very little has happened in relation to the construction necessary to get this expansion project under way. The only thing that has physically happened is the commencement of building for the new airport hotel in Cork, which is not even part of the £60 million package. The Minister of State does not need to be reminded that Cork Airport has a capacity of just one million passengers, therefore, it is currently operating at in excess of 50% above its capacity.</P>
    <P>The main Aer Rianta investment proposals &ndash; I will not go into them in too much detail because other Cork Deputies have done so &ndash; include a significant expansion of the airport terminal; the provision of air bridges to allow passengers to walk directly from their planes to a terminal so that there will no longer be the prehistoric situation of people having to walk in the lashing rain for 100 or 150 yards from an airplane to the airport terminal; the provision of increased parking spaces for planes and the provision of multi-storey car parking facilities for people leaving their cars at the airport over the weekend or for longer periods. As already pointed out, people must <Col N="24" /> park in a grass field as an overflow long-term car park at present. The provision of improved facilities and space for cargo traffic is also necessary and a priority in the Aer Rianta plans.</P>
    <P>These changes are a necessity, not a luxury, for Cork Airport if its status is to be brought into line with other international airports. We have now reached a crucial point in the history of air travel in the Cork region. The airport will be allowed either to continue as primarily a feeder airport to Dublin and react to increased passenger growth levels as they occur or it can fundamentally change its role and become an alternative national access point to Dublin and Shannon. The latter is the ambition we should all have, whether we come from Cork or Dublin, for the sake of both cities and regions. A Cork Airport consultative committee is now being set up, made up of a variety of concerned individuals, including politicians, to ensure that promises are kept on behalf of the Government and Aer Rianta and that our ambitions become a reality in the not too distant future.  </P>
    <P>Studies have shown that the catchment area for Cork Airport continues to expand into areas such as Kilkenny and Clonmel, as well as westward and eastward from Cork. This market share has been achieved with what can only be described as a relatively modest number of direct international destinations within Europe and an unsatisfactory level of internal services through Cork Airport. It is important to acknowledge the positive role Aer Rianta has played in continuing to attract an increasing level of direct European destinations, particularly at week ends, in flights out of Cork. However, it cannot continue to do this without the immediate expansion plans being put into action. One could say that Cork Airport, which has been given only a small marketing budget compared to Shannon, despite the fact that they had the same passenger numbers, has been a victim of its own success. Cork Airport cannot continue to grow unless the investment is put in place. When we hear worrying reports that Aer Rianta may have difficulty finding the money for this expansion, we must ask questions.</P>
    <P>Air transportation and aviation infrastructure should be no different from road infrastructure, rail infrastructure and the infrastructure put in place in ports throughout the country. It is about allowing people to move, whether on business, holiday or visiting friends. If necessary, the Government should provide direct funding to develop airports, both regional and international, just as is the case in relation to the road and rail infrastructure. There is no difference as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>On the lack of internal flights, at present it is not possible to fly from Cork to Shannon. If someone from the Cork region, which continues to grow, wishes to fly to the USA but does not wish to drive to Shannon and leave their car there, they must fly to Dublin, back to Shannon and then across the Atlantic. This means they must take two flights before they set off across <Col N="25" /> the Atlantic, which does not make sense. I do not think this treats people equally or attracts people equally to the Cork and south-west region?</P>
    <P>Cork is the second city of Ireland, yet from an airport point of view, it is not being given any importance. I welcome the plans for expansion outlined by Aer Rianta. They will solve many problems but I am sceptical they will be implemented in the timescale which has been pointed out. This is why so many Deputies are speaking on behalf of Cork Airport both on the Government and Opposition sides. We are all sceptical until we see the evidence. If one looks at the history of our aviation policy, one will see that Shannon and Dublin consistently receive priority and Cork Airport has been left behind in many cases. If it were not for the marketing skills and drive of the Aer Rianta staff at Cork Airport, it would have fallen even further behind.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the transatlantic routes and the fact that Cork Airport has been squeezed out in this area. Given that the USA is a popular destination for Irish people going on holiday, and particularly for American tourists coming to Ireland, it is unacceptable in modern Ireland that there are no direct flights from the USA to Cork Airport. I do not accept that the runway at the airport is not long enough, my information is that it is long enough for international transatlantic flights. I do not think the people of the south-west should have to put up with this inconvenience from a business or social point of view. This is about much more than just air access, it is about tourism revenue, economic development and social movement. People throughout the country, including the south and south-west region, should be entitled to this facility like people in Dublin and the Shannon area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to comment on this Bill which has been generally welcomed on all sides of the House. I will not add a dissenting voice in respect of the contributions which have been made on all sides.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say this is not a national policy in relation to air travel. We still await a national policy in this regard from the Government. The fact is we have an under-resourced regional airport structure and, despite the odd crumbs that may fall from the Cabinet table to regional airports in Galway, Waterford and so on, we lag far behind most EU countries in respect of internal domestic flights between one region of the country and another. The Bill makes no provision for this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the commission and its new powers in respect of landing charges and operations. This is a useful way in which to deal with such a public utility. This has also been used in other areas of public policy. However, I have a number of questions on the legislation to which I would be grateful for a reply from the Minister of State. Section 2 refers to &ldquo;airport user&rdquo; as meaning any person responsible for the carriage of passengers, mail or freight by air to <Col N="26" /> or from an airport. That is an entirely deficient definition of an airport user. There is no reference to the passenger in this. If one looks at sections 5 to 16 and the new commission which will be established, there is no consumer's voice in respect of the commission. The commission will operate in the role of a chief executive of a semi-State company in terms of establishing charges and putting in place an administrative structure. It is deficient in that the consumer's or passenger's voice will not be one of the commissioners. Section 16 allows for the appointment of up to three commissioners. The voice of the consumer &ndash; the passenger &ndash; should be included in a pool of contenders for one of these positions. I ask the Minister to reply to this proposal on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This House has a tendency to set up bodies to administer aspects of State policy but I often wonder if we give these boards the necessary resources. Section 12 refers to the staff of the commission. I hope the commission will be properly staffed and that a sufficient number of authorising officers are appointed to implement policy on the ground. I have too much experience of inadequately staffed bodies.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 27(3), which states that the commission shall account for the performance of its functions to a joint committee of the Oireachtas. It makes sense for the commission to come before the relevant committee annually to outline its work for a 12 month period. However, the legislation should be much more prescriptive in stating that the commissioners should come before a joint committee at least annually. Such a provision should be included on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>My problems begin with section 46. This section, which is neatly placed under the heading, &ldquo;Miscellaneous Amendments&rdquo;, ensures that if any civilian operation is to take place in a military aerodrome, such as Baldonnel in my own constituency, the Minister may, &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Defence, for the purpose of the licensing and regulation of aerodromes and the regulation of aeronautical safety standards at aerodromes, prescribe in regulations that sections 58(1) and 60, and such other provisions of this Act as specified in the regulations, shall apply to civil aviation operations at such aerodromes under the control of the Minister for Defence as may be specified in the regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence and his Department have a veto on all developments close to Baldonnel or any other military aerodrome. This is a wrong approach, particularly as the Government has not made up its mind regarding development at Baldonnel. Every so often during the past three years the Tánaiste has referred to her plans, if we can call them such, to develop Baldonnel but no decision has been taken at Cabinet regarding the aerodrome. Section 46 has been quietly stitched in at the end of this Bill giving extensive powers to the Minister for Defence and reinforc<Col N="27" /> ing the veto which he already has. As a member of South Dublin County Council, I am fed up receiving diktats from the Department of Defence in respect of any development at Baldonnel. The Department is now holding up the development of a major sports stadium, Eircom Park, because it disagrees with its location in the south-west of Dublin. I want to see this veto removed. It is time for the Government to state clearly its intentions with regard to Baldonnel. Is it to be developed as a commercial entity? Is an executive jet service to be provided? What is to be done with the airport? We have been asking these questions for the past three years but we have not been given answers. Section 46 is of no relevance to the Bill. I would like the Minister to explain its inclusion.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 49. However, the new penalty of £1,500 for air rage offences is not sufficient. We must increase the deterrents and I hope we will do so on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I endorse the comments of Deputy McGinley regarding regional airport development in the north-west. Unemployment in County Donegal is the highest in the country. It is impossible to get in or out of the region. Only one flight goes from Dublin to Derry and from Derry to Dublin every day. We need a proper regional airport policy. The Government does not have such a policy and this legislation will make very little difference to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of Deputies offering to speak in this debate is an indication of the importance of air transport. A large number of informative contributions were made in the Seanad and I am glad to hear the Minister undertake to consider seriously the contributions from all sides in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a commission with responsibility for five policy areas, the approval of airport and air traffic control charges; the approval of ground handling service providers at airports; the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland; the administration of the rules governing the allocation of take-off and landing slots at airports; and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators. It is appropriate, when there is such an upsurge in air travel in and out of Ireland, that such an imaginative Bill be introduced to regulate the aviation industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years Irish airports have been underfunded, none more so than Cork Airport. The terminal structure in Cork was intended to cater for a maximum of 1 million people. It now caters for 1.6 million and it is envisaged that in two years it will cater for 2.5 million. Cork Airport has been badly treated by Aer Rianta which has favoured Dublin and Shannon airports. Were it not for the work of the staff at Cork Airport the position would be even worse. The management of Cork Airport has lobbied internally for extra funding for the airport. I pay particular trib<Col N="28" /> ute to CAAB and its chairman, Donal Harris, for highlighting issues regarding Cork Airport. While a commitment to spend £60 million on developing Cork Airport over the next number of years is welcome, nothing tangible has been done. This is a cause of concern for the staff of the airport and for the wider community in Cork. The fact that Ireland is an island places huge importance on air travel and quality airports for the people arriving in the country. If regional development is to be encouraged, we must ensure that better facilities are available for air travellers and Cork Airport is suffering badly in this regard.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport has a larger marketing budget. Over the years, Cork Airport has not received equitable treatment in terms of marketing and funding from Aer Rianta and other agencies from which Shannon Airport can extract funds. This has put Cork Airport at a disadvantage. While the £60 million investment plan is welcome, it is not enough if regional imbalances are to be addressed. The capital city is bursting at the seams and there is traffic gridlock and a lack of quality public transport. It is a vibrant city, but it is beginning to stifle itself. I do not understand why more emphasis is not placed on developing greater facilities at airports such as Cork and Shannon.</P>
    <P>The national development plan will involve the expenditure of £40 billion over the next six years on developing the economy, infrastructure and other areas. The development of the road structure creates great opportunities for Shannon and Cork airports. For example, there is talk of a motorway or high quality dual carriageway from Cork to Dublin within six years and this would increase accessibility to Cork Airport. This is the type of project that should be considered rather than directing all the funding and development into the already congested area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We should be brave and take a policy decision to encourage air travel into Cork and Shannon airports. I am confident the national development plan will ensure a proper road structure is in place in a few years which will cater for people who wish to travel from Cork to other parts of the country. It does not make sense to fly people to Dublin, put them in taxis or buses to bring them to Heuston train station and then transport them down the country. We must open up the country and ensure that Cork Airport can cater for larger carriers.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to transatlantic flights and I have a major difficulty with the fact that there are no transatlantic flights to Cork Airport. Another speaker referred to the proposal made last year that a carrier would bring people from Boston to Cork Airport. This was reported in the newspaper and it was stated that Cork would benefit tremendously from it. However, something spiked it and my belief is that there is favouritism within the Aer Rianta management system towards Shannon and Dublin. This is to the detriment of Cork.</P>
    <P>Regarding inward investment, a quarter of all US investment in the European Union is located <Col N="29" /> in Ireland. If we want to continue to attract that type of investment in terms of high quality jobs and facilities, Ireland must be made more accessible from the United States. There should be direct flights from the east coast of America to Cork. There is no traffic congestion in Cork and it also has a large hinterland that could support industry, a quality port, universities and an institute of technology. There are IDA centres throughout Cork and the southern Munster region. The necessary infrastructure is already in place and the only difficulty is that people cannot get to it.</P>
    <P>For example, if one is travelling to Cork from New York, Washington or Boston, one must fly to Shannon and then on to Dublin. One must then either fly or get a train to Cork. This is unacceptable for business people and it is an area where the regional imbalances could be addressed. There is continual talk about the fact that the east coast is overcrowded, that too much funding is being given to it and that there is not enough investment in the regions. Making Cork accessible in areas where there is huge potential for more investment is an obvious way to address the imbalance. The United States should be targeted in that regard.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport has no air bridges and there are no parking facilities for aeroplanes or passengers' cars. These issues were neglected in the past and efforts are being made to address them now. The £60 million investment proposal over the next five years is intended to increase the terminal capacity to handle 2.5 million passengers per annum by 2003 and to facilitate further expansion thereafter to handle up to 5 million passengers per annum. If Cork Airport had a level playing pitch, it could reach those targets in advance of the timescale outlined by Aer Rianta with regard to the investment.</P>
    <P>The development of facilities must be expedited and there is concern in Cork that Aer Rianta at a national level has dragged its feet and that it has not been fully committed to the funding programme outlined in Cork last year. I have been in contact with the company and it told me in a letter that it is pushing ahead but issues arose in relation to planning and other matters. However, £60 million will not address the fundamental problems. It will address the problems that have arisen to date, but it will not cater for future developments.</P>
    <P>Given that 1.6 million passengers already use the airport and there is an expectation that this figure will increase to 2.5 million by 2003, a new report on Cork Airport should be commissioned now. It is certain that by the time the current plan has been implemented, it will be necessary to raise the issue in the House with the relevant Minister and to write to Aer Rianta seeking more funding because the airport is underfunded. This happened in Dublin. Work was done there but airline companies are not satisfied with the quality of service provided by Dublin Airport for passengers, although the airport was always the <Col N="30" /> favourite from the point of view of Aer Rianta. It is obvious that this will also happen in Cork in the future. While the short-term problems with regard to the passenger and cargo terminals, parking facilities for aircraft and air bridges are being addressed, a new study should be commissioned now to consider the future of Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>Regarding the extension of the runway, reference was made to the fact that aircraft from the United States cannot fly into Cork Airport. One hears that an aircraft fully laden with passengers, luggage and fuel cannot take off from Cork Airport and fly directly to the United States. If that is the case, the problem must be addressed. We cannot expect an airline to fly people from Cork Airport to Shannon, refuel its aeroplane and fly from there to the United States. There is little difference in the distance between Cork and Shannon airports and the east coast of the United States, but the need to take off from Cork, land in Shannon, refuel an aircraft and take off again for the United States could involve passengers having to sit on an aeroplane for an extra two hours.</P>
    <P>However, given the changing technology on aircraft which allows them to take off from shorter runways, I am not sure if this is an inhibiting factor in Cork Airport. I ask the Minister to clarify the position. If the largest aircraft that can land in Dublin and Shannon cannot land in Cork, an immediate extension of the runway must be included in the programme to upgrade Cork Airport. In the future, representatives in Cork Airport will approach charter companies to operate routes from the United States to Cork. However, there will always be a difficulty unless fully laden aircraft can take off from the airport and the routes are commercially viable. Shannon and Dublin airports will always be able to undermine Cork Airport's efforts in this area. I would welcome clarification from the Minister on this point. A person would be amazed to find that Cork Airport does not have a representative on the board. This shows the imbalance, the lack of a level playing pitch when it comes to Cork Airport's position in the pecking order with Aer Rianta. That was pointed out already with regard to investment but the fact that Cork Airport does not have a member on the board must be addressed immediately if we are to instil confidence in the people in Cork that Aer Rianta will deliver for Cork Airport. Surely, an obvious way to address that issue would be to have a person on the board from Cork Airport, to give it a voice.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the fact that Governments in the past did not support Cork Airport and that there was probably a bigger political lobby in Shannon. I have no doubt that is the case. Any mention of a downgrading of Shannon led to a massive outcry from public representatives of all persuasions and hues, some of which was quite hysterical at times. However, Shannon protected itself and fought a tough battle for a <Col N="31" /> long time. People will argue that since the restrictions on direct flights into Dublin were lifted, Shannon has been downgraded and there is now a complete imbalance with regard to tourism figures. The bed night numbers have gone up dramatically in Dublin and down along the western seaboard. I do not know whether that is because of the lifting of the direct flight restrictions but it should be examined.</P>
    <P>Equally, one can argue that it is madness that a person has to fly from Boston to land in Shannon, sit in a plane for three quarters of an hour and take off again and fly to Dublin. If we are to have direct flights, the plane should fly from Boston to Dublin or Boston to Shannon but do not ask that every second plane must land in Shannon. This would damage transatlantic air travel. If more development and funding was provided for Cork and Shannon airports, they could fight their own battles and have a strategic, coherent policy in place whereby Shannon Airport would target certain cities in the United States and Cork Airport would target others. The idea of one airport spending its budget undermining another airport within the same company is unpalatable and unacceptable. That has been happening. It was already referred to with regard to the undermining of Cork Airport in trying to attract a US carrier into Cork from the east coast.</P>
    <P>Cork has been successful in niche marketing with regard to flights to Paris and Amsterdam. I am confident that those will expand over time and become more regular, which is very beneficial. Cork Airport is also doing exceptionally well with flights to the south of Spain. This is an area which has taken off with regard to tourism figures. A great many people from the southern part of Munster or greater Munster and parts of south Leinster are using Cork Airport to fly to Spain because with improving road infrastructure, Cork Airport is becoming more accessible to more people. Rather than a person who is living in Kilkenny or Clonmel having to drive all the way to Dublin through traffic with the hassles involved, they can drive to a small airport, encountering no problems with traffic congestion in the city itself. The only problem concerns traffic congestion in the airport. While the £60 million investment is very welcome I predict that we will be back in two or three years time stating that funding will have to be reviewed and the whole plan will go back to the drawing board. We will bring forward another proposal for more funding to develop the airport in the years 2010 to 2020 because capacity will be at crisis point. Why not do this now? We should consider setting up a group that can project the demands that will be placed on Cork Airport and start developing it in a coherent, planned way. Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether US-bound air carriers can take off from Cork Airport on the length of runway currently available.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a speedy passage of the Bill <Col N="32" /> through the Houses. It is timely in view of all the comments made in this House and in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Balance is very important in aviation. It can make the difference between flying smoothly to one's destination or rocketing down to the ground. Balance is important in this debate as well. I am glad to contribute as a representative from the Shannon region. The Cork corner has been well represented here. The common thread running through what others have said and what I want to say is that we need both an aviation policy and a regional policy in which to sit this debate. That is part of the problem. We do not have clear policies about aviation and as a subtext to that, we do not have a regional policy in which these kinds of decisions can be made. That is why so many of us are taking the opportunity to use a Bill which is really about organisational and operational matters, to debate the broader issues in relation to airports, particularly the three international airports. These organisational and operational matters would be greatly improved if there was more of a balance between the three international airports in terms of both freight and passenger traffic. Therefore, it is important that we discuss regional policy when we discuss this issue. It should not be a battle between Cork and Shannon. I say that as a representative of the Shannon region and I will not try one-upmanship against Cork. Both areas need much more concentration in terms of national effort in order to counterbalance the development of the east coast, where a huge number of people use Dublin Airport, where far too many people are living, where far too much stress and pressure are put on the public transport and road systems and where there seems to be a very strong marketing push to add to that and to look for perhaps a second airport or a significant extension of the existing airport. If we had a proper regional and aviation policy, we would instead consider referring the business to both Shannon and Cork airports, which both have the capacity, perhaps not the physical capacity in the case of Cork Airport, but where there is an opportunity to develop both Shannon and Cork airports for the benefit of the country. It is not good for the east coast or for Dublin to have this overcrowding and constant drain on various capacities. There should be more emphasis both on Shannon and Cork airports in terms of achieving a proper balance. Many people must use Dublin Airport currently, although they are living much closer to either Shannon or Cork. This is partly because so many of the airlines are being attracted to Dublin and partly because of inadequate road structures and public transport.</P>
      <P>I am making an argument for an aviation policy and a regional policy that would redress that balance and try to establish much stronger markets in both Shannon and Cork, where as previous Deputies said, approximately 1.7 million passengers use both of those airports now, with Dublin far outstripping both of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> In arguing a case for Shannon, I say that Shannon is extremely important as an international airport, not just to the mid-west but also to the west, the midlands and part of the south-west. If the available figures were updated it would be seen that 30,000 to 40,000 jobs depend directly on Shannon Airport. That does not just include jobs in the airport itself but in industry, tourism and so on in the mid-west and other regions. It is essential to maintain the strength of the airport in order to retain those jobs and ensure they are viable. That is the reason people of all political persuasions and with various interests have come together to make sure Shannon Airport is not downgraded. I make no apology for that to people from Cork or elsewhere. I would encourage them to do likewise. The health and strength of an international airport are of great importance to a region. We in Shannon will continue to work together to ensure the airport is developed and strengthened and continues to be the instrument that it is for the growth of industry and tourism in the region.</P>
    <P>There is a need to work on marketing as mentioned by Deputy Kelleher and others. When people abroad buy airline tickets they are automatically directed to Dublin. Those who wish to visit the west end up flying into Dublin and making their way to the region into which they could have flown in the first place. The Shannon marketing company is working hard on this issue but it needs the backup of Government policy which should direct more and more tourists into areas other than Dublin, which is bursting at the seams. There are not enough hotels or bednights available in Dublin whereas such facilities in other areas are underutilised. Such a balance would be in the national interest.</P>
    <P>There is a need to improve the road and rail networks into Shannon and Cork. There are commitments in the national plan regarding links to the west and south-east but other bottlenecks must be addressed. The Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass is an obvious example. Anyone who has been caught in traffic there will know what I am talking about. In Limerick city work is ongoing on a fourth river crossing and a bypass on the eastern side of the Shannon. However, there is a need for a bypass on the Clare side of the Shannon linking the Dublin Road as it enters Limerick across to the Shannon Road. I read recently in <i>The Nenagh Guardian</i> that people in the Birdhill area in north Tipperary, which is close to Limerick, said approximately 200 cars pass along a narrow rural road every half an hour. Drivers avoid Limerick city by cutting across from the Dublin Road towards the Shannon-Ennis Road area. If there were a bypass it would not only solve problems for people in the area, it would make it easier for those living in Roscrea, Tullamore, Nenagh and Athlone to access Shannon Airport in a reasonable time. At present most people find it easier to go to Dublin because of the road network. There is a proposal to have a rail link between Limerick city and Shannon and that <Col N="34" /> should be looked at positively. It would help to bring tourists from the city to the airport.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by workers in Shannon Airport to raise some issues on the specifics of the Bill. As regards the regulation aspects of the commission, will it deal with Aer Rianta as a central body or will there be leverage for individual airports to make their case? There is a suspicion both in Cork and Shannon that Aer Rianta tends to be Dublin dominated. There is concern that decisions could be made in Aer Rianta that might be disadvantageous to either Cork or Shannon or to both. How will issues such as operating licences, designation of airports as co-ordinated airports under the relevant EU regulations, approval of ground handling service providers at airports, licensing and bonding of tour operators and travel agents and charges be dealt with in terms of the individual airport <i>vis-à-vis</i> the remit of Aer Rianta? Those working in Shannon Airport have pointed out that this is not made clear in the Bill and perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes mentioned air rage. This is dealt with in section 49. Having read newspaper reports today there is a need for a balance as regards the powers of the police and the airport authorities. The rights of the individual members of a GAA team were violated on the basis of the behaviour of some members of the team and not only the team but those with them, including the team doctor. They were in the terminal and were not allowed to board their flight. We must ensure that the rights of innocent people are protected and that must be balanced with the powers of the airport police. The individual whose behaviour is causing a problem should be dealt with in as tough a way as is necessary but we must ensure innocent people are not punished.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the general points in the Bill. However, the Government must concentrate on the issues of regional balance that are thrown up in any discussion on aviation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to contribute to this important debate. My colleagues have dealt with the specifics of the Bill and I will deal with those that affect the area I represent. Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair give a good service as Irish aircraft carriers. Aer Lingus is the main company. However, there is no doubt but that for the involvement of Ryanair airfares would be much higher than they are today. Tourism is one of our biggest industries and both airlines have contributed to its growth. However, there are serious problems as far as services at Dublin Airport are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stopover at Shannon must be re-examined. If we are to encourage more tourists from Canada and the US we must ensure they have the easiest possible access to this country, otherwise they will fly to London and remain there for some time instead of flying directly to Ireland. The Border region suffers as a result. When I first began to travel through Dublin Airport the number of <Col N="35" /> passengers was very small. One could arrive 15 minutes before the departure time, be sure of getting on the plane and arrive at one's destination on time. The situation has changed dramatically in recent years. One of the last times I travelled on a Friday morning it was virtually impossible to locate the other people who had the tickets and with whom I had planned to travel. It was not a joke trying to get to the ticket desk in time for our international flight. I know of others who had greater difficulty on flights to the UK, which is the most popular destination from Dublin Airport. Aer Rianta must deal with the situation as a matter of urgency to ensure that people do not have to queue for hours to fly out of the country. While those of us who live here do not have a choice, there is no doubt that tourists and business people will get fed up if the current situation is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The new changes leave a lot to be desired. Perhaps one reason for the problems is that people are appointed for political reasons rather than for their ability. I question how chairpersons and others are appointed and what role they play in how the system operates. Ryanair and others have made many demands about setting up a separate airport or an additional airport terminal. The Government must make every effort to ensure there is easier and quicker access to Dublin Airport so that people will not be frustrated and tourists and business people will not stop using it.</P>
    <P>Given that access is important, one must question the Government's commitment to develop the road and rail infrastructure to Dublin Airport. Almost four years ago the Taoiseach visited Monaghan and gave a guarantee that he would provide proper access from Monaghan to Dublin. Three bypasses were proposed but nothing has happened three and a half years later. One sod has not been dug. It is unacceptable at a time when the country is awash with funds that a Border area, which has suffered more than most over the past 30 years as a result of the Troubles, is being completely ignored. Consultants are studying the proposals for the three bypasses, which are being sent back and forth like yo-yos to the National Roads Authority. However, progress has not been made.</P>
    <P>There is a belief in Monaghan that an effort is being made to stymie this process so that funds which will be available from Europe over the next few years will be utilised somewhere else. Perhaps the Taoiseach would rather spend £1 billion on the national stadium. The people in my constituency are extremely frustrated that nothing is happening when money is supposed to be available. There is also no railway in the constituency. There is no doubt that efforts could be made to bring a railway into the southern part of it through Navan which would give easier access to the people. Other Members have spoken about this need in their regions. We want airports to be <Col N="36" /> managed properly and we want easier access to them.</P>
    <P>Access to some of the Northern ports is important for an area which has a 100 mile long border with Northern Ireland. There should be as much co-operation as possible between our Ministers and the Ministers of the new Northern Ireland Assembly. Some Members of this House will use Belfast Airport in the next two weeks to fly to Edinburgh. I hope under the new agreement there will be more co-operation between the Scottish Assembly, the Welsh Assembly and ourselves because we have a lot in common. I hope discussions will take place between our Ministers to ensure these links are opened up.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting Monaghan should have a regional airport but we must ensure that the airports available give the best possible service to the Border region. That region is among the lowest in terms of tourist figures and it is the least developed. The only way to encourage tourists into the area is to provide easy access to Dublin Airport or to Belfast Airport. I recently visited Canada on behalf of Monaghan County Council. It is totally unacceptable that it can take three or four flights to get from Canada to Northern Ireland and the Border region. There should be direct flights from Dublin to Toronto and vice versa. Unfortunately, Air Canada has a monopoly in Toronto. We sat in the airport in Toronto for more than 24 hours without being told why there was a delay. Monopolies are not good.</P>
    <P>The country has never had so much money. Areas, such as the Border region which has suffered more than any other region in the past 30 years of the Troubles, can no longer be ignored. The Government must ensure that air access is available for industry, tourism and the general well being of the community. That can only be done if Dublin Airport is completely restructured and if passengers get a proper service, which they are not getting at present.</P>
    <P>I always enjoy flying with Aer Lingus and, to a lesser extent, with Ryanair. However, the hassle of getting in and out of Dublin Airport is completely unacceptable. If it is unacceptable for us as citizens, it must be totally frustrating for tourists and if tourists are frustrated, the chances of them coming back a second time are extremely small. This cannot be ignored. The Celtic tiger is providing an opportunity to get things done. There is no point saying it is being planned or committees are being set up to deal with it because we want it done now.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which provides the basis for independent regulation of State airports, a sector which continues to play a critical part in the economy and supports growth in many <Col N="37" /> areas. The purpose of the Bill is to establish a regulatory body to be known as the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The new commission will have responsibility for five different areas of policy, namely, the approval of airport and air traffic control charges, the regulation of the ground handling markets at airports, the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland, the administration of the rules governing the allocation of take-off and landing slots at airports and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators. While I welcome that, the regulator will, at long last, create a level playing field in terms of the regional airports.</P>
      <P>I have spoken in this House on other aviation legislation and in support of my colleagues' views on regional airports and Cork Airport. I was delighted to be a member of the regional authorities support group, which comprises members from Cork Corporation, Cork County Council and Kerry County Council. Its purpose is to create a political grouping to lobby in the same successful way as the Shannon region has done. We intend to make a positive impact on the future of Cork Airport. For example, we are determined to ensure that transatlantic flights use the airport, which is vital to its long-term success. I demand that the Government facilitates these services.</P>
      <P>Over the years Cork Airport has developed by leaps and bounds. The new e-commerce technology park is hard to equal. It is a joint venture between Aer Rianta, ICC Bank and private business interests. Several thousand people are employed in high technology jobs in the park. The Great Southern Hotel group has, not before time, built a new hotel. It will be ready for business in January, but will not officially open until March. It will generate more business for the airport and the technology park and will help to make the airport the international airport it has become, and should have been a long time ago.</P>
      <P>I understand that approximately 640 hectares are available to the airport, which will allow for plenty of expansion. The new cargo handling facilities, located on a 40 acre site, are about to commence. More importantly, the airport has a dedicated staff committed to the people of the region and the development and success of the airport. I praise the manager, Joe O'Connor, especially for the leadership he has given his staff and the marketing manager, John Smith, who has done so much to attract new airlines to the airport in the face of incredible competition from other regional airports.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus charges £92 for a return flight from Cork to Dublin. That is airway robbery, especially when one can travel to the UK with Ryanair for as little as £5 or £10, depending on seat availability. I hope Mr. O'Leary of Ryanair will consider providing flights from Cork to Dublin to provide a more competitive fare of £40 to £50. I am sure this will increase passenger traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I praise the management of the airport for introducing new routes to Amsterdam &ndash; the ser<Col N="38" /> vice has been extended this week &ndash; Brussels and Paris. These are very successful. The management has coped well with the loss of duty free shopping, which was a big blow to all airports involved in passenger traffic. Sky shopping is doing well, but the loss of duty free sales in drink and tobacco has dampened the profits of Aer Rianta. However, increased passenger traffic and the ancillary businesses, in the business park, hotel and cargo will more than sustain the airport in the future.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport is like a zoo. It is expected to handle approximately 13 million passengers this year. Passengers from Cork face such a long walk to the arrivals terminal that many are ready to be taken away by stretcher, although there has been a change to this in the past few days and the walk is now considerably shorter. Immigration controls cause further delays. I am very disappointed with the way the security staff do their work. The car driver, who provides the airport with huge revenue and makes a big contribution to its viability, is the victim. He must park his car miles from the terminal building and pay high charges, despite the very limited access to the departures terminal and the impossibility of accessing the arrivals hall. I am unhappy with the way the airport conducts its business. Thank God Cork Airport does not face the same problems, where the management is friendly and personal and shows respect for the customer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently confirmed the extent of the investment in Cork Airport. The allocation of £60 million, which the Opposition claimed would not be provided, has been allocated and work has started. Much of it is completed and the remainder will continue over the next five years. The cargo facilities have been updated, the air-field and main runway have been overlaid with asphalt and widened by the provision of 7.5 metre shoulders on each side. This upgrading will last for 15 to 20 years, it cost £6 million and was completed last year, despite what the Opposition said on numerous occasions. An apron extension and a new taxi-way have been provided. An upgrading of the existing taxi-way is about to commence. It will cost £8 million and take approximately 18 months to complete. It will allow more aircraft to be parked on the runway.</P>
    <P>It is expected that 2.5 million passengers will use the airport by 2003. We hope the new extension and developments will allow for a growth in passenger numbers to five million. The new cargo facilities will cost several million pounds. The airport has one air-bridge, which means passengers should ideally travel on a dry day. I am pleased to note the provision for the construction of six air-bridges over the next five years. Provision is also made for the extension of the terminal buildings, and the construction of high rise and surface car parks. In addition, when completed, the entrance gateway &ndash; which a member of the Progressive Democrats likened to the entrance to a farm &ndash; will be magnificent.</P>
    <P>The layout of the airport is very user-friendly. <Col N="39" /> Passengers can get a parking spot in the knowledge that staff and officials will treat them properly. The airport is in the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Dennehy, who has done tremendous work to ensure that no part of the airport is sold to private ownership. I hope the Minster will tell her colleagues who have not yet seen the light to keep their hands off the airport. They will not sell it on our watch.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. A sign has been erected outside Cork Airport which reads, &ldquo;Cork Airport Strike &ndash; Not For Sale&rdquo; and I support that message which should be strongly conveyed to my Government colleagues. When Cork Airport sought funding at a time when it was struggling slightly, very few offers were received from the private sector. The airport is now a huge success by anyone's standards and everyone seems to want a slice of the action. I am aware that the Government is pursuing a public-private partnership policy but I believe Cork Airport will continue to do well with its existing programmes and staff complement.</P>
      <P>One of the mid-west Deputies offered us advice this morning to the effect that we should organise ourselves along the lines of the mid-western lobby on Shannon Airport and I agree with that. It is imperative that politicians work together on these matters. The Cork Airport support group is co-ordinated by the south-west regional authority and I, like Deputy O'Flynn, am happy to be a member of the group.</P>
      <P>I have worked closely over the years with staff at Cork Airport, which is located a quarter of a mile from my home. The majority of workers in the airport are constituents of mine but, even if they were not, I would still be working on their behalf in the context of the airport being a regional facility. The airport is assisting the development of the entire south-west region and, while I wish the people in the mid-west luck with their efforts, we will be seeking a level playing pitch. That has not happened and I hope there will be equality of opportunity in this area, be it in the form of a promotional company such as the one established in Limerick, the additional funding provided for Shannon Airport or the directives that people must fly into Shannon. These measures are, however, very artificial. Shannon Airport is essential to the survival of the mid-west but when artificial measures are introduced, they pose certain threats.</P>
      <P>In contrast to Shannon, Cork Airport has developed very naturally in the absence of any support. It has never received any hand-outs and has had to battle for any funding it received. The airport's success has caused some difficulties in that the airport is trying to keep pace with its growing number of customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers have, understandably, been parochial in their contributions and have highlighted the <Col N="40" /> needs of their own areas. While I am doing the same, I feel we should also look at the national picture. The Bill is critically important in this context. Aviation is more important to Ireland than almost all other European countries, with the exception of the UK. As an island, we have faced certain handicaps. The EU has been committed to the provision of funding for shipping ports and &ndash; to a lesser extent &ndash; airports. Sea ports have received huge levels of EU assistance but we did not avail of the optimum potential EU funding available for our airports. We were far too modest. Some £60 million has been sanctioned for developments at Cork Airport but even that is too modest. We must consider the current increases in air traffic and projected figures for 20 years' time. Our current programmes will not keep pace at Shannon, Dublin or Cork. We should be far more far-sighted and optimistic about the future.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill has been used as an opportunity to take side swipes at various projects. I want to refer for a moment to Baldonnel Airport. There has been a repeated suggestion that there is a hidden agenda in regard to the airport which is connected to the prevention of a local soccer stadium being built. Two local rugby clubs in Cork which play in Musgrave Park applied for a major new floodlighting programme three years ago. The aviation authority objected to the development on the very solid ground that the floodlighting could cause difficulties for pilots and result in confusion. The argument in regard to Baldonnel has not been plucked out of the air to make things awkward for the FAI.</P>
    <P>The history of our airports' development has fluctuated according to what Government or Minister was in office. Some Ministers appear to be more enthusiastic than others in regard to the future of aviation and the development of airports. Since Cork Airport was built, great courtesy and hospitality have been extended to all Ministers who have visited or had an involvement in the airport. I recall only one incident in 1984 when airport workers actually booed a Minister at their annual dinner because he told them that as Cork was only the second largest city in the country, it was not entitled to funding for an airport extension. It is very difficult, in light of this, to stomach the criticism from Cork Fine Gael Deputies to the effect that the £60 million is not being provided quickly enough or that it is insufficient. When one examines the record, that seems very hypocritical. I am prepared to make allowances for financial hardships in the past but the former Minister's approach in 1984 proved very detrimental to the development of Cork Airport and airports generally. There did not seem to be a will to improve airports or further their development. By contrast, we now have a Minister who is happy to fight for funding for Cork Airport and others.</P>
    <P>I can understand why artificial measures are being taken in regard to Shannon. However, the insistence that international travellers must fly to <Col N="41" /> two airports seems to be totally unrealistic. The common aviation area has been under discussion for a long time and I understand the hesitation to participate fully in this or to open up the airways. That is probably intended to protect Shannon. Shannon should be assisted but I do not believe the answer lies in the diversion of unwilling passengers to the airport. Perhaps if the airport were made more attractive, people would want to go there.</P>
    <P>We should have transatlantic flights into Cork; assurances have been received from the airport manager, technical staff and sales people that that would be feasible. It is more than coincidental that attempts in this regard were shanghaied by other airports. That was possible because of the existence of an artificial promotional body for Shannon Airport for the past 30 years which was able to put its finger into the pie.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy O'Flynn in calling on Aer Lingus to give Cork Airport a fair deal. At a time when fares are decreasing rapidly worldwide, it still costs £100 to get from Cork to Dublin. As Deputy O'Flynn stated, that is airway robbery and I ask Aer Lingus to review its position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a few points on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, in response to the debate. I thank Members who have contributed to the debate and who have clearly put much time and effort into their contributions. However, while Deputies raised issues of concern to the aviation sector and to the people they represent, much of the discussion was outside the strict scope and purpose of the Bill, which is to provide for economic regulation in the area of airport charges and a number of other areas currently under the remit of the Department relating to market access and licensing procedures.</P>
      <P>During the debate a broad range of issues was raised, including investment in airports, both State and regional, and specific issues relating to the future expansion of individual regional airports, privatisation of State owned companies, environmental issues, helicopter rescue services, pension schemes for Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus staff and air accident investigation. While these issues are relevant to a general debate on aviation, and while the Minister very much appreciates the level of interest which the House has shown in examining the issues relevant to the sector, they do not come within the very specific intentions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced in the House in June the Minister laid out clearly what was being proposed. In summary, it was explained that against the background of the liberalisation of the aviation market, the loss of duty free revenues, the very significant requirement for capital expenditure and the historic charging structure, the Government gave approval for the introduction of a fresh, independent approach to the issue of charges. The reasons for adding the remaining <Col N="42" /> regulatory functions &ndash; ground handling, air carrier licensing, etc. &ndash; to the regulator's brief were also outlined. While I do not wish to restate the wide range of issues covered in the introductory statement on Second Stage, I take the opportunity to touch on some of the larger issues raised during Second Stage.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government proposals in relation to the Aer Lingus IPO are in the public domain, and the issues raised here, including pensions, are best left to the debate on the Aer Lingus Bill which will shortly be brought back to the House. Regarding industrial relations, there have been very positive developments in recent days in all but one of the various disputes which have arisen and progress is continuing to be made either at local level or under the auspices of the State's industrial relations machinery. In the dispute involving the catering staff, while the Labour Court recommendations have not found favour with the group, and a one day stoppage was organised for today, I hope, as we all hope, that a solution to the outstanding issues will be found in the context of the Labour Court's continued involvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State give way to allow me ask a question? The Minister, during the debate, gave a commitment that the pensions issue would be resolved before she proceeded with the Aer Lingus Bill. Has that now changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accurately respond to the Deputy on that question, but I will ensure he receives a response before the end of the day.</P>
      <P>The House is aware that a report was commissioned some time ago to address the future options of Aer Rianta. My senior colleague has already indicated to the House that deliberations as to the best option have not yet reached finality, and that is still the position. However, in the interim the Bill provides the company with a statutory regulator who is being given a very comprehensive brief in relation to the needs and requirements of a modern airport authority.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, regional airports are private companies, so my Department's remit is somewhat constrained as to their operation. However, I remind the House that the support of regional airports is an express element of the programme for Government. The State has invested significantly in regional airports in recent years through the provision of marketing funds and capital grants, and more recently through the national development plan under which a total of £11 million has been allocated to the regions in which the airports are located. We are also dealing with the issue of air access to the regions through the public service obligations procedures which are being administered by the Department of Public Enterprise. The tenders which have been received on foot of the PSO process are being evaluated.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I welcome the Bill as it allows the Minister to increase the annual capital grant to the Irish Film Board. We all recognise that the board together with the tax incentives &ndash; section 481 &ndash; remain the linchpins of the film industry in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of issues surrounding the development of the Irish Film Board which are crucial and which must be dealt with immediately by the Minister. In her contribution she outlined some of the initiatives she proposes, and I will pose further questions in my contribution. The Minister committed herself to implementing the 1999 Kilkenny report in full. It said the capital budget of the Irish Film Board should be doubled in two to three years. The Bill allows the Minister to do that, but the question arises as to whether she will do so. In the Estimates the Minister will have the opportunity to show exactly what she <Col N="44" /> proposes to provide for the board for 2001, and in her reply to Second Stage I would like her to outline her proposals for funding the board over the next two years, as she did not specifically refer to this in her contribution.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister said she would like to see the income of the board doubled over four to five years. That timescale is much too long given the needs of the industry. I suggest the income of the board should be doubled over the next one to two years. There is some confusion. Therefore, there is a need for the Minister and her officials to clarify the position in regard to the funding of the Film Board, the administrative costs, the development costs and the capital costs.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny report made a number of recommendations on the role and responsibility of the Irish Film Board <i>vis-à-vis</i> other State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and RTE and suggested its role should be greatly enhanced. The Minister referred to this in her contribution on Second Stage, but she must clarify it further. There is no point in stating it here on Second Stage, what people need to know is what action she is prepared to take. While I welcome the increased funding provided under the Bill, the Minister must be more specific about the role she plans for the Irish Film Board to place it on a stronger strategic footing in the development of the industry. When will the process commence? What is her strategy and what programme is in place to do that?</P>
    <P>I understand there are only six people on the staff of the Irish Film Board. If we hope to build a dynamic film industry &ndash; the Minister said she is prepared to give new responsibilities to the Irish Film Board and that it will have a developmental role and so on &ndash; surely that involves staffing, a matter to which the Minister has not referred. Perhaps her officials will ask her to clarify that issue when replying.</P>
    <P>During the debate on last year's Finance Bill I referred at length to the film industry. The Minister for Finance responded by accepting my amendment on an aspect of section 481. Section 481 cannot be divorced from the future of the Film Board because every film in which the board invests derives finance from that section. The industry is in good condition. This is due to the sterling exchange rate which has artificially boosted the levels of production in Ireland. This could be in the short term. In February when I made these points on the Finance Bill the film industry was facing increasing competition, particularly from Great Britain which is pouring vast amounts of lottery funds into the film industry. It is backing up schemes and providing tax incentives for the export of television programmes, animation production and so on. In Los Angeles the state is providing incentives to hold some of its big films in Los Angeles and at home in Hollywood. We are fortunate to have that exchange rate advantage at this time but we must always be wary and vigilant of the buoyancy which has taken place. There had been a lull for <Col N="45" /> some time, the market appears to be buoyant once more but it may not last forever. That is why is it important that all the recommendations of the Kilkenny report are implemented and that some of the actions pointed out by the Minister are put in place immediately.</P>
    <P>This is the right time for the Minister to give her views on the tax incentives. She committed the Government to implement the Kilkenny report in full. Three recommendations in this report of major significance have still not been implemented nor has the Minister given any indication in her Second Stage speech or over the past 12 months of when she intends to implement them. The level of tax relief at the marginal rate permitted for personal investors must be set at 100% for projects with budgets below £4 million. A budget of £4 million is the average for most Irish originated feature films. It could remain at 80% for films with budgets of more than £4 million. The restoration of 100% relief is important. The 80% relief should be reviewed upwards in light of changes in conditions such as the lowering of the marginal rates of personal taxation. The first recommendation is the most important at this time, along with a possible review of the 80% relief in view of the changes in personal taxation. Also, investors must be permitted to opt to invest £50,000 in the first year. This would mean they would not be entitled to make a further investment in the second year but would allow people to frontload a sum of £25,000. A combination of all three recommendations would ensure the industry would meet the targets for growth set out in the report. I look forward with interest to the proposals in the budget and Finance Bill relating to the Film Board. The Minister has an opportunity to enhance what she said in her Second Stage speech with action in the budget, in the Estimates and in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to look briefly at the phenomenal success of the Film Board over the past ten years. The level of production was undreamt of ten years ago. It has succeeded in fostering talent and creativity and has produced six to eight films per year. Those working in the Film Board deserve recognition for their commitment. Too often the Film Board has been placed in the role of minor partner, propping up productions driven by the BBC, Channel 4 or agents of the US studios. The Minister mentioned that we should recognise our cultural expression but the big question is editorial control. If one is the minor partner how can one have editorial control? That is an issue about which we must be wary.</P>
    <P>The board's function should be not only to foster talent and creativity but also to foster an entrepreneurial spirit and flair. It is no longer good enough to produce films. We must have a strong marketing arm and look at distribution. There are other aspects of film production which the board must consider. Bringing the Screen Commission under the remit of the board and having them work closer together will help. It does not make sense for the Film Board to have <Col N="46" /> half a page in an international film magazine and the Screen Commission to have another half a page. That has happened. Both can now work together to promote Ireland as an attractive destination for film production. It is also important that the commission and the Film Board work closely with the Northern Ireland Screen Commission. The Minister of State might refer to this issue in his reply.</P>

      <P>There are 12 committees or groups in existence in my Department which involve other Departments of State. A senior officials group on European affairs has been established to support the work of the Cabinet committee on European affairs. It comprises senior officials of key Departments with a policy role in EU issues. The role of the group is to monitor major EU issues and prepare the agenda and the policy papers required for consideration by the Cabinet committee on European affairs. The senior officials group has met eight times since the beginning of the year. The committee will continue to meet as necessary.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group on the implementation of the Government's action plan for the information society is headed by my Department. This group is chaired by an assistant secretary and representation on the group is at assistant secretary level. The function of the group is to progress and co-ordinate the implementation of the Government's action plan for the information society. The group meets every few months and will be in existence for the duration of the action plan. There is no ministerial involvement in the committee.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group on access has been established to devise a strategy to implement the recommendations of the report IT Access for All published by the Information Society Commission. The group is chaired by an assistant principal and representation is mainly at that level. The group meets as required and will continue to operate until an access strategy has been devised for consideration by Government. The last meeting was held in June. There is no ministerial involvement in the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> The interdepartmental strategy group on employment and unemployment is comprised exclusively of officials from relevant Departments and FÁS. On average, the group meets every three months. It is intended that it will continue in existence for at least the duration of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The liaison committee on MediaLab Europe and Digital Media District Limited is comprised of representatives from relevant Departments and State agencies. To date, the committee has held two meetings, the last one being held on 5 November. It is envisaged that the committee will continue in existence until MLE and the digital media village have been developed in line with the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>The IFSC clearing house group is chaired by my Department with representatives of the financial services industry, together with representatives of the Departments of Finance, Public Enterprise and Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The group generally meets every two months. There is no time limit on the existence of the group.</P>
    <P>The IFSC public sector group is chaired by a representative of my Department. It includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Public Enterprise, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science, the Environment and Local Government, the Marine and Natural Resources and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. There are also representatives of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the Central Bank and IDA Ireland. The group meets on average every three months. There is no time limit on the existence of the group.</P>
    <P>The cross-departmental team on infrastructural development and public private partnership is led by my Department, with representatives of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, Public Enterprise, the Environment and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General. The general purpose of the committee is to oversee the delivery of key infrastructure in the context of the national development plan. It has met on 11 occasions to date. Meetings of the committee and team are usually held every four to six weeks and the last meeting was held on 10 October. There is no time limit on the life of the Cabinet sub-committee or the cross-departmental team.</P>
    <P>A project steering group which oversees the development of the Sports Campus Ireland project is chaired by my Department. The project is funded from my Department's Vote for this year but, now that it is off the ground, responsibility will be transferred to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation from 2001. The group comprises officials from my Department, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works and Campus and Stadium Ireland <Col N="48" /> Development limited. There is no ministerial involvement in the project steering group. The steering group first met on 25 September and will remain in existence for the duration of the Sports Campus Ireland project, which is due to be completed in 2005.</P>
    <P>The SMI implementation group was established by the Government in July 1997 with a mandate to drive the reform process forward within the Civil Service. The group is chaired by Mr. Dermot McCarthy, Secretary General to the Government and comprises the secretaries general of all Departments. The group meets on a monthly basis; the last meeting was held on 4 October 2000. There is no ministerial involvement in the group and there is no time limit on the existence of the group.</P>
    <P>The steering committee on the OECD review was set up to oversee participation in the OECD country review of regulatory reform. This steering committee is chaired by an assistant secretary from my Department. It is comprised exclusively of officials from relevant Departments and Forfás. There is no ministerial involvement in the committee. It has met eight times and will finish its work at the end of the review process which is expected to be in March 2001.</P>
    <P>A central review mechanism has been established in accordance with the monitoring arrangements set out in section 5.3 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Its task is &ldquo;to identify the appropriate arrangements to oversee the implementation of the four Operational Frameworks in the Agreement, to assess progress, and to address the strategic issues arising in order to review and monitor the operation of the Programme&rdquo;. It comprises representatives from all the relevant Departments as well as the social partners. The group meets once a quarter and the last meeting was held at the end of July. There is no ministerial involvement but I chair one meeting in the year which is also attended by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. The central review mechanism will remain in place until the PPF expires at the end of 2002.</P>

The SMI implementation group is in existence since July 1997. The Sports Campus Ireland project steering group is a new group.</P>
      <P>The social inclusion group is a Cabinet sub-committee which I chair. It includes representatives of the Ministers for Education and Science, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Finance.

      <P>I would also like to ask the Taoiseach about the central review mechanism group responsible for identifying the 25 areas of urban and rural deprivation, which has been promised by him many times.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy more directly, the work over the last 18 months or so has been to get Campus Ireland up and running, to get the project in place, to get support for it at Government, to get the funding mechanisms in <Col N="50" /> place, to locate a suitable site, to get the feasibility study completed and to get all the other aspects in place. That is now done. A board with its own staff and offices has been set up in Blanchardstown. The first phase, the aquatic centre, which has to be built in time for the Special Olympics, is out to tender. The other phases will move forward next year and thereafter. The preparatory work has been completed and all the arguments have been made. We tend to argue about projects which, years later, everyone agrees are great. I have been around so long that I heard all the things about the Royal Hospital and the Financial Services Centre, which was going to be a brass plate, and yet people were queuing up to be at the opening. It is the same old story. That has moved on.</P>
      <P>On the 25 areas, that is being done in conjunction with the social partnership. I am subject to correction on this and will inform Deputies if I am wrong but I understand they are taking the 25 areas which are most economically deprived, based on statistical facts. They will not get into any discussions. Whichever areas emerge as the most deprived from that review based on statistical, economic and social factors, they will take those areas. I think they probably have done that but I will check that for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying he has no personal involvement in the preparation of that list of 25 areas? Is it being done under the auspices of his Department or the social partnership with a hands off approach being taken by the Taoiseach?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum certainly came before the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and the decision was that rather than have any argument about what areas should be taken, because it came from a suggestion in the PPF the 25 most deprived areas should be the ones allocated. I think they have done that but I will check it for the Deputy.</P>

The Taoiseach <Col N="52" /> has not explained, other than to say it needed his hand, why it has been moved given that the committee organising it is chaired by a former Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach. Will the Minister, Deputy McDaid, perhaps change that chair so that it will be someone who has an association with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The functions, powers and duties of the Attorney General are found in Article 30 of the Constitution, in legislation, principally the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, in constitutional convention and in judicial decision.</P>
      <P>Article 30 provides that the Attorney General is the adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion. This includes advice to the Government, Ministers and the Departments or offices which they head. The Attorney General acts as lawyer for the State in virtually all civil litigation in which the State or its officers in an official capacity are parties.</P>
      <P>Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, the Attorney General has responsibility for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman, now the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, charities, escheated estates and the assertion or protection of public rights. The Attorney General retains certain prosecution functions, for example, under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978, and has functions under the Extradition Acts, 1965 to 1994. He also has functions under the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975 in relation to the Law Reform Commission. The Attorney General also has functions in relation to legislative programming and is a member of the Government legislation committee and in relation to the Attorney General's scheme, a non-statutory scheme under which certain legal proceedings not covered by legal aid can be funded.</P>
      <P>There have been organisational developments in relation to certain functions currently handled by the Attorney General. They include the decision to transfer the criminal division of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and responsibility for the State solicitor service from the Attorney General to the DPP and the proposals published in the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2000, in relation to the management of claims against the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans to review the role, functions or duties of the Attorney General. I am satisfied that the web page of the Office of the Attorney <Col N="54" /> General conveys the role and duties of the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for comprehensively outlining the functions of the Attorney General. Will he agree that the functions could, broadly speaking, be divided into two categories, on the one hand legal adviser to the Government and defender of the public interest on the other? If he accepts this broad division of responsibilities, in which capacity was the current Attorney General speaking when, as the putative president of the putative radical party, he declared that he would like to see income tax rates of 16% and 33%? Was that a public interest function or was it a legal advice to the Government function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question is correct. The Attorney General is the representative of the public in all legal transactions and proceedings and in the enforcement of law and the assertion or protection of public rights. The Attorney General defends the constitutionality of Bills referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. The Deputy will be familiar with his role in his capacity as Attorney General and what he is entitled to do outside that role when he makes speeches which are not relevant to his position as Attorney General. In the speech to which the Deputy referred, the Attorney General made it clear that he was not speaking in his capacity as Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the same person signalled that he was appointed on his own merits and not on the nomination of the present leader of the Progressive Democrats, does the Taoiseach believe it helpful for the cohesion of the Government that the current Attorney General, as nominated by him and appointed by the President of the Republic, was attempting to become the executive president of the party currently led by the Tánaiste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know nor do I ask the Attorney General what he does outside his role as Attorney General. I am not responsible for him outside that role. He is free in a democracy to speak when he wishes and I am sure he will do so on occasions on issues outside his role as Attorney General. He follows a distinguished line of people who have done so in the past. On six occasions since the foundation of the State, Attorneys General were Members of the House. These people spoke on many issues outside their role as Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past the Attorney General was a very distinguished Member of the House. He now has another eminent role in which he is doing an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="55" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the legal role the Attorney General provides and having regard to his responsibility as defender of the public interest, does the Taoiseach see any merit in making available to the public legal advice of a public general nature which the Attorney General may give from time to time as distinct from legal advice in relation to specific cases? In order for him to enhance his responsibility as defender of the public interest where he gives legal advice in relation to constitutional interpretations of a generic nature rather than of a specific kind, and not related to any particular case, does the Taoiseach see any organic development in the potential for fusing in a progressive way the role of legal adviser to the Government on the one hand and defender of the public interest on the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what the Deputy said recently outside and also in this House. The State must be able to deal with legal matters in a confidential manner. In most instances the Attorney General acts when the State is defending a case. Government Ministers, Departments and agencies must be able to rely on the confidentiality of the legal advice when putting forward proposals involving competing third party interests. These interests must be protected. Attorneys General case law will show that this is not just a convention but a matter of governance.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's question as to whether legal advice could be made available to the public in some instances, I recently inquired about this issue. The point was made to me that there have been examples of this. In a non-legal sense, because I am not a lawyer, I would feel more comfortable if the advice was made available where the State is not involved in defending an issue and it is just a matter of providing legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be happy to see it published&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, but this has not been the practice. However, it would be more comfortable because one has to regularly defend oneself when the case is very clearcut. There are examples of people trying to share the advice. We did this in an all-party context in relation to the Amsterdam Treaty. In many instances it is not an adversarial issue, it is straightforward advice. It often appears that people give conflicting advice but the Government of the day must deal with that issue. I recall instances when I could not see the merit in keeping the advice a secret. This is not the preferred option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to contemplate change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would consider the issue. However, there may be legal arguments involved. I have attempted to deal with this difficult issue, not just in my present position but as Minister for <Col N="56" /> Finance, with which the Deputy will be familiar. In that case, if one could use the advice, it would help the argument. Perhaps sometimes we are too secretive in relation to issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>In my answer to parliamentary questions on this subject on 5 October 2000, I stated that at present only those Garda stations which took part in the pilot trials of electronic recording have facilities for audio-video recording Garda interviews with detained persons. There are six such stations &ndash; Tallaght, the Bridewell in Cork, the Bridewell in Dublin, Portlaoise, Henry Street in Limerick and Mill Street in Galway.</P>
      <P>In July last year the Government decided that electronic recording should be introduced nationwide. It is envisaged that facilities for audio-video recording will be installed in approximately 150 Garda stations and that more than 300 interview rooms in these stations will need to be refurbished and fitted out to facilitate the audio-video equipment needed. Tenders were received in October for the supply of the specialised audio-video recording equipment needed. Completion of the evaluation of the tenders received for the specialised recording equipment and placing a contract with a supplier are scheduled for early next month. Delivery and installation of the equipment should commence in the first quarter of next year by which time I would expect that up to 130 interview rooms will have been refurbished and suitably fitted out.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I am fully satisfied that the Garda authorities are progressing the practical steps involved with the necessary urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the information given by the Minister to the House, is he aware that ten days ago, at a Garda conference on policing and human rights held in Dublin Castle, the Attorney General accused the Garda of foot-dragging in providing video recording facilities? Does the Minister agree or disagree with the view expressed by the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks of the Attorney General must be placed in context. I understand that in response to a contribution made on the day in question, the Attorney General stated it was his view that there had been foot-dragging and a failure of will, but he ascribed this lengthy delay to many different Administrations since the need for such recording facilities was accepted. My understanding of the position is that he was not making the point that individual members of An Garda Síochána were guilty of foot-dragging or failure of will and he does not hold that opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost 25 years since Barra Ó Briain reported on this matter and it is many years since the report of the Martin committee on this matter. It is 16 years since the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, was introduced, which made provision for <Col N="64" /> the recording of interviews with accused persons. All the neighbouring jurisdictions on these islands which have similar legal regimes have instituted such a system of recording. I am pleased that, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a member of the Government, I have proceeded to put in place this necessary measure after 25 years.</P>

      <P>He may be the future Taoiseach, one never knows, stranger things have happened. Does the Minister accept that the Attorney General stated there was foot-dragging and a lack of will to carry out this reform? Does he agree with that and, if not, why has he not made a public statement dissociating himself from it? If the Attorney General was misquoted, he was misquoted in every newspaper in the land. Why has the Attorney General not corrected the misstatement, if it be so? Considering that the Minister announced funding of £7.2 million in February of this year, as recorded in the <i>Sunday Business Post </i> of 20 February, to carry out the work of installing audiovisual equipment in all the Garda stations that he mentioned, why has this work not been done? How much of the £7.2 million will be expended this year or is he becoming simply a Minister for announcements? Finally, in relation to cases pending in general, is he confident that the lack of such equipment will not result in convictions that have been achieved in the past being quashed? </P>

      <P>To take the last point first, the Judges' Rules in the taking of any statement must be observed. We have taken a long time to come to the stage where audio-video recording equipment is to be installed in our Garda stations. The Government, as I stated, was doing that nearly a quarter of a century after Barra Ó Briain's report. The Deputy is well acquainted with the Attorney General and he and members of the Garda Síochána are well aware that throughout his career as a politician and a barrister, he has always held the force in high esteem. I do not believe there was ever an occasion when the present Attorney General gratuitously criticised either the force in general or individual members of it &ndash; of that I am quite satisfied. With regard to the delay, as Deputy Howlin describes it, in implementing a measure which the Government announced last year &ndash; he served in Government himself, which could have taken the step and did not&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are 300 interview rooms to be refurbished and fitted out, which will include ventilation, sound-proofing and so on, at <Col N="65" /> approximately 150 stations. A great deal of practical work has to be done. Tenders have to be invited and vetted for the required special equipment and almost the entire membership of the Garda Síochána has to be properly trained. The Deputy appreciates that this takes time to organise. However, I am happy that progress is being made and that we are shortly to see this matter resolved after more than a quarter of a century.</P>

Could the Minister tell the House how many members of the Garda Síochána to date have been trained in the use of this equipment? Would the Minister not acknowledge that if a Government decision was made in July 1999 to commence to provide for the video recording of people being questioned in Garda stations, by now it should be up and running and it should not simply be the pilot schemes continuing in operation? Would the Minister tell the House by what date he projects video recording equipment will be installed in the number of stations referred to and be in use? </P>

On what Deputy Shatter perceives to be a delay in implementing a decision, a decision was taken a decade or more ago that the Land <Col N="66" /> Registry should be turned into a semi-State agency.

      <P>The person referred to failed to return to the Central Mental Hospital on 15 July 2000 from a period of temporary release granted as part of a programme of phased releases as recommended by an expert advisory committee to which I shall refer later. As is normal practice in all cases where a person fails to return on time from a period of temporary release, he was deemed to be unlawfully at large and the Garda was informed and asked to search for and return him to the Central Mental Hospital. It, in turn, sought the assistance of the police authorities in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, where he was apprehended shortly afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, he was subsequently released by the UK authorities following an examination by psychiatrists who found that he did not suffer from a psychiatric condition warranting his detention under English law. He could not, therefore, be returned to this jurisdiction as the relevant legislation, Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act, 1965, allows only for warrants for accused or convicted persons to be executed and the person concerned did not fall into this category. In this jurisdiction his failure to return from temporary release is a summary offence of being unlawfully at large for which there is no legislative provision to extradite from another country. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that in February 1991 the Supreme Court found that the &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; verdict is, in effect, a special verdict of acquittal but that the statute which permits the special verdict, the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883, requires that the former accused be detained until such time as the Executive is satisfied that, having <Col N="68" /> regard to the mental health of the accused it is, for both public and private considerations, safe to release him. The court also ruled that a person found not guilty by reason of insanity may apply to the Executive, in the person of the Government or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for his release on the grounds that he is no longer suffering from a mental disorder warranting his continued detention in the public or private interest. The Executive must then inquire into all the circumstances using fair and constitutional procedures. To enable the Minister to carry out this function, an advisory committee procedure, comprising a senior counsel, consultant psychiatrist and general practitioner, was established to review these applications.</P>
    <P>This person's detention had, since 1991, been reviewed on no fewer than six occasions by independent advisory committees, each consisting of a senior counsel, consultant psychiatrist and general practitioner chosen for their expertise and knowledge in this area. An advisory committee had last reviewed his case in May 1999 following which a revised parole programme incorporating a phased increase in work parole, group outings and both accompanied and unaccompanied outings was put in place. This programme, in accordance with its recommendations, was designed to provide objective evidence as to whether the person concerned continued to be a risk by reason of his continued mental disorder and was kept under continuous review.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Since the failure of this person to return to the Central Mental Hospital, my Department has consulted with the hospital authorities to review each of the cases of the persons in the guilty but insane category who have or may be granted temporary release from the hospital. While there are no watertight guarantees, I am satisfied the level of risk that another such person might not return from a temporary release is minimal. The Deputy will undoubtedly be aware that such periods of temporary release are granted from time to time for rehabilitation and humanitarian purposes either on foot of recommendations under the advisory committee procedure or as a result of periodic reviews undertaken by the Central Mental Hospital authorities. All such releases carry an element of risk which cannot be avoided if the State is to properly manage their cases. I assure the Deputy that my Department seeks to ensure at all times that any such releases are consistently monitored and kept under continuous review.</P>
    <P>There are no arrangements in place between this jurisdiction and others for the compulsory repatriation of persons in the circumstances described. The problem is not unique to this country and while there are no specific proposals at EU level at present, the matter has recently been receiving attention at the Council of Europe. The committee of experts on the operation of European conventions in the penal field has recently discussed the desirability of making arrangements under which mentally disturbed <Col N="69" /> offenders who are not convicted because of their mental disorder but require detention because they may be dangerous as a result of their disorder could be returned to their country of origin. My Department is represented on this committee and I have instructed my officials to press for a satisfactory resolution of the matter which we are discussing.</P>
    <P>I will publish shortly a comprehensive restatement of the law on criminal insanity. That legislation will contain extensive provisions dealing with fitness to plead at a criminal trial; it will contain a definition of criminal insanity and provide for a new verdict of &ldquo;not guilty by reason of insanity&rdquo; to replace the present &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; verdict; and it will introduce a new plea of &ldquo;guilty but with diminished responsibility&rdquo; in cases of murder. In addition, it will establish a new review body whose function will be to review the cases of persons detained after verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity or findings of unfitness to plead. The introduction of the new partial defence of diminished responsibility is likely to have the same effect as it had in England, that is, it will result in a decrease in the numbers of pleas of insanity, the accused preferring to plead diminished responsibility. If a plea of insanity is made and the prosecution feels a plea of diminished responsibility is more appropriate it can so argue before the court and the court will decide the matter. A person found guilty but with diminished responsibility will be convicted of manslaughter, not murder, and be liable to a term of imprisonment, at the discretion of the judge, of up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister was aware that Mr. John Gallagher, the person referred to, was found guilty but insane and that the verdict of the Supreme Court was regarded as an acquittal, why did he give the impression, following Mr. Gallagher's absconding, that if he were traced in the United Kingdom the UK authorities, under existing extradition procedures, would return him to Ireland when the Minister knew that was not so? Will the Minister acknowledge that if any person currently in the Central Mental Hospital as a result of the verdict of guilty but insane should now abscond and go to the United Kingdom there are no procedures in place to ensure their return to this jurisdiction? In the circumstances, will the Minister acknowledge there is a serious public risk arising from the present position? What steps has he taken during his period as Minister, and particularly since Mr. Gallagher absconded, to put arrangements in place to ensure persons in the Central Mental Hospital as a result of a verdict of guilty but insane will be returned there should they abscond not only to the United Kingdom but to other European countries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this is a complex and difficult matter internationally. The position in this jurisdiction is that <Col N="70" /> a verdict of guilty but insane is treated as an acquittal in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment in the matter. An amendment to the Irish criminal law as it relates to insanity is clearly required and it is my intention to bring forward legislation in this respect in the early part of next year which will provide that a person may plead not guilty by reason of insanity but will also provide that a person will be in a position to plead guilty by reason of diminished responsibility. The plea of guilty by reason of diminished responsibility will become commonplace where people would normally have pleaded guilty but insane. This has been the experience in England. The case will then be dealt with by the court as if it were a conviction for manslaughter where there is a guilty plea or a person is found guilty by reason of diminished responsibility. There is a deficiency in Irish criminal law in this respect. It is true that our criminal law, as it relates to insanity, is outdated and has been surpassed by developments in psychology and psychiatry. This is recognised as a European-wide problem in so far as the movement of people with mental illnesses who have been guilty of offences across Europe is concerned.</P>

      <P>My Department's records indicate that the number of asylum applicants awaiting a determination of their applications at first instance at 31 October 2000 was 10,320. The number awaiting a decision at appeal stage at 31 October 2000 was 2,536.</P>
      <P>On 5 July 2000 the Government announced approval for the immediate recruitment of 370 additional staff for asylum case processing and appeals and to deal with consequential repatriations, with the possibility of more staff being made available in the future. This will allow a number of strategic objectives to be achieved. It will greatly increase processing capacity, including appeals, to deliver more speedy decisions on applications for refugee status leading, in due course, to the completion to finality of the processing of all new asylum applications within a six month period which will ensure those who qualify clearly as refugees will receive decisions on their applications much more speedily and that applications where there is clearly no basis for qualification will also be dealt with on a faster basis. It will mean the elimination of the asylum applications currently in hand as soon as possible and dealing with the increased numbers of repatriations that are expected to arise in respect of persons whose applications for refugee status are refused. Additional accommodation is also in the process of being sourced for this purpose.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to allow asylum applicants to work pending a final decision being made on such applications. However, the Government, as an exceptional measure, agreed on 26 July 1999 that those asylum seekers who have been in this country for more than 12 months, who are still awaiting a final determination of their application for refugee status and who have been compliant with their obligations as asylum seekers should be given the right to seek work. The arrangement applied to those who sought asylum here up to 26 July 1999, as soon as they crossed the 12 month threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1999 the Government decided to remove the requirement that an employer must obtain a work permit before employing asylum seekers covered by the 26 July 1999 Government <Col N="72" /> decision. It also decided that each eligible asylum seeker should be issued with a letter confirming entitlement to work for presentation to potential employers and the Department arranged accordingly. To date, more than 2,500 such letters have issued. My Department is currently evaluating the outcome of the arrangement. Preliminary figures, however, indicate a low uptake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the average waiting time for determining asylum applications? How many people seeking asylum have been waiting in excess of 12 months for an initial decision? How many people seeking to have a decision made on appeal have been in this State for in excess of 12 months? Will the Minister acknowledge that there is a public interest and duty to allow asylum seekers to have some feelings of personal dignity and that a substantial number of those seeking asylum wish to work? The Government is failing to allow them to do so and, as a consequence, is failing to allow them to show a degree of independence and enjoy the personal dignity to which they are entitled. By doing so the Government is fomenting and contributing to the creation of racist sentiment by giving rise to a public perception that asylum seekers are simply interested in living off the State and being in receipt of social welfare when the overwhelming majority of them wish to obtain independent employment and make a contribution to this country and support their families through their own endeavours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Public confidence in any police force is maintained by insistence on high professional standards and a proper accountability framework within democratic structures. In the case of the Garda Síochána, it is accountable through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Dáil, the courts and the Garda Complaints Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have acknowledged the perceived shortcomings of the present Garda complaints system and that there is a level of dissatisfaction with its operation. It is my intention to shortly bring proposals to Government for amendment of the Garda Síochána Complaints Act, 1986, on foot of the review of its operation which is nearing <Col N="74" /> completion. The proposals will enhance the board's current investigative role into complaints against members of the force.</P>
    <P>As regards the establishment of an independent ombudsman's office to monitor the work of the Garda, I understand the Deputy is suggesting the adoption in this jurisdiction of the model now prevailing in Northern Ireland. However, the House will appreciate that the situation in Northern Ireland in relation to policing differs substantially from the position which has obtained in this jurisdiction. There were particular concerns in the North about policing and there was a serious lack of confidence in the police, at least among some sections of the community. As a result of a report by the now Senator, Dr. Maurice Hayes in 1997, it was accepted by all parties, including the police, that the existing complaints system was inadequate and should be replaced by an independent police ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that it would be appropriate or beneficial in this jurisdiction to follow the particular confidence building measures found necessary in Northern Ireland. I am confident, however, that the proposals I intend to bring forward to enhance the operation of the Garda Complaints Board will address effectively the concerns expressed in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that by tabling this question I was not criticising the Garda Síochána but attempting to provoke a debate on maximising public confidence in the complaints procedure? Does he accept the Garda Complaints Board is outdated, particularly when we consider there were fewer than half the number of complaints when it was established in 1986 than there were in 1999? Does he also accept it is not appropriate to ask a member of the Garda Síochána to investigate the behaviour of a colleague?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a European committee dealing with this area commented unfavourably last year on the fact that when a tribunal is set up by the current board system a Garda officer on the tribunal assesses a member of his force and that this is not the most appropriate way to assess the behaviour of members of the Garda Síochána? In the interests of public confidence and of ensuring confidence among the members of the force we should consider establishing an independent ombudsman's office to assess the behaviour of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Coveney's assurance that his question was tabled in an attempt to have a public debate on this matter and that it is not intended as a criticism of the Garda Síochána. I also accept there is a need for some change in this area and that things have changed and moved on since 1986. It is true that the European committee on the prevention of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment took a certain view on the participation of members of An Garda Síochána in the board and as investi<Col N="75" /> gators. It is also true that a representative of the Garda sits on the Garda Complaints Board and that members of the Garda subsequently investigate the complaints made.</P>
      <P>We are engaged in a review of the 1986 Act. Certain recommendations have come from the Garda Complaints Board, the DPP's office and the representative associations of An Garda Síochána. We also have our views in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. All these will be considered in the context of change. It would be unsafe and unwise of me to state what precisely the proposals will be without the review being completed. There is an argument for not having a member of the Garda Síochána on the Garda Complaints Board and, from the point of view of public perception, not having the Garda Síochána investigating itself. Nonetheless, complaints have been dealt with fairly. I hope the question of change will be addressed positively. There are points for and against.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The figures requested exclude Mountjoy Prison for which up-to-date statistics are not readily accessible in the short time available to reply to the Deputies' questions. The prisons information technology project, which is now close to completion, will include a comprehensive prisoner record system which will ensure the availability of such information more speedily in the future.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of the Government's prisons building programme, there has been a significant reduction, confirmed by the above figures, in the number of abscondings from prison institutions. It is hoped that the numbers will continue to reduce as the instances of temporary release will be limited to prisoners on structured temporary release programmes.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;absconding&rdquo; refers to a person leaving the confines of an open centre without permission or a person who breaks the conditions of temporary release by failing to return or sign on at an appointed time or place. As soon as the prison authorities become aware of such an incident the matter is immediately reported to both the Garda and my Department. At that stage the offender is deemed to be at large and he can be arrested without warrant and returned to custody without the need for fresh court proceedings. In addition, when a person is recaptured after absconding from an open centre he or she is automatically returned to a closed institution.</P>
    <P>An element of trust is crucial to the successful operation of even the most secure prison in the State and while there is a lesser emphasis on security in open centres there are very good reasons for this. There are a number of safeguards in place to minimise incidents, such as absconding from open centres.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>For example, all inmates are pre-selected as being suitable for open conditions, they are monitored on a daily basis and some are, from time to time, for various reasons, including security related ones, returned to closed prisons. The risk of absconding is of course a major consideration in the selection of offenders for open centres. Other factors include the nature of the offence, the length of sentence left to serve and the individual offender's compatibility with the regime.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, it is the case that some offenders do on occasion abscond from open centres. This, however, must be kept in context. The vast majority of offenders who transfer to such institutions complete their sentences without incident and this is testament to the overall integrity of the regimes there and to the prisoner selection process.</P>
    <P>The second category of abscondings are those who fail to return from temporary release at the assigned time and place and are then deemed to be unlawfully at large. Over the past decade, many prisoners were released early due to severe overcrowding in the committal prisons, particularly in Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick's Institution. As a direct consequence of the Government's ongoing prisons building programme, <Col N="77" /> there has been a significant reduction in the proportion of offenders on temporary release, from 19% of those serving sentences in November 1996 to 6% at present. The number on temporary release has fallen from a daily average of 550 to 200 in the same time period.</P>
    <P>Temporary release is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way. While due regard must be had to any risk which a particular release might pose, the generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be even greater if, in certain cases, attempts at planned reintegration of offenders were not made since they must return to the community in any event on the expiry of their sentence.</P>

      <P>According to the figures made available by the Minister, 344 people absconded during his period of office, excluding those who absconded from Mountjoy Prison and who are at large under his political watch. Does he agree that if an estimate of the likely numbers who have absconded from Mountjoy Prison is included, approximately 500 people sentenced to terms of imprisonment who were given temporary release during his period of office, presumably by the application of the revolving door technique, have not returned to prison? Does he also agree that these make a mockery of the administration of justice and the sentences imposed by the Judiciary? Does he agree that not only have they not served their time, but that nothing is being done about them?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify why 79 of those who absconded in 1997, 78 in 1998 and 85 in 1995 are still absconding this year? Why is this still happening? What steps have been put in place to address this problem? It is a scandal that approximately 500 people continue to abscond.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter may use whatever superlatives he likes but the facts will, as always, speak for themselves. As I explained &ndash; perhaps the Deputy was not listening &ndash; the vast majority of persons in this category were deemed suitable for and granted temporary release but did not abide by their temporary release conditions. The Deputy is trying to give the false impression that 500 people have escaped from prison. That is not the case.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy please listen? In November 1996, when his party was in government, 19% of the prison population were on temporary release. Today it is 6%, a reduction of 13% over a period of three years, the reason being the prisons building programme. Thirteen prisoners were on temporary release from Cork Prison last Friday; 135 were on temporary release two years earlier.</P>

      <P>Over the last three years the number of indictable crimes has been reduced by 21%. Over that period the Government engaged in a very extensive prisons building programme. The number of people on temporary release, as a percentage of the prison population, is far lower today than it was when the Government took office. This is not a coincidence. There must be a parallel between the numbers not on temporary release today and the reduction in the numbers on temporary release. I am approaching the stage where the revolving door will be closed and where people will only be given temporary release in a structured way to assist them with their rehabilitation into society and not where, as happened under previous Administrations, people were released on the sole criterion that there was no prison accommodation for them.</P>

      <P>In my written reply of 5 October 2000 to Parliamentary Question No. 13, I indicated that at its meeting on 21 September 2000, the Government approved of the drafting of a Bill to provide that, subject to the Constitution, and in so far as it is possible to do so, legislation should be construed and given effect to in a way which is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.

On a previous occasion the Minister indicated to the House that he favoured the indirect or interpretative model of incorporation of the convention.

      <P>It appears that Ireland was the first country to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights, while it may be the last to incorporate it in domestic law. The reason for that is the 1937 Constitution, which has been extensively interpreted by the courts, especially with regard to human rights. Some argue that it is more expansive and comprehensive than many conventions, including the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>I can only assume that because this country has what may be called a Bill of Rights, it was not seen as urgent for this jurisdiction to incorporate the convention. The Deputy is aware that it was open to any individual to bring his or her case to Strasbourg.</P>

      <P>Not all the protocols will be incorporated in the legislation but the majority will. The position on parental rights is given expression in the convention and my interpretation of the manner in which the convention is being incorporated is that, in so far as a law may be in contravention of the Constitution at domestic level, the Constitution would take precedence. This arises because otherwise the Judiciary might make a decision in a particular case which might subsequently oblige the Oireachtas to introduce amending legislation or to hold a constitutional referendum. It was felt that if the European Convention on Human Rights were directly incorporated into Irish law, that could ultimately result in the Judiciary supplanting the Legislature in terms of making legislation and that this would be unacceptable in a democracy.</P>

      <P>The 1997 programme for Government included, in the context of measures to combat the drugs problem, the creation of a drug courts system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences. In accordance with this commitment, I requested the working group on a courts commission, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, to consider the establishment of a drug courts system in Ireland.</P>
      <P>On 25 September 1998, I announced that the Government had approved the publication of the fifth report of the working group on a courts commission &ndash; Drug Courts &ndash; which sets out details and experiences of drug courts in the USA and other European jurisdictions. I also announced that the Government had approved the establishment of a drug courts planning committee to prepare plans for the establishment of a drug courts pilot project in the District Court.</P>
      <P>I established the drug courts planning committee in February 1999 to develop an integrated cross-service strategic plan involving court supervised treatment programmes as an alternative to custodial sentences on the basis of the reallocation of resources, both budgetary and staffing, from other programmes, including programmes in the criminal justice area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning committee reported to me and its recommendations include: the commencement of a pilot project in Dublin's north inner city to run for a period of 18 months; the availability of the pilot project, on a voluntary basis, to persons aged 17 years or over who have pleaded guilty or have been found guilty of a drug or drug related offence that would ordinarily warrant imprison<Col N="81" /> ment; the provision of services, from which a rehabilitation programme capable of being tailored to meet the individual needs of each offender, will be primarily provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the probation and welfare service, FÁS, and the Department of Education and Science with further services sought from other agencies as and when necessary and the availability of these services on a dedicated basis under the auspices and control of the drug court.</P>
    <P>In April 2000, following careful consideration of the report in my Department, I forwarded the report of the planning committee to the Courts Service for implementation and I understand that the steering committee, which was established by the Courts Service to organise and monitor a pilot drug court in Dublin, plans that the first sitting of the drug court will be held on 9 January next.</P>
    <P>The pilot programme marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and is designed as an alternative measure for dealing with less serious and non-violent drug offenders. I look forward to assessing the results of the pilot project in due course.</P>

      <P>The proposal for the introduction of a drugs court was included in the programme for Government and I do not accept that <Col N="82" /> there has been an undue delay in the implementation of the pilot project although I wish it had progressed more quickly. Last Monday, the steering committee established by the Courts Service to plan the implementation of the pilot drug court confirmed that the project will commence on 9 January 2001. This issue went before the working group on the courts commission which specifically requested the establishment of a planning committee in order that this project could be undertaken properly. The working group was very anxious that the requisite resources would be provided and that there would be proper co-ordination between various Departments.</P>
      <P>When I received the report of the planning committee, I forwarded it to the Chief Justice in his capacity as chairman of the Courts Service Board and requested that the drugs court pilot project be implemented. I understand the matter was brought before the Courts Service Board on 13 June 2000 as a result of which a steering committee was established which held its inaugural meeting on 11 July. The first drugs court will be established on 9 January in Dublin's north inner-city. I will certainly consider the extension of the project to other areas of need and will give specific and favourable consideration to Cork.</P>

Will the Minister detail the additional resources, services, treatment facilities and staff resources which have been put in place or are envisaged to provide for those people who will appear before the drugs court, given that increasing numbers of people are on waiting lists for detoxification and treatment services in that area and throughout Dublin? There is a perception that it may be necessary, in future, for people to be convicted in the drugs court before receiving treatment. Will the Minister allay those fears and assure the House that treatment will be provided for those currently on waiting lists, in addition to those who appear before the drugs court?</P>

I assure the Deputy that this programme will be comprehensive. I am satisfied that when it is up and running, it will be successful.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the fourth progress report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution which stated that our present system of appointing judges should be retained. As I have already indicated to the House on a number of occasions, the Government has approved the drafting of the necessary legislation to address the recommendations contained in the report of the working group on qualifications for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts and certain other matters. Central to that report is the recommendation that solicitors with appropriate qualifications and experience be eligible for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts.</P>
      <P>The Government legislative programme indicates that the necessary Bill entitled the courts and court officers Bill will be published in this parliamentary session. In that Bill I propose to deal not only with the eligibility of solicitors for appointment to the superior courts but with a range of other court related matters. Some modifications in respect of aspects of the operation of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board are in contemplation. However, the details of my proposals will be announced in the usual way on publication of the Bill, following approval from the Government.</P>
      <P>On the question of the board's procedures, the Deputy will be aware that under section 14 of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board adopts its own procedures to carry out its functions under the Act. I am satisfied the board has and is carrying out its functions in an efficient and effective way and, accordingly, I do not propose to comment on the detail of its operations.</P>

How will the vetting procedure operate when we extend the number of available candidates for judicial appointment from the couple of hundred of barristers to include the several thousand solicitors? Will an interview system be an integral part of that procedure?</P>

My difficulty is that the board is responsible for its own procedures and I may not interfere in its operation. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board other than to say I know the numbers who apply to become District Justices, for example, can be quite significant. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has its own vetting procedure in that respect. It makes a list available to the Minister and to my knowledge no individual has been appointed other than from that list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The board's functions should be not only to foster talent and creativity but also to foster trade and entrepreneurial spirit and flair. It must become involved in productions as a major partner with sales on a global market. Most of our productions do not sell on a global market. They get a few weeks' run in the Irish Film Centre and are then confined to the archives. Distribution and marketing is critical, hence the need and importance of strategic partnerships with international producers as equal partners.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Board's enhanced role in encouraging television productions is welcome. The linking of TV3 with Granada Television is very exciting. Granada Television is one of the bigger global producers of drama and TV3 must be encouraged by the Irish Film Board to explore with Granada the possibility of developing international projects for an international audience. We must encourage film production, of which we are proud as a nation, for an international audience. At the same time we must realise that the best cinema sometimes may not reflect positively on our society &ndash; films such as &ldquo;Angela's Ashes&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Commitments&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Love Divided&rdquo; certainly do not convey the typical Bord Fáilte image of Ireland, but were successful.</P>
      <P>In her contribution the Minister said our films must reflect the culture of Ireland, but they must reflect the culture, warts and all. We must be blatantly honest in our representation of issues even if to do so is not complimentary to us as a nation.</P>
      <P>The performance of the Irish Film Board must also be measured in a broader perspective. Irish films must travel and portray things about Ireland and the world. The board must foster talent as well as subsidising film production. Also, it is no longer good enough simply to make a film. In the USA, for example, 20% of finance goes into research and development and 40% goes into distribution and marketing the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must wait for the board's five year strategy plan. The Kilkenny report recommended that section 481 of the Finance Act should be extended for seven years, but in the most recent Finance Act it was extended for only five years. By the time the board has published its five year strategy, one of the five years specified under section 481 will be over. Surely, the section should be further extended in the forthcoming budget to at least cover the period of the strategic plan. If the Kilkenny report recommendations are inter-dependent, then it is important they are all implemented as soon as possible. The thrust and intent of the Minister's speech is good but it lacks <Col N="87" /> a sense of urgency to put all the elements in place. Also the film board funding should allow for inflation. Irish producers must form strategic alliances as equals and must bring to the market place something that is different and stands out. We have the scripts, the entrepreneurial spirit and a global audience to be conquered. To conquer that market, the involvement and identification and targeting of equity investors is important.</P>
    <P>The American film industry is driven by equity investors. We have that type of climate in Ireland yet. It would be great if we could get people such as Denis O'Brien and Tony O'Reilly to invest in the film industry. There is a great deal of money around but we look at the section 481 option all the time when perhaps we should seek more equity investment as in America. A typical Irish film costs about £2 million to £3 million which is a good deal of money whereas a truly successful film internationally, apart from the exceptions such as &ldquo;The Full Monty&rdquo;, would cost £20 million to £30 million which is almost half that provided for in the Bill. We should look at the scale of our ambition which must be put in context. We must seek to promote our cinema on the same level as that which &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; has done for dance, as U2 has done for music and as Martin McDonagh and the Druid Theatre have done for drama.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the area of training. Given the decline in the training role of RTE and the dramatic growth, interest and participation in the multi-media sector the question is whether there is enough expertise available for this buoyant sector. Perhaps the time is opportune to consider establishing a national film school &ndash; a school of expertise and excellence which would co-ordinate all the current training and education programmes and develop them further and seek to have on its teaching staff the best expertise in the world. There is no reason we could not bring in visiting lecturers, top directors, top editors, top camera people, designers, and photographers to the school. If we are to take the film industry a step further this is a type of scenario that must be considered. This centre of excellence I am proposing may be what is needed to provide the expertise to move the industry on to a higher level of excellence.</P>
    <P>On the issue of decentralisation, bringing the screen commission under the ambit of the Irish Film Board is welcome. I am a member of County Kerry screen commission but it is difficult to do any business because of the 40 mile SIPTU rule. Where any Irish crew travels, say, 40 miles from St. Stephen's Green, it has to get overnight maintenance and travelling expenses of varying amounts with the result that it would have cost a film production company, such as Hallmark, which came to Ireland to film John B. Keane's &ldquo;Durango&rdquo;, almost £0.5 million more to film it in Kerry. I hope the screen commission, under the ambit of the film board properly resourced, would take cognisance of the existence of county <Col N="88" /> film commissions around the country. There are major opportunities to be exploited.</P>
    <P>There are also other aspects of the film industry such as script writing. The film industry is not just happening in Dublin, it can happen all over the country and there must be a decentralisation policy to involve the whole country, to give assurances to people who are trying to write scripts on the periphery of Ireland. There are people in Dingle doing distance work with companies all over the world but that must be encouraged. I witnessed the effect of one short-cut film entitled &ldquo;Most Important&rdquo;, about a greyhound. The impact which that film had on a small community in Lixnaw, County Kerry, was enormous. We could have 20 more such films. On one level we have to look at the national aspect but on the other hand we have to look at the local aspect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust and intent of the Minister's statement which contained many new policy proposals. The question now is to put them in place. We have a thriving industry to foster. Various elements must be put in place to ensure its potential will be realised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important though short Bill. It gives an indication of a commitment by the Government to the development of the film industry in Ireland. It is appropriate to pay tribute not only to the Minister but to her many predecessors who initiated the work of the Irish film industry in Ireland and particularly the previous Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who endeavoured to secure financing in more difficult times to allow the Irish Film Board to develop the film industry in Ireland. The Bill provides that funding shall be increased from £30 million to £80 million. This arises from the fact that the allocations to date have been utilised. If that is the case it indicates a vibrant industry that will continue to grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds available to the Irish Film Board must be made available to those interested in promoting the film industry in Ireland. That the board provides development loans and capital loans puts an onus on the board to become a type of banking institution. Given that it provides loans there is a necessity for great care to be taken. I have no doubt when members are vetting the applications which come to them, great care is taken in apportioning loans and making the decision to give a particular applicant or company loan approval. I welcome the fact that these funds are available to applicants who have bone fide<i></i>applications before the board. However, I am concerned that the recoupment rate of these loans is low. Surely there must be a concern in some quarters within the board or with the Mini<Col N="89" /> ster and the Department that the recoupment rate of these loans is as low as 3%.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister make available the reasons such a small amount of the loans are recouped? There is a substantial write-off as many of the projects fail. This is inevitable in all industries but the number of failures in this sector is probably higher than in other sectors of the economy in the current climate. I am concerned about this issue and I hope the Minister will explain why the board fails to recoup more of the loans it disburses.</P>
    <P>The annual report outlines the criteria used by the board to assess projects. These include the creative strength of a project in that it has to be imaginative, original and compelling and have the potential to attract an audience. There are different kinds of audiences and it is difficult to be sure that an application will fit this criteria.</P>
    <P>The track record of the creative team is another of the criteria used. One difficulty faced by management teams in securing financial approval is that people in the industry have not had much time to establish a track record as it is a new industry. I welcome the criteria which specifies the employment of Irish people in all grades. There is no doubt that the growth of the film industry has led to increased employment, not only in those areas directly associated with film production, but in spin-off industries. This is a welcome development, particularly in areas which have become the focus of film making. In addition to Ardmore Studios in Bray, many areas along the west coast, particularly in County Galway, have been used as locations for important films. My first memory of the Irish film industry was the production of &ldquo;Alfred the Great&rdquo; in Kilchreest, County Galway, in the mid to late 1960s. At that time any employment, even temporary employment, was important to many people. The industry has moved on significantly since then but it is important to know that the development of the industry has created employment and financed spin-offs, particularly in areas classed as disadvantaged in the past.</P>
    <P>The spend generated by a developing industry is important, particularly in rural areas such as the west. It was important that the Minister endorsed the location of the Irish Film Board in Galway and the report indicates that the lease option on the premises runs up to 2020. This is an endorsement of the fact that the board will remain in Galway even though it may be necessary to open offices in Dublin and other areas as the industry develops. Decentralisation to the provinces is welcome and important, particularly to the west in this instance.</P>
    <P>This is a new industry and I welcome the fact that when the Minister established the Film Industry Strategic Review Group in 1998, under the chairmanship of Mr. Ossie Kilkenny, the remit of the review was to make recommendations for further development in the years ahead. The group's recommendations were to strengthen, broaden and reconstruct the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> The group also set many strategic goals, the first of which referred to script development. The funding now available should encourage script development in whatever way possible as it is the basis for our indigenous industry. We have a great tradition in writing but we must specifically encourage script development for the film industry. As this is one of the strategic goals set by the review group, I hope work will rapidly expand because if we do not develop this area work will come to a rapid halt at some point in the future.</P>
    <P>The commitments given by the Minister and the Government towards the development of production finance is important as they will lead to the promotion of Ireland in many different ways. We must recognise that the film board works in conjunction with many other State agencies such as Forbairt, FÁS, IDA and Bord Fáilte. Given that the film board impacts on all of these areas, one can see the importance of the role it is now playing.</P>
    <P>If one talks about the film industry in Ireland, one is talking about the film board and the section 481 tax concessions. These are the two key elements of the industry's success and I hope they will be supported for a long time. I hope the Government will support the board long into the future and that it will indefinitely extend the tax benefits for the film industry. Some argue that the film industry receives more focused attention than other sectors by way of incentives. This is the case but the industry deserves those incentives as it has grown from a low starting point to great heights and to such a success. It is important that the Minister for Finance recognises this fact and continues to provide this valuable concession in the future. Unless it is understood and recognised that these facilities are needed for the future, a sense of uncertainty could easily creep into the industry.</P>
    <P>It is important also that there would be greater emphasis on the area of training and education in film. That means we would discuss making available funding to allow people to develop all the professional skills required in a vibrant industry. The part played by FÁS to date must be recognised but there is a need to identify further training opportunities not necessarily at one level but at all levels in order that the industry can draw on expertise to develop and grow quickly, particularly in the area of technology. That is the way the industry is developing. There is no other industry in which technology is in greater demand and therefore we must be sure that Ireland has readily available at all times professional personnel capable of producing the highest quality films.</P>
    <P>It is good that for the first time we have established awards for Irish film making. There is now a new award and substantial prize of 20,000 for the best emerging Irish film director and also an award for the best short cuts, Oscailt. I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, will recognise the importance of Oscailt in the production of films as Gaeilge. If there was <Col N="91" /> one other area in which Ireland has been successful and to which I would want to refer here, it must be that of the independent television sector, TV3 and also TG4. More people are tuned into TG4 on a regular basis than those for whom we give that station credit. This is a recognition of the importance of our language to our culture. Previously in another forum reference may have been made to the decline of the Gaeltacht areas, but we must realise that in the Galltacht, in urban areas throughout the country and in Dublin, scoileanna náisiúnta lán-Gaeilge have been established. That development has not just occurred as a result of the actions of people who were cranks or who wanted just to be different from the ordinary people around them. It has developed out of a desire in those people to make sure their children are educated in and like their language. When one recognises the part played by TG4 in that area, one must also recognise the part played by Raidió na Gaeltachta in making the Irish language readily available to the listening public. I am delighted, therefore, that Oscailt has been recognised in the new awards for Irish film makers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional funding being provided in the Bill. I am sure the success of the Irish film industry, whose birthplace is really at Ardmore Studios, will continue in the future. Ardmore Studios is a professional outfit, to which great credit is due. The industry is now expanding into an important national industry. I hope these additional grants, which provide confidence, will be extended by future Ministers and that there will not ever be ambivalence in Government about support for the continuation and development of this new industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which allows the Irish Film Board to increase its expenditure from £30 million to £80 million. As Deputy Burke stated, the people involved in this industry experienced difficulties for many years. There were days when there was nobody to support them and when people laughed at them for wanting to make films in Ireland. I congratulate them and wish them well. They did the State a great service. They were prepared to fight for the industry and to invest in it when the Government was not prepared to give them the support they needed. A former Minister introduced tax breaks to encourage people to come here and make films. At the time I complimented him for having the vision and foresight to see that there was an industry here which could be promoted and supported and that we had people capable of being as good as those in the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>In the past there was evidence of that potential in films made in Ireland and in the people involved in them and we saw these films winning Oscars and competing with the best in the United States, where money is no obstacle. Our people were able to compete with, and beat, the best film makers and to turn out the best films.</P>

      <P>I always look forward to seeing it on RTE over Christmas. Although I have not bought other films on video because I am not a film buff, I bought that film because it is my favourite. It depicts a part of the country which both the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, and I love dearly. The Government does not treat the west fairly and it can take many things away from us in the west, but the one thing it cannot take away from us is the natural beauty of the landscape and the people depicted in &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; and many other films. One such film which comes to mind is &ldquo;The Ballroom of Romance&rdquo;. I went down to Ballycroy to see where they repaired an old ballroom for that successful film. Tony Chambers, the great man with a saxophone from Newport of whom I am sure the Minister of State is aware, is now a living legend as a result. People all over the world know of Tony Chambers because of &ldquo;The Ballroom of Romance&rdquo;. He was a local man who took part in that film with professional actors. There are people who still talk about the old dances and ballrooms, and that film projected an image of Ireland which some people, who think we are now too sophisticated and have passed that stage, like to forget.</P>
      <P>What keeps this country going is its people, its beauty and our way of life. We are losing much of that at present. People do not have time to talk to each other any more and they do not have time to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to visitors who come into this country. We were always a friendly nation and that is one thing which should not go from us. The way the economy is going, I hope the people will not lose that friendliness.</P>
      <P>Over the years there has been much criticism of RTE's role in film but, in fairness, it has not done a bad job. It did not have the finances it needed. There is now a report on the running of RTE and on cut-backs in that area. Perhaps RTE is living beyond its means and has squandered funds on occasion, but at the same time it has done a good job producing films over the years. Maybe there is a bit of squandering in that company but, at the same time, it has done a good job over the years producing films. The recent production, &ldquo;Amongst Women&rdquo;, in which it played a large part, was shown over a number of Sunday nights and I enjoyed it. It used mostly Irish actors. We have to give it credit for that. Sometimes it does not have the resources and the money to continue to do more of that. It should be encouraged, helped and assisted as with other people involved in this very good industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when &ldquo;The Field&rdquo; was filmed in Leenane. That sent out an image of this country, its people and part of our tradition. Looking at the other side of it, think of what it did for Leenane at a quiet time of the year, what it did for the area and the employment it created. Parts of <Col N="93" />&ldquo;Amongst Women&rdquo; was filmed in Islandeady, on the most beautiful beach in Ireland, Bertra Beach, and in Mayo Abbey. Hotels, guest houses and other accommodations were filled in the winter months when there was nothing happening and the tourism season was over. These people came in and took over these places for a number of months. The film itself when produced, was very good and was sold abroad.</P>
    <P>People laugh at it but I am not ashamed to say I love to watch &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; on a Sunday night with Joe Lynch as Dinny. It is one of the most popular programmes in Australia. It is an excellent programme with excellent actors. I am glad to say Mick Lally is a native of Tourmakeady and is proud of it. He is not ashamed to say he is from Mayo. He is a native Irish speaker and is somebody who is proud of the county and the west. I am sure he saw bad days. He started off as an amateur and became a professional. Like Joe Lynch, Gabriel Byrne, the Cusack family and many others, he has made a major contribution to this industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that at last this Government &ndash; and I hope future Governments will follow suit &ndash; is supporting and helping this industry. I hope we will continue with what is being done in this Bill and that we will see further funding being provided for these people because it is a high risk business &ndash; it takes a lot of money, investment and nerve. These people have to go out and look for investors and try to encourage people to come to this country. It also helps our own people. There are very talented people in this country who have shown the rest of the world what they can do. They also learn from these people coming in &ndash; they learn from the British and the Americans &ndash; and I am sure we teach them some things. We have certainly been successful. I compliment everybody involved in this industry.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the future, Governments will see fit to provide tax breaks to it. I make no apology for whatever tax breaks the Government believes it should give to this industry because it deserves them. It is a high risk industry and anything that it high risk should be supported and given grant aid. The Government should not be afraid to do that or to be prepared to invest, to take a chance and to give the tax breaks necessary.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Ulick Burke talk about TG4. As somebody from the west, I want to compliment it. It is doing well and is using its head. TG4 is taking up local stories and films and is doing business quite well. It has started to cover the local county finals. If RTE had done this in the past, we would have had no local radio. RTE would have had total control of the radio stations if it had radio Mayo, radio Kerry and radio Galway and had done what the BBC did in the past. It would have had no competition and would have had total control of the airwaves. It did not do that and it has paid the price. TG4 is now taking that up and is doing well.</P>
    <P>I watch TG4 the odd night and see John Wayne on it, although he does not speak Irish. There is <Col N="94" /> the odd good film on TG4, although not all are in Irish and there is nothing wrong with that. It is certainly doing a good job promoting the Irish language. There are subtitles in English and they help and assist people like me who are not native Irish speakers and who are trying to learn the language. I wish it well. There was a lot of criticism of it but I did not criticise it on the basis that &ndash; if it worked, it worked and if did not work, it did not work. It deserves support and help and it has done a fine job.</P>
    <P>Something that worries me about the film industry is the lack of cinemas. Recently, a prominent cinema closed down in this city and staff lost their jobs. More and more cinemas in rural Ireland are closing down because of Sky and digital television. I compliment RTE and the Government on trying to protect our own national heritage. I am talking about supporting events like the All-Ireland, the FAI cup and racing events. It would be wrong if Sky, because of its monopoly and money, could say to the GAA that people who do not get a ticket to an All-Ireland will have to pay to watch it. RTE should have the rights to certain events and should be supported in that regard. I think it is now in legislation. We should not allow people like Rupert Murdoch to come in and take over our national heritage because what will happen is that Sky will take over and we will lose RTE, TV3 and TG4. That would be a shame. These stations should be protected and I suppose that will happen in the promised legislation on local radio, television and the licence fee and so on. All these stations should get a percentage of the licence fee.</P>
    <P>Local radio stations should also be assisted by the State to enable them to produce home made and current affairs programmes. They should not have to depend on advertising alone and they should be assisted by the State. We should not be ashamed to do that. Local radio does a good job and it should be supported and helped. I say to people who continually knock RTE that they should not always knock it. It does not do everything right, but it certainly does not do everything wrong.</P>
    <P>Many people in certain parts of the west still cannot get RTE 1 or Network 2 because they do not have full coverage. Recently, we gave a licence to TV3 but again people in many parts of the west cannot pick up that service. If somebody gets a licence from the State to service the State, they should provide that service to the entire State and not only to part of it &ndash; the population centres like Dublin, Galway and Cork. The Minister should insist that people getting licences are given a time span within which to introduce a service.</P>
    <P>In the Gaeltacht in north Mayo &ndash; the Minister of State is aware of this problem &ndash; people who love, speak and promote the language cannot watch TG4 simply because they cannot get the signal. That is outrageous and it should not happen. The Minister should say to those providing <Col N="95" /> the service, particularly RTE, that they must cover the whole State.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the people involved in this industry. There were brave people in the past who worked hard to build up this industry to be very professional. They deserve to be supported and this Government should not apologise to anybody for assisting it in any way. Each time a film showing our scenery is made, which is seen throughout the world, the industry is doing the job Bord Fáilte has failed to do for the last 50 years. These people have done more for tourism, Ireland and scenery in Ireland than Bord Fáilte has done and they should be helped. I know that is part of what is being done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government should look at tax breaks and at any other way in which the industry can be assisted. It is a high risk business and should be supported. We should make no apologies for doing so. I welcome the Bill and compliment the people involved in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to speak on this important legislation, the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which is welcome. Deputy Ring spoke about increased investment. To restore tax relief for moneys spent in film production to 100% from 80% would be very beneficial because, as Deputy Ring correctly stated, it is a high risk and hugely competitive business.</P>
      <P>In terms of revenue to the State, there is a huge risk in dealing with technology based companies. Ireland is a world player, together with the United States, in that area and there is no reason we cannot be equally recognised in Europe as being proactive and pro-development. We are competing with the UK where the relevant Minister is offering a competitive deal to entice companies to make films there and in Northern Ireland. We need long-term commitment and vision. The increase in equity to £80 million will be appreciated because it is needed.</P>
      <P>The film industry here could be worth £532 million. This would contribute significantly to Government coffers according to a new report from Film Makers Ireland Limited. The projections are based on an annual growth rate of 10% to 11% per year, which the report's author, David McWilliams of the London-based consultants, claims is logical based on the past four years growth. He also warns that abolishing section 481 or reducing its attractiveness will result in a viable industry being choked. Given its potential globally, it is silly to abolish a scheme that does not cost the State anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will extend the film tax relief for 12 months, pending publication of specially commissioned studies on film relief by the Minister for the Arts, <Col N="96" /> Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The outcome of this will be interesting.</P>
    <P>The FMI report sets out to dispel what it terms misinformation, half truths associated with the issues of tax, financing and the film business and to set the record straight by working on the numbers. According to its dispassionate economic analysis, using the most sophisticated model for the Irish economy, the industry contributes more than its fair share to the economy. Its findings have already been passed to the commission which is studying the issue. The FMI findings show that the Irish film industry has grown by 3,400% since 1992 compared with 100% globally in the same period. That speaks volumes. Despite this rapid growth, the industry is only at the cottage industry stage and needs support. Approximately 50% of all film finance in Ireland applies under section 481. This means it does not make sense to scrap or diminish it at a time when the industry holds so much potential. I am not an expert on the subject, but it is important to give encouragement in this area.</P>
    <P>Financial investors' faith in the sector is evidenced by the fact that investors are paying a premium of between 40% and 70% for shares in broadcast media and entertainment companies. After telecom, office equipment, software and electronic semi-conductors, the broadcast media and entertainment sectors is where investors see most growth potential. We need to analyse the full benefits the industry can offer. The whole area of broadcasting and television network is changing.</P>
    <P>The IDA persevered in difficult times with the software sector because it had a vision of what the future could hold. Similar vision is now needed to maximise Ireland's film industry. The IDA had a vision and software had great potential in this country. It is wonderful what a small country like Ireland achieved in this area. Film fits well into the profile of industries which Ireland is seeking to foster. It is a high risk and high value added business. The west has managed to move up the value added curve by making these types of industries its own. One could have a fantastic film but if one does not have a good salesman, good promotional people and the right connections, a film could be thrown in the rubbish heap. Of every ten films, approximately one or two are successful.</P>
    <P>Tourism has been important in the past and it will be in the future. As we begin the new millennium, it is important to look back at the success of that industry. We can celebrate success, particularly in the tourism industry. The films made in the 1950s starring John Wayne and others epitomised the thatched cottage and a simple Ireland. This appealed to the American market. However, things have changed rapidly. While there are mega bucks coming from the United States, it is important also to support home industry. When those films were made in the 1950s, Ireland was 100 years behind the United States. This is not the case in the new millennium. A radio tech<Col N="97" /> nician who relays material back to Ireland from New York told me the United States is far behind Ireland from the point of view of updated equipment. We have a lot to be proud of because we have come a long way in 50 years.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has grown spectacularly in the past decade, creating thousands of new jobs. This has contributed millions of pounds to the economy and enriched the lives of visitors and the Irish people. This did not happen by chance but as a result of enlightened policies, public and private investment and the hard work and professionalism of workers. Those who operate in the tourism sector are professionals because they have invested hugely in the industry. These people who have worked with State bodies are worthy of appreciation. Some may criticise Bord Fáilte. We cannot isolate Bord Fáilte because the regional tourism authorities in all the regions have been effective.</P>
    <P>It is important that we are now talking about Irish films. Tourism and the film industry go hand in hand. The film &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo; was made in Ireland and credited with being produced in Scotland. We have a unique opportunity to provide tax incentives to those who wish to make films here but these films should be credited with being produced and filmed in Ireland. Over the years Ireland has been renowned throughout the world for the success of its playwrights, authors and so on. We have the dedication, commitment, professionalism, facilities and scenery to entice people to visit this country. The Australian Film Board provides huge incentives to entice people to promote Australia.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is providing additional investment. Under existing legislation, the board's capital outlay was set at £30 million in 1997. This Bill will help to secure the future of the Irish Film Board. The future of the board should not be in doubt.</P>
    <P>It is important to persuade people to cushion the risks taken by film makers. Other speakers have referred to the growth in the number of television channels. We must support small indigenous companies. While I am not an expert in the film industry, I am sure there are small companies who need the cushion of Government support and who, given encouragement, would invest in the industry. From small acorns great oaks grow.</P>
    <P>Support should also be given for the marketing of Irish films. Small companies should not have to endure the same hardship as large ones. Enterprise boards deal with small companies. Enterprise Ireland supports Irish companies while IDA Ireland deals with external companies. A board within the Irish Film Board should deal with small companies and share their difficulties. Too many talented people fail because they do not get support from banks and large institutions.</P>
    <P>We have seen successful productions of films with historical themes. The series &ldquo;Seven Ages&rdquo;, telling the history of the State, was very successful. However, we should not neglect contemporary themes and the development of our regions. <Col N="98" /> We are seeing an unprecedented wave of Irish and Irish related feature films. No fewer than 11 titles are due for release before the end of this year. These include &ldquo;The Book that Wrote Itself&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beyond the Pale&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Closer You Get&rdquo; which is a romantic comedy set in Donegal and marks the first outing for Uberto Pasolini since he made &ldquo;The Full Monty&rdquo;. Another film due for release is &ldquo;Flick&rdquo;, Fintan Connolly's stylish study of Dublin's low life. These new Irish films, with Pat Murphy's &ldquo;Nora&rdquo;  and others will be eligible for this year's Irish Film and Television Awards to be held in the Waterfront Hall in Belfast in December. It is important that we encourage this development.</P>
    <P>Film is an enormous business. We see cartels in small businesses but they are even greater in the film business where the influence of Hollywood is vast. It is important that small companies receive support. Tourism will be the greatest contributor to our future economy. It has already surpassed agriculture. Hoteliers and others have taken risks in the industry and new attractions are emerging throughout the country. Our visitors will not have to return to the same old venues. Irish film producers can promote every tourism region in Ireland. The Minister, Deputy de Valera has agreed to return the O'Hara coaches, which were given to the State in 1952, to the new county museum in Ballymote, County Sligo. The museum will house many notable artefacts which are now in Dublin. This is a wonderful development. The O'Hara coaches are now stored in a warehouse in Inchicore, Dublin where no one has seen them. Tourists will be interested to see them in their home in County Sligo. I acknowledge the Minister's initiative in returning the coaches and in supporting the new folk museum in Castlebar. A new market is being created for our heritage.</P>
    <P>It is important that our heritage is recorded on film. The story of the O'Hara carriages should be interpreted on film. Our story has been interpreted in the literary sense but it should also be told on film. Very few people read broadsheet newspapers or watch the evening news on television. It is important that our history is told in a way which can be easily understood by the viewer or listener. Our history must be made available for visitors to Ireland on video and audio tapes.</P>
    <P>Film has traditionally been transported on huge reels through the film distribution network. General Film Distributors distribute film to cinemas throughout the country. In future, film will be delivered by wire. We are in a rapidly changing world and jobs will be lost in the film distribution industry. Film is a hugely competitive business and the Irish market of four million is small by world standards. Our scenic beauty is an attraction for film makers. We have professional people with great commitment. Companies such as TV3 and TG4 are also wonderful assets. The audience figures of TG4 rose by 92% in the past year and its total reach is now approximately 600,000.</P>
    <P>Small is profitable. I appeal to the Minister of <Col N="99" /> State to encourage small film production companies in conjunction with the tourism industry. Film producers from the United Kingdom should not be given greater incentives than Irish producers. We must not impose tax handicaps on Irish producers. We can compete with foreign producers and we should do so.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this short, simple Bill which will give extra capacity to the Irish Film Board by allowing the ceiling to be raised on authorised issues from £30 million to £80 million. This is most welcome.</P>
      <P>The film industry in general is volatile, precarious, competitive and ephemeral in terms of how it can wax and wane during economic slumps and booms. Despite those characteristics, County Wicklow has a long tradition of film making spanning over 80 years. It has had its ups and downs, but the long thread has not ever been completely broken. We take a certain pride in it and we have a sense of ownership of it. We do not want it to be limited in terms of further growth and expansion.</P>
      <P>If somebody wanted an example of the impact of film making in any particular context, I would cite Avoca village in County Wicklow. For a number of years Avoca suffered high levels of unemployment and people were leaving the village. There was despair among local people about the ability to attract new employment opportunities to replace the jobs that had been available in the local mines. There were mining operations around Avoca for many years which provided employment for hundreds of families. The closure of the mines appeared to be the end of the hopes of many villagers that they would be able to get work in their community and feel secure about their children gaining work in the area.</P>
      <P>Avoca now has international fame as the setting for &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo;. It has been a dramatic change for the village in terms of new opportunities for people directly in the television series as acting extras or providing services to the film makers and also in the enormous spin off that has occurred through the provision of attractions for tourists who arrive in busloads to visit &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo; or Avoca. The difficulties now in the village involve traffic congestion because of the overload that occurs on occasions.</P>
      <P>Avoca has been transformed by the film making there not only in relation to &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo;, but also in terms of other film companies making films in the area. It is a good example of the benefits and spin offs that local communities can experience from film making. There is also a consciousness that &ldquo;Ballykissangel&rdquo; will not last forever and there is an onus on us all to ensure that whatever long-term benefits can be achieved from this type of activity &ndash; we appreciate that film making by its nature ends very quickly &ndash; are realised as far as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, Wicklow County Council established the County Wicklow Film Com<Col N="100" /> mission and it is now in operation. It is designed to encourage and support film making and to ensure that County Wicklow continues to grow and to be recognised as a base for making foreign and indigenous films. This year has been good. Eight major productions have been filmed in Ireland and all of them were partially shot in County Wicklow or were based at Ardmore Studios in Bray.</P>
    <P>The facilities at Ardmore Studios are completely booked out this year and the same is projected for next year. Some major, big budget movies have been scheduled for the summer of 2001. Aside from assisting these productions while they are filming on location, the Wicklow Film Commission has also started compiling a number of databases which will be vital in providing back up services for the industry.</P>
    <P>An important part of the work of the commission is ensuring that the sourcing of skills and services can be done easily and efficiently and for the maximum benefit of those living in the county. The database is in the process of being compiled and its aim is to assist key people in the industry in sourcing locations, crews, services, production offices and extras in the county. A slide library is also being put together which can be entered through the revamped Wicklow website. It is important that this work continues and the local authorities in Bray and Wicklow are directly supporting the film commission through financial contributions.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see the work on which the commission is now embarking. For example, one of the activities it intends to take on this year is wooing the prolific Indian film industry. It is one of the biggest film industries in the world. It produces more than 800 films a year, which generate £133 million. A total of six billion tickets are sold worldwide to Indian movies. I am not sure if many of those are sold to Irish people, but there is no shortage of people who want to see the films. The Indian market worldwide is bigger than the American market.</P>
    <P>These films often contain a dream sequence and these sequences are often filmed in places such as Holland and Switzerland. One sequence, which may last up to ten minutes, could cost approximately $1 million. The Wicklow commission is currently setting about trying to encourage Indian film makers to make some of these sequences in County Wicklow which has a magnificent landscape that is ideally suited to such sequences. It is important to continue developing our attractions as a location for film making.</P>
    <P>In terms of that attraction, there is a need to consider training. It is of less benefit to us if local young people with skills are kept outside the loop. We can develop more skills in film making to ensure that there is a good take up when foreign film makers come here to film and use our resources, but this cannot be done without financial investment at one level or another. Ardmore Studios is very busy, but we must ensure that <Col N="101" /> resources and technical facilities are in place to keep the wheels moving.</P>
    <P>As other speakers said, there is a deeper cultural aspect to film making. This is apart from the practical aspects of generating incomes in households and ensuring that communities get direct financial benefits from the economic activity which does not last long. As I said, film making is short-term. When a film is made, the whole caravan disappears. Sometimes it is as if it never happened despite the amount of activity and labour involved. Once the film is made, everybody disappears and life returns to normal. It is ephemeral in that sense.</P>
    <P>There is a huge cultural impact in terms of the product. The images that are presented, the stories that are told and the concepts that are delivered through television or cinematic films have an enormous impact on our lives. Irish film makers need to be encouraged and supported. Other areas of the arts have been successful and it has become a truism at this stage, particularly with regard to literature. In recent times, there has been a Nobel prize winner and there were Booker prize winners in the past. There are major literary figures who are highly regarded internationally who write Irish books in the sense that they are clearly placed in and draw inspiration from Irish society and the Irish context.</P>
    <P>It is not as easy to encourage that kind of expression in film making because invariably there are costs and technical skills involved. The making of a film is a co-operative effort and requires many people. Even low budget films require money, unlike literature where, to a great extent, the writer has a word processor and a creative imagination to start writing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's approach, the strategic planning and greater resources are very welcome. However, we must always be conscious of what we are fostering. In terms of indigenous talent, we must ensure we are not simply manufacturing a product for dissemination but that we are conscious of quality and talent. That does not always depend on the largest budget. &ldquo;Saltwater&rdquo; is one example of Irish film making that encapsulates quality work which does not incur huge financial demands. It is a good example of fine writing and acting which resulted in a good film set in the modern Irish context rather than an atavistic film, of which we have seen too many, dependent on historical figures for subjects. This is a modern Irish story which in filmic terms is very satisfying and of a high quality. It is interesting that the director, Conor McPherson, was already internationally recognised for his writing for theatre. In this case, he directed a film which he had also written. However, I suspect it will not receive the kind of international recognition his plays have received. The distribution networks that operate globally create difficulties and obstacles for a country like ours when we are trying to ensure the works produced by indigenous talented people can compete with the big budget films distributed worldwide by very profitable <Col N="102" /> large companies that do not see the benefit of the small scale production, no matter how good its quality.</P>
    <P>People have cited the example of Australia as a country which, when it began to promote its own film making industry, was not in a great economic position to do so. Yet significantly, it was able to develop a very distinctive style of film making and to get the message across globally rather than regarding it as simply a product for home consumption. The Australian genre of film is recognisable worldwide. We need to do the same for Irish films. Distribution is the key.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous interest in film making. We would be in trouble if every young person who would like a job in film making realised his or her dream because the system would be overloaded. It can only be to the benefit of Irish film making and the Irish film industry if young people have an interest in and a passion for film and contribute their talents to building the kind of film industry of which we can be proud and which also reflects the aspects of modern Irish life which are increasingly complex.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are, in effect, a multicultural society is an aspect of our lives which has not been fully explored in artistic terms, but it will be. I am sure people are already working on film scripts concerning the subject of multiculturalism and which reflect the changes occurring in our society that we may only partially understand. Very often, works of art teach us about ourselves and illuminate aspects of our lives that may be unclear to us. They can inspire us but they also have a prophetic quality in that they can look into the future and tell us something about ourselves that only the artistic talent has the capacity to do, to become our prophets in a way that we as politicians are not necessarily able to do.</P>
    <P>It is important that we ensure there is an Irish film industry in the future and that Irish film is part of the artistic canon that we have developed across the various media of literature, the visual arts, theatre, music and so on. It is more difficult to develop a strong capacity in film making because it is largely about very powerful commercial interests promoting what they want to see happen, what they want to sell and what does sell. A person told me some time ago that the focus in America is on the average film goer, who apparently is around 15 years old. It would be difficult to develop a fully rounded set of films if we concentrated solely on very young people, but apparently the 15 year old young makes up the big market.</P>
    <P>There has been a renewal of interest in film. More people are going to the cinema. There was a time when the whole industry seemed to slump but the growth of cinema and videos as the natural follow-on from film making will ensure films continue to be made. We need to think carefully about what will influence society and where we fit in that global scale of film making and provide resources for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the strategic planning in this area <Col N="103" /> and I am pleased the Bill has the general support of the House. However, we must ensure we can foster an industry which is also a form of artistic expression which, in an increasingly homogenous world, will become increasingly important to us. We must ensure our sense of identity as a society is reflected in work of this nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important Bill for the reasons set out by a number of previous speakers who obviously have studied the film making industry. This country lends itself very readily to film making for a variety of reasons. We have scenery unrivalled anywhere in the world and acting is a feature of our tradition and culture. It is true that Irish people lend themselves naturally to acting, which is a good thing. It is a feature of our culture and heritage of which we should be proud and one we should use to the best of our ability. Previous speakers referred to the recent technological developments in film-making that have brought it within arms' reach of much smaller organisations that have an ability to produce quality films and market them successfully.</P>
      <P>There are two elements in film production. One can make a film that is a work of art and good to watch but is a box office flop. There are many such films worldwide. The board must be careful of that. While it should not be necessary to be driven totally by success at the box office, it must be recognised that it is the means through which the film industry is best advertised. I was an avid film buff. It was a poor week in which I did not see three films. Unfortunately, times have changed and I seldom see them anymore. The days of cramped, smoke filled cinemas that left everyone with streaming eyes have long since passed. Cinemas are more comfortable nowadays. As Deputy McManus said the tendency now is to see films on video in the comfort of one's own home with no need to worry about driving and parking. If we want to attract cinemagoers we must provide facilities for them to have a social evening &ndash; public transport, safe parking, the ability to have a meal and see the film.  </P>
      <P>I remember seeing films when I was much younger that featured places such as the Grand Canyon and the sun was always shining. I make a plea to film-makers not to show reels of film that feature a continuous downpour of rain, especially if the actors and actresses are filmed outside. I know of one film in the not too distant past in which the country is depicted as a rain sodden island, among other things, and there is nothing as offputting to a potential tourist. While we must present matters as they are, within reason, that is not the best way to present the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Modern technology has lent itself to film making and to the development of this country. We must present ourselves, through film productions, as a modern, fast-growing, effective economy and <Col N="104" /> move away from the old stage Irish attitude that was readily depicted in films. We must have something that is modern, youthful and presents itself worldwide as a production from a country that is competitive. They are simple, basic ingredients which, if not incorporated into film production, will give a negative picture to potential film goers. Whether that affects the quality of the film or its success at the box office rests with the production. Some literary works are more adaptable to the stage than the cinema. The Film Board must look at that issue in the course of the offers, referred to by the Minister, in regard to film making here. It is important that consideration be given to the viability of a film under certain headings.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many of us do not appreciate the technically perfect production or the animation films used as a filler by television stations some years ago which were often technically perfect and illustrated a particular point of view. There would be a rapid decrease in cinema patronage if such productions were shown there. The Film Board should look carefully at that aspect when deciding which films to support.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the degree to which this country lends itself to film making as a backdrop. Deputy McManus mentioned Wicklow. It is an exceptionally beautiful county. Equally, other counties have much to offer. There is a tradition of film-making in Ardmore in Wicklow, which has had its ups and downs over the years. It appears to be on the up and up at present. I hope it will be successful in the future and will avail of the assistance the board will offer to the various productions that will emanate from there. There is no better way to deter tourists from coming here than to show the country as a rain sodden island. It is depressing. However, if the film depicts an indoor scene with people enjoying themselves while the rain pours down outside it has the opposite effect. It works well if the scene changes and you see a sunlit beach or whatever. It is a question of careful and clever marketing. I understand that it costs millions of pounds to have products advertised on the screen even for an instant.</P>
    <P>I used to and still watch James Bond films, although there are not as many of them made now and the personnel have been changed many times. I remember James Bond liked a particular brand of drink, which I will not mention because we cannot become involved in commercial advertising. He also liked it in a certain way and at a particular temperature. A different drink of Irish origin for which he had a particular liking was shown in another film. The product is known worldwide for its association with that particular film. I mention that to emphasise the importance of advertising through films. The greatest film ever made can be used for advertising and for projecting a positive national image just as easily as it can be used to give a negative impression of the country. We should use the Irish Film Board to emphasise the positive points and we should <Col N="105" /> not readily support those who present the other side of the coin.</P>
    <P>This country has a great tradition of writers and artists of all descriptions. When I was younger I spent a lot of time reading. However, like everything else, that has gone by the board. The Irish Film Board must consider the unsavoury depiction of Irish society which has been glorified at times. Writers are entitled to write what they wish but I object to looking at it in graphic detail. I have the right not to support such productions. I hope the Irish Film Board will consider that as part of its role in encouraging the film industry. We know that unsavoury things happen in this country, as they do in other countries, and we would prefer if that was not the case. I am not sure their projection on the screen is good as it can cause some people, particularly those about whom the story is told, to become more depressed than they were before it was shown.</P>
    <P>We are a nation of artists and storytellers. This country is an ideal location for a film industry. However, I am critical of the number of films we have promoted in recent years. A number of films were promoted here over the past 25 or 30 years and a lot of work was done by the Department. It is important for senior operators in the film industry, including actors and actresses, to come to the country so they will develop an interest in it. Some actors and actresses also work in the production area or will become future producers. It is important to encourage them to come here so they know the type of facilities and services which are available and the technological advances which have taken place. As previous speakers said, our technology is often ahead of the technology available elsewhere. There is no other way to get that message across to these people who are important because they are either potential investors or will be able to encourage investors to proceed in a particular direction.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to scenery. We used to be depicted as Ireland of the welcomes. However, some people say we are not as welcoming as we used to be. There is no better way to address such issues than through the film industry. We can portray the right image through scenery, etc. We would give a sad impression of the country if we depicted ourselves as downtrodden, poor and hungry. Some people are poor, if not necessarily hungry, and they have not benefited from our economy. We must ensure that the plight of socially deprived people is not added to by something we produce. We all come from various backgrounds. It does not do any harm to reflect on that from time to time and on the impact some productions may have on our thinking and our lives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which should be used to project a positive image of the country. We should try to remove the image of a rain sodden and hard drinking island of doubtful chancers which was projected on a number of occasions in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. With most other Members, I welcome the Government's decision to increase the funding from £30 million to £80 million. This is a large increase which will play a positive role in the film industry. Excellent producers have brought the Irish film industry to an international stage and have created a lot of excitement, employment and confidence in Irish society in the past ten years. While many of the films were produced in the United States, a number of them were produced at home and they were box office hits. This is extremely good advertising for the country. If the money is administered and spent properly, it will benefit the country.</P>
      <P>A number of questions arise regarding the Irish Film Board. How many films directly funded by the board have been commercially successful? When the board was established with funding it was envisaged that it would be used for investment in movies and I understand the money invested by the board has made a return of approximately 10% to 15%. The board was established as a self financing funding organisation, but that has not been the case. While I do not criticise it for that, I raise these questions with a view to ascertaining how future funding allocated to the board will be used and whether it will be viewed on a commercial basis or as a subsidy.</P>
      <P>Generous tax breaks are provided for film production. In addition, the industry can avail of the generous 10% corporation tax rate. I support these measures. They have played an effective and popular role in enticing movie makers to work in the country. They should be encouraged on the basis that they will attract further outside involvement. At one stage the Minister had difficulty persuading her Cabinet colleagues that the tax breaks should be retained. I am glad they were because they have paid handsome dividends. It should also be noted that our competitors, especially in the British Isles, introduced tax breaks for their film industries. While Britain had a well established film industry, we have had to create a favourable environment to persuade international film makers to work here.</P>
      <P>The Government says it is investing £80 million in the film industry, which is welcome. However, from the information I have obtained, it appears to amount to a subsidy rather than an investment. We should be honest enough to say that the industry is being allocated a part subsidy and part investment. The Minister will argue that in most other countries the return on investment in the industry amounts to between 10% and 15%. That is not very worthwhile and in that context a subsidy is reasonable, especially if the Government considers that the money is necessary and will be well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Clune's speech, while the semi-State boards and bodies have been established in good faith, they have a tendency to expand, especially on the administrative side. In <Col N="107" /> this context, much of the allocation of £80 million to the industry could get lost in administration before it reaches the coal face, where the money should be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>That cannot happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not happen, but administration costs in other State sectors have mushroomed at the expense of front line expenditure. We must watch that.</P>
      <P>I understand that two local authorities have established film commissions, one in County Wexford and the other in County Wicklow. I also understand Counties Donegal and Leitrim are in the process of establishing commissions. This has arisen because people see the opportunities that arise in their locality from film production, which can play a full part in the development of the local economy and an enormous role in the promotion of an area. That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The film commission proposed by Leitrim County Council will comprise six members from the elected members of the council, the arts officer, the county manager, a representative from the Screen Commission of Ireland, union members and a small number of people with expertise in the film industry. We hope the commission will steal a march from a number of other locations by putting proposals to the Irish Film Board to help indigenous young film makers who seek locations for their work. I commend the management of Leitrim County Council for this initiative and I hope it will be successful in ensuring that films are made in the county.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers have outlined the advantages of film making to their county in terms of promotion, activity in the local economy and the involvement of actors and others working in the arts. Perhaps the Irish Film Board could do a marketing job on the involvement of the Members of this House in promoting their areas for film production. The television series &ldquo;Amongst Women&rdquo; was made in County Leitrim, which was an interesting experience for many living in the county. The series was based on the novel by John McGahern, an excellent writer who resides in the county. A large number of amateur actors, members of drama societies around the county, were used as extras. That created a welcome interest in the arts. The Irish Film Board should play a role in involving people on the amateur side of acting. This could be done by tapping into the strong amateur drama culture in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years, films were made in Redhills in County Cavan, an area close to my home in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency. Those films, which were made by major Hollywood producers, created great hype and brought phenomenal levels of money into the area. They also resulted in people who might not otherwise have visited the county doing so. <Col N="108" /> Redhills is now viewed as one of the most idyllic film locations in the country. The availability of such locations makes it easier for the Irish Film Board to entice increasing numbers of film makers into Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing debate on whether film students should be educated in a theoretical or practical way. FÁS was formerly involved in this area but the task has since been sub-contracted to another institution. If one compares the numbers of people involved in this industry ten years ago with the current figures, one can see there has been a massive growth in this area. The former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, must take a great deal of credit for his role in creating the upsurge in the Irish film industry. The Government of which he was a Member took some very courageous steps in this area which laid the foundation for the industry's success. I do not often find myself in agreement with Deputy Higgins but I compliment him on his role in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is now a higher level of interest in film making at second level than existed heretofore. Young people are recognising the opportunities which exist in the industry and we must educate them properly. As happened in the computer industry, talented, well educated and trained people will encourage major players in the industry to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>We can go from strength to strength in this industry and we must also provide encouragement to Irish producers and film makers. The Celtic tiger phenomenon has provided a large amount of wealth to the private sector which is now in a position to invest in film making, whereas ten years ago we depended to a far greater degree on foreign investment. We now have the indigenous financial wherewithal to encourage people to become involved in film making, production and distribution and I would like to see the Irish Film Board directing the bulk of its funding towards this area. I do not have any difficulty with the provision of subsidies in this regard because we must encourage the involvement of young people in this industry and we must create a solid foundation which will enable them to stay in Ireland making short films, feature films etc. The backing of the Irish Film Board, the Government and the private sector will be required to achieve that objective. Tax breaks in the form of 10% corporation tax are necessary because investment in film making can be quite risky.</P>
    <P>The Irish film industry has grown dramatically over the past ten years but much more can be achieved over the next ten years, depending on the direction provided by the Minister, the Government and the Irish Film Board. I look forward to the development of a very strong indigenous film industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this Bill's speedy passage is necessary to allow the Irish Film Board, which has reached its existing ceiling, <Col N="109" /> to assist practitioners in the industry. I was encouraged to contribute to this debate by the contributions of some of the other speakers whom I watched on the television monitor. It is unfortunate that the broadcasting legislation is also being dealt with in committee today by my successor, Deputy de Valera, who is responsible for film and broadcasting. That is not to detract from the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, who also has an interest in this area.</P>
      <P>Of the initiatives taken to encourage film production early in 1993, particularly between January and May of that year, the re-funding of the Irish Film Board was perhaps the most significant. Other initiatives included the reformulation of section 35, the establishment of a market for independent film makers through the public service broadcaster under the Broadcasting Act, 1993 and opportunities in regard to what was formerly Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Board was the most important because it had not been funded since 1987. The board's remit was to promote film in its best sense as an expression of Irish culture and the role of film making within that culture. The board was a minimally staffed, efficient and well operated body at that time and enormous credit goes to Dr. Lelia Doolin, its first chairperson, and the board's staff for their management of public funding. The board was a model in terms of the frugality with which it administered its affairs.</P>
      <P>During my period as Minister, I attended Council of Ministers meetings in Europe at which we discussed MEDIA I which subsequently became MEDIA II. There was a great deal of discussion about the fact that of the 15 EU member states, none watched less than 90% of films sourced in the United States. While it was generally felt that some of the finest films in the history of film making were made in the United States, it was also felt that not all the films viewed by people should come from one corner of one country and that there should be diversity in this area.</P>
      <P>In the early stages of discussion on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, the question arose as to whether film was merely another commodity to be traded internationally and to be governed by rules of competition within a globalised market. The fringe position, supported by Ireland, argued in favour of an <i>exception culturelle</i>, the effect of which was that film was a cultural expression and was, therefore, more than a commodity. Given that film was a cultural expression, it therefore became important not merely to resist US produce but to have the capacity to produce one's own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck by the huge proportion of films viewed in Europe; on the basis of cinema seat sales there has been little less than a revolution in viewing habits. Whatever the US might say, it was distributing basket loads of films in a near monopoly position and it was impossible to obtain a recently released film without having to purchase several others as well. In fact a US prod<Col N="110" /> uct was being dumped to some extent on the European market.</P>
    <P>Not only was the number of films being affected, but so too was the genre of film making in relation to films which were commercially successful. In terms of the structure of the narrative and the plot, the genre itself was becoming American and we were losing the tradition of European film making in its wide diversity from Fellini in Italy to Fassbinder and Jean-Luc Goddard and others.</P>
    <P>For Ireland the best days are yet to come and I support the Bill. Film, being an art form, is capable of carrying the expression of the people in entirely new ways. If there is confidence that there will be a continuity of funding for film and of debate on the place of film in culture then one will probably get the best possible result. To some extent I say that in answer to those who might say film and what the Irish Film Board does must be commercial. That misses the point. It is precisely because people sought to go into competition with an American model of the international film market that people lost faith in film. It is important to remember that for the average film from the US, up to 30% of the gross cost is spent on distribution.</P>
    <P>I am worried that we have not continued our work in MEDIA II, which has a fund of about 400 million ecu, to the same degree as under MEDIA I. I very strongly argued that the money should not be spent on the basis of a Hollywood model but that the spending should be tiered, i.e that money be available for low, medium and large budget films. The position of France, Britain and Germany has always been that they wanted allocations for big budget films which would leave small countries such as Ireland and Denmark at a disadvantage. Therefore, it is very important that the Irish Minister is present to defend the structure of MEDIA II in such a way as to ensure the best benefit for the largest number of film makers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In case anyone is in doubt about the value of what has happened in relation to film, I calculate that between 1993-97, for which I had responsibility, about 4,000 full-time job equivalents resulted from the film industry. It is probable that no area has been submitted so thoroughly to external evaluation in relation to spending. Film has many advantages in terms of bringing investment to remote areas, being clean and involving highly talented and skilled work. A film with a budget of £1 million involves up to 52 skills ranging from grip to hairdresser, make-up, camera, sound etc. Therefore, it is very important to recognise that the Irish Film Board is our principal source for assisting young film makers in the future. It is also important that the board builds on its experience in relation to the demand for funding for script development, of film itself and in relation to taking part of the equity in films.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see the closed cinemas when travelling through the country, some of which have been turned into garages. Had I the opportunity <Col N="111" /> and time I would have liked to have had those abandoned cinemas restored as multi-purpose art centres. They would have been very attractive as such given their central location in many rural towns. The buildings have relatively similar architecture and were very important in the life of small places and I still hope we might be able to do something about them.</P>
    <P>Another initiative which originated with the Irish Film Board and which is assisted by it is the touring cinema, which will go to areas where people would not ever see a film. Shortly there will be an opportunity for primary school children to see films in the morning and secondary school pupils to watch films in the afternoon and evening. This encourages a connection with film among rural communities and is welcome.</P>
    <P>We suffered a big disadvantage when Virginia Bottomley, under pressure from Mrs. Thatcher, decided to take Britain out of EUROIMAGE, a funding mechanism which requires participation by three countries. We had an immense advantage in having another English speaking country as a partner and had only to find one other partner. I understand Britain is not yet part of EUROIMAGE, which was very important for the development of scripts.</P>
    <P>In terms of the relative effects of the different instruments I have mentioned &ndash; the rejigging of section 35 and creation of a market for independent film makers &ndash; the re-founding of the film board was the most important as it facilitated us doing something specifically Irish which was truest to the art form of film.</P>
    <P>I found that film makers when asked for business plans, etc., were well able to produce them quickly. I cannot say all those who put together section 35 packages showed they were able to catch up in terms of film in the same way. In other words film could be converted to what was required in relation to commerce and the market, but it was much more difficult to convert the market and commerce to investing in film.</P>
    <P>The time from deciding to make a major film to its distribution takes not less than three years. There was an awfully powerful case for having section 35 &ndash; later section 481 &ndash; available over a period of time, thereby providing certainty. I think 50% of section 35 investment came from the US, and being able to put our package of incentives into the marketplace in competition with other packages and incentives was powerfully assisted by knowing the package would be in place for several years.</P>
    <P>I recall being told more than once that films do not make money, that it had been tried twice and that twice we had retreated from it, but I think the Department of Finance, which was barely converted to film, entirely missed the point. However, as I always said in reply, the Department opposed electricity on the basis it would never catch on. We have managed to get over their worst hesitations in relation to film, but that was only done by having external evaluations of <Col N="112" /> what was taking place. There is a very strong case for making a commitment over a period of years and for giving a lead role to the film maker.</P>
    <P>It would be very foolish to have tension between the commercial side of the film industry and film makers. There would be nothing to distribute or give a tax break on if there were no film makers. Things should be led by film makers. The film board knows best about the art form and deals most directly with the practitioners. It has a very lean administration and is in a very good position to give a lead.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the possibility of a film commission in Leitrim. There are some limitations to what one can do, but certainly the time has come for local authorities to allocate the task of facilitating film making to one person. In New York it is handled by a special commission within the mayor's office which licences people to film on the streets, and one could find other examples.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that some of the authorities in Galway have not moved, despite my repeated suggestions, because they were in a good position to do this as are others. However, I hope they will move.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is important relates to the question of what is commercially successful. What is commercially successful is a very limited part of film making. I cannot recall the figures but of all films successfully completed about 15% or less go into successful commercial distribution. That leaves 85%. Of those 85%, if one has a budget of £0.5 million or £1 million one is talking about 52 stills. One can in fact create the capacity for film making in joined film and have it as an expression of oneself. It need not be always in that end of what is being commercially distributed.</P>
    <P>It is the most exciting and the most wonderful medium of the century that has just gone. Jean Luc Goddard once said, when asked to speak in a programme about 100 years of the film industry &ldquo;is it 100 years for film and the Lumiere brothers moving images, or is it 100 years of celebration of people charging other people for looking at images on a wall or on a screen&rdquo;. There is a difference between the industry. We should not have any under labourer or inferiority complex about what is happening. The best films in the United States have been made by independent film makers from New York, some from Harlem. The big money that is bullying its way through the European discussions is represented by people like Jack Valenti, Motion Pictures of America and the studios of the west coast. In many ways it is an area in which, across the world, we are looking at the domination of film viewing by a product coming from a very small area. There are wonderful exceptions to that, for example, in India there is a strong indigenous film production sector. Film making is a vital contribution to the cultural diversity of Europe and is a vital contribution to the cultural expression of ourselves. It is a medium that is separate and cannot be reduced, for example, to literature as an <Col N="113" /> art form. It is a separate set of skills, a separate kind of insight, a separate aesthetic. If we are to have a debate about it, a well-funded film board is important.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department of Education and Science will listen and that the Minister of State will communicate to it the immense value of having film appreciation as a regular feature at second level. When people know the different possibilities of this art form they will have a higher standard in what they demand and in what they look at. It is also powerfully democratic to be able to read the film and get behind it so that one knows that what is a commercial dross made according to a very limited formula is just that, and that there are other capacities within this form.</P>
    <P>Finally &ndash; I am beginning to sound like Barry Desmond &ndash; the small number of staff available in the Department are immensely talented and dedicated and work long hours. They are the people who contributed, before I arrived in the Department, to the working group on the film industry which reported in January 1993. Most of the screen commissions of a regional kind anywhere in Europe had three and four times the number of staff available in the Department. Equally the film board was very much understaffed. I strongly support the Bill and hope that film will always have all party support in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support and welcome the Bill. I wish the Minister of State and the Minister well. Also I pay tribute to the former Minister who did tremendous work in that portfolio. There was a reference earlier to local authority arts officers who were put in place by the former Minister. They have made a significant contribution to all local authorities. In Longford we are lucky to have an efficient arts officer. We now see the results at school exhibitions and elsewhere. All these new ideas are co-ordinated by the arts officer. Certainly a great awareness was fostered by the previous Minister and continued by the present Minister. There is evidence of that today. That there is a demand for extra funding speaks well for the industry. The proper course of action is to support it. We all know the great influence films have on our lives. We can all remember back to our schooldays when the local hall was the scene for films. I recall the film arriving in the village on a Monday night and being shown in the local hall. Unfortunately the hall had a flat floor. If one arrived late the chances were that one's figure would be projected on to the screen because one had to walk across the hall. Many a person was spotted arriving late and their names were called out. On another occasion, the man who was showing the film forgot to bring the screen. He has now gone to glory. One of the local ladies said, &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;. She went off to her house and brought back her best sheet which acted as the screen on the wall. The film being shown that night was &ldquo;The Devil's Hand&rdquo;. That sheet is still in the hall. She would not take home <Col N="114" /> the sheet because &ldquo;The Devil's Hand&rdquo; had everybody on edge.</P>
      <P>I mention those memories to illustrate the influence of film on people. I have no doubt that films and videos etc. have the same influence on young people today. That is why the emphasis must be on quality of product and quality of idea. All sides agree that much of the violence in society comes from the influence of videos, films etc. People can argue about it but there is no doubt about it &ndash; monkey see, monkey do. That is an important aspect of film that should not be forgotten in the overall industry.</P>
      <P>People flocked to see the famous film &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; in which John Wayne featured. From what we can gather it had a great influence abroad. It showed Ireland at its best as regards scenery etc. and a quality of life which people enjoyed. Since then quite a few well known films have been produced here. The atmosphere and the location is ideal for the industry. It would be disastrous if the position of the film industry was not improved financially. Script writing is a vital part of the industry. Without a good script one cannot start. Great efforts have been made by the film board which has broadened the industry. I commend FÁS for its efforts in training and providing people with the basic skills to develop their talent whether in script writing, on the technical side or whatever. These factors have combined to improve the industry and to make Ireland a serious player in the film business. Deputy Gerry Reynolds mentioned that his local authority has recognised the importance of the film industry and is interested in developing it in the county. There is no doubt that the industry can add to the image and promotion of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister and Minister of State well and I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for the comprehensive debate on film even though the Bill consists of only one line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clune referred to our literary heritage. One of the issues which has come to light in the course of the industry's development, and which was commented on in the Kilkenny report, is that screen writing is a distinct creative process involving particular visualisation skills which transcend literary genres. The development of these skills will be a key area for training to ensure that our great culture of story telling can be effectively conveyed to the large and small screens. The film board will also increase investment in script development. This change of emphasis is already <Col N="115" /> in train. Furthermore, experts will be engaged to convey key skills to our up and coming script writers so we can expect a new generation of excellence in screen writing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clune also mentioned the importance of training. In the film industry it is necessary to have both theory and, most importantly, on-the-job training. The latter is so important that the engagement of trainees is a condition of qualification for the section 481 scheme. This aspect will be fine-tuned in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and Screen Training Ireland to ensure that the optimum use is made of these opportunities in production, supported by section 481 incentives and by the board.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the need to keep people in Ireland once they have completed their training. While I accept the Deputy's concern, it is essential and advantageous for Irish film makers to gain experience abroad. If we have a strong industry, these people will come back with new resources of knowledge and experience. The biggest difference in the new Ireland is that people can go but they also have the opportunity to return.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clune referred to the importance of documentaries and short digital productions in the context of expanding markets as digital television rolls out. These are two areas in which the film board is active and this activity will increase. The board recently established a scheme called short shorts to provide funding for very short productions aimed at the digital market.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to the importance of county and regional film commissions. The work and development of such commissions will continue. It is important that the best local experience and streamlined co-ordination with local authorities should be available when seeking to identify locations. A number of counties have set up film commissions for this purpose and to provide a one-stop-shop. We would all agree with the importance of this approach as it helps to facilitate a speedy process. Deputy Higgins mentioned the time lag and getting films into production. Facilitating people is a key aspect of getting films into production.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question about the Irish language, tá, ar ndóigh, spéis ar leith agam sa cheist seo.  Ag éirí as an tuarascáil a chuirfear ar bun beidh aird faoi leith á thabhairt ar an ngnó seo agus beidh an Bord Scannán, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus lucht craolachán ag obair le chéile chun dlús a chur leis an obair seo.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of the staffing of the film board. At present the board has ten full-time staff, including the chief executive. A further two people are employed by the Screen Commission of Ireland. In addition, earlier this year two additional posts were created in the business management and development sections of the board. In light of the review of the board's needs which has just been completed, it is intended to create seven key additional posts to <Col N="116" /> enable the board to take on its extended strategic role in developing the industry.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take on board the other point, which is very true in the case of the film board, that it is important in any State board that we get production value for the staff provided. There is no question about this in the case of the film board when one looks at its staffing resources and the work it is doing.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into detail on section 481 but its provisions will run for five years which offers important continuity. The section could not run on a year to year basis and, for that reason, it was decided to operate it for five years. A number of changes to section 481 were suggested but these are budgetary issues on which I will make no further comment.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional moneys for the film board was raised. The Minister is committed to this idea in line with the recommendations of the industry's strategic review group report. This issue will be discussed in the context of Estimates and so on. The Minister is concerned about this issue and will press the case for additional funds.</P>
    <P>The role of the film board is to protect an Irish film industry which would be indigenous and reflect Irish culture and an Irish way of doing things. It is important that we keep this focus in mind and ensure that the board's essential characteristic and purpose is to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The question was asked as to whether funding constituted investment or subsidisation. That is like asking me if I put a pound on a horse whether it is an investment or subsidisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you win some and you lose some. There is a repayment in some cases and not in others. However, there would be no need for this investment if there was a certainty about a project. In the past we tended to be too careful in terms of investment. One of the criticisms of the commercial sector was that it always wanted to bet on guaranteed winners. The idea of the board was to break that vicious circle and ensure that a risk was taken and that money was available to help people take a risk to ensure that productions went ahead. One has to accept that some projects will be winners and some will be losers.</P>
      <P>The board's recoupment figure is 13%. It is hoped to increase this figure but, looking at international experience, there is a limit to the level of recoupment one could expect. We would be aiming to raise the figure to 25% but it would be wrong to see this money as either straight subsidisation or a scheme with a high level of recoupment. It must be accepted that the scheme will not work if one approaches it in either of those ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised other issues related to training. FÁS and the college in Dún Laoghaire are <Col N="117" /> involved in training. Training is obviously very important and we recognise that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank the Deputies who shared their time with me.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, did not explain more fully the background to the scandalous handling of the huge debt of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and the management of that debt, not by officials but by successive Governments over the years. This is so serious that a senior Minister, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, should have come into the House to explain the situation. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in reply to written parliamentary Question No. 100 of 8 June 2000, stated:</P>
      <P>In 1987, when Irish Fertilizer Industries limited was formed from a joint venture between NET and Imperial Chemical Industries plc, . . . NET retained approximately £164 million of its historically-accumulated State-guaranteed debt.</P>
      <P>The reply's last sentence, which I thought was devastating, is:</P>
      <P>From 1987 to the end of NET's financial year in September 1999, NET has paid £188 million in interest on its debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore a debt of £164 million was taken over by a semi-State company in 1987 and in 12 years a staggering £188 million in interest alone was paid on that debt. Questions must be asked and answers must be given in that regard. The debt <Col N="118" /> currently stands at £187.2 million as of 30 September 2000.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, stated in his opening speech that by the 1980s it was clearly recognised that because of the construction cost overruns and operating losses in the early years of the Marino Point plant, the substantial part of the NET debt was a sunk cost which could not be expected to be recovered. I am not acquainted fully with what went on before 1987 or the history of that time, but one sees immediately in this shades of the CIE signalling overrun costs and the shambles which that has turned out to be under the remit of the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, went on to say that NET's primary activity has been the management of its debt portfolio as well as managing a gas contract and monitoring IFI but as a result of the shortfall in the income of NET, the shortfall in interest payments by NET to the banks had to be converted into new State guaranteed borrowings with the result that overall borrowings have continued to grow and have now reached £187.2 million. In other words, only £40 million was paid off the principal since 1987 and another £23 million has been added to the debt accumulated in 1987. That £23 million is to pay the interest on the original debt. Therefore the State has now borrowed money hand over fist to pay interest on the interest. That is an incredible position. I want to put the following question: did nobody cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo; at any stage?</P>
    <P>The banks and the financial institutions have made an incredible bonanza from this semi-State company. All of the big banks are involved here. AIB Bank or its subsidiaries were responsible for £60 million of the debt and the Bank of Ireland for £118 million accumulated at various times since 1987-88. That must mean, if one looks at the interest payments, that the likes of AIB Bank, say on its first tranche of loans of £30 million extended in 1988, must have received about £30 million in interest alone and the bulk of the principal still stands as a debt on the taxpayers. This defies belief. I was amazed that Fine Gael glossed over this and did not examine it in any detail. I want to see what that party has to say about it and I am sure Deputy Rabbitte will have something to say about it also.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder the banks treated the State with contempt in the course of the 1980s and early 1990s with the losses to the taxpayer from bogus non-resident accounts running into hundreds of millions of pounds? Is it any wonder the Ansbacher account holders felt they were above the law when the banks were allowed by the State to rip-off a semi-State company and make an absolute fortune. Unfortunately this is characteristic of the way the semi-State companies have been used. The borrowings of the ESB, for example, total some £554 million and it pays in the region of £45 million in interest each year. This situation should be addressed and should be <Col N="119" /> halted. It is a source of scandal which must be examined.</P>
    <P>This is happening at a time when the Government wants to hand a State-owned bank over to private enterprise instead of bringing more of the banking sector under the democratic control of the State and the consumers in order that this sort of blind robbery of the semi-State sector would not occur and bloat the already massive profits of the banks.</P>
    <P>The usual strategy of the Government is provided for in this Bill also. Privatisation is the answer to everything, as far as the Government is concerned, but what of the 600 workers left in IFI. Arklow has already suffered due to the chaos and anarchy of the marketplace in the 1980s. I do not want to see a single worker lose out but if the company is privatised, there is a serious danger that that may happen. No doubt responsibility for the environment dictates the need for a change from using chemical fertilisers but if the Government was pro-active and imaginative, it could be already making plans and conducting research and development well in advance for the likes of IFI in order to move over to natural fertiliser products. There is a landfill crisis and there is virtually no composting policy in Ireland. Areas like that could be developed by such a semi-State company in order that when the time comes and the wolf is at the door, the workers will not be just thrown on the scrap heap because the market has changed or because they are no longer useful to a particular sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take these questions seriously. For me, this is a source of major scandal. The reasons such a situation was allowed to develop should be explained carefully to the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I would like more time, but I will try to say what I have to say in the little time I have. It is now 16 years since the development farmers were excluded from the additional milk quota. The real failure in addressing this problem lies with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Since the 1997 Supreme Court judgment, the Minister has steadfastly refused to provide compensation to members of the Milk Rights Group who were not party to the Duff case. The current Minister attempted to abandon his responsibility to the nine plaintiffs by fighting them on a case by case basis in the High Court. There is a moral obligation on the Minister to compensate these farmers for past and future losses arising from the mistake of 1984.</P>
      <P>I implore the Minister to come out from behind the defence of the case being statute barred and address the mistakes of the past. I also sincerely hope that every Deputy representing a rural constituency will vote for this motion this evening. We now have the economic prosperity to enable us to address the compensation demands of these people in the Milk Rights Group.</P>
      <P>A recent report by the Kerry IFA states that an alarming crisis is developing in Kerry because young people are leaving farming in droves. The report also states that if this trend continues, there will be a serious shortage of food in the county in the next five to ten years because the farmers will not be there to produce it. Young people are leaving the farm because they are not making a viable income. This is not just the case in Kerry. The story is the same all over the country.</P>
      <P>Why not compensate these farmers and give them a viable income at least? I have met many of the people involved and they are all very hard working genuine people. They are very unfortunate to be in the situation they are in. If they are not compensated, I am concerned that some of them will not be in a position to continue farming and will face a severe crisis in the near future. There should not have been a need for this motion. I hope every TD who has concerns for these unfortunate people will support the motion by voting in favour of it.</P>

      <P>As a small dairy farmer, I know the difficulties these people have. However, I fully support my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, on the way in which he has dealt with the issues raised by the Milk Rights Group to date. Although he inherited a situation not of his own making, he and his officials have listened very carefully and taken seriously the concerns of the Milk Rights Groups. He is, however, forced to balance the demands of this group against the needs of the small to medium sized milk producers and younger producers all of whom are anxious to acquire additional quota in order to develop their farm enterprises.</P>
      <P>Milk quota is a scarce resource and must be used to the best advantage of the industry in general. The Minister has an excellent record and has always consulted widely prior to making changes to the milk quota regime. The Minister has fought hard to retain the quota system for the benefit the dairy farmers. The system has served the dairy industry well in the past bringing market stability to the sector and maintaining incomes at a reasonable level. It has also avoided the fluctuations that take place in many other sectors of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister's efforts in retaining the regime during the Agenda 2000 negotiations last year provided very favourable conditions for Ireland. One of the results of the Agenda 2000 proposals was an increase of 2.86% in our national milk quota and an amendment to the EU regulations in a way which made it possible to make important changes to the management of our milk quota regime. The quota increase amounted to 150 tonnes or 32 million gallons of milk. Some 20.5 million gallons of the increase is available with effect from the current milk marketing year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method used for the distribution of this quota shows the concerns of the Minister for the small scale producers. Some 15 million gallons of this has been allocated to producers with a permanent quota of less than 55,000 gallons and who satisfy certain criteria in the utilisation of their existing quota. Approximately, 21,600 farmers or producers benefited from this allocation. A further five million gallons was made available for the young dairy farmers with a quota of less than 35,000 gallons who satisfied similar criteria but who had obtained specific agricultural education qualifications. More than 3,000 eligible applicants received allocations of up to 1,700 gallons under this scheme. The balance of the 11.5 <Col N="122" /> million gallons will be made available from 1 April 2001.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the price reductions linked to these quota increases under Agenda 2000 proposals will not be effective until 2005. The outcome was a huge improvement on the proposals that faced Ireland at the beginning of these negotiations. The category of producer which has benefited most from these initiatives by the Minister is the small to medium sized dairy producer. Many of the people we are discussing tonight who are involved in the Milk Rights Group would fall into that category. The producers have consistently had priority status in the various schemes operated under the milk quota such as restructuring, temporary leasing and milk quota appeals tribunal. Anyone would argue that what they are getting is what they deserve. They should have favourable consideration throughout the milk quota regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support amendment No. 1. The milk quota regime, as we all know, has been a difficult system since its inception. In his contribution last night, Deputy Dukes questioned the wisdom of such a system of production control. We would all agree with him if this was an ideal world. The situation in the milk market in the early 1980s was, however, far from ideal. We have to assume that Deputy Dukes's party, which was in Government at the time the quota regime was introduced in 1984, considered the system to be a more attractive proposition than alternative routes which might have been followed to deal with the difficult budgetary and market situation that existed at that time.</P>
      <P>The application of such a rigid supply control system in an industry made of individual producers whose situations varied widely inevitably gave rise to serious problems for individual producers and for groups of producers. The category of producers represented by the Milk Rights Group were one such group. As all of us are well aware, the limited availability of quota and the number of producers who need and deserve an increased allocation has made the regime difficult from the beginning. Deputies across the floor are as aware of this as I am. They are also aware that the situation of people in a similar position to those represented by the Milk Rights Group is not something that has just recently come to light &ndash; it is a history going back to when their party was in office.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan never milked a cow in his life, he should shut up.</P>
      <P>All of these situations have been difficult in the past &ndash; we have all faced them. Until the 1980s, quota had not become an issue or a system. The Deputies across the floor are as well aware of this as me. The quota system did not become an issue until the 1980s. The Deputies across the floor are as aware of this as I am. They are also aware that the situation of people in a similar position to those represented by the milk rights group is not something that has just recently come to light. It has been an issue going back to the time the Deputy's party held office.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and his predecessors in this party have over the years devoted an enormous amount of time and energy in attempting to free up the quota regime in order that producers, particularly smaller scale and less well off producers, could acquire, on a permanent or temporary basis, the additional quota they needed to improve their enterprises. In this they have involved the various organisations which represent the industry at producer, processing and advisory level.</P>
      <P>The milk quota restructuring scheme and the temporary leasing scheme are the main mechanisms which were introduced to allow producers to have access to quota without the additional cost of land. These mechanisms, which had first to be negotiated at EU level, have helped many producers over the years, including those following development plans. In addition, the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal was set up to examine and deal with cases of particular hardship under the regime. The tribunal has done outstanding work over the years, something for which its membership should be commended. It continues to enjoy the confidence of the industry in its work. We may all have disagreements about individual cases but, by and large, it dealt very fairly with the cases that came before it. Many deserving producers, including development plan producers, were helped by the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the quota regime has its limitations as a system and presents continuing difficulties for some individual producers, nonetheless the most independent commendations would admit it has brought a significant degree of stability to the sector. It has helped to maintain a reasonable level of income for producers and has avoided the fluctuations which have characterised markets in other agricultural sectors. For those reasons the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development supports its continuation during the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The result which the Minister achieved in those negotiations was very favourable for Ireland. It resulted in a quota increase of 2.86%, the postponement of price reductions until 2005 and the amendment of the quota regulations in a way which allowed <Col N="124" /> important changes to be made in the management of the quota regime in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The objective of these changes was to allow committed active producers access to additional quota at a reasonable cost. This will enable them to plan for the future and continue to operate their enterprises in a competitive manner. While this is important now, it will become more important in the future in an increasingly competitive environment, both within the EU and in world markets. The World Trade Organisation negotiations, the enlargement of the EU to the east and the tight budgetary situation within the Union will all be major factors impinging on the sector in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The changes introduced by the Minister, which followed very wide consultations with all parties involved in the industry and, in particular, the Milk Quota Review Group, should bring considerable benefits to the industry as a whole. As with any worthwhile changes, these were not put in place without a degree of difficulty. This was inevitable in that what was involved was, in reality, a transition from one type of regime to another. It is clear, however, even at this early stage, that the transition has been very satisfactory. This is reflected in the volume of permanent quota transferred to active producers, most of them in the small and medium size categories. The success of the changes has been widely welcomed throughout the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister's record in handling the milk quota regime speaks for itself. It has involved at all stages consultation at the widest level throughout the industry. His commitment to producers, in particular to less well off producers, cannot be questioned. The changes he has introduced have been much more far reaching since the introduction of the milk quota regime. They have taken courage to initiate and see through the changes, but the Minister was prepared to take the decisions involved in the clear knowledge that they served the best interests of the industry, not just for the present but, more particularly, for the future.</P>
      <P>In relation to development plan farmers, the position is complex and there are no ready or simple solutions. It is easy for the Opposition to call for solutions about which they might not be so enthusiastic if the decision or any consequences lay with them. The Minister outlined the position in considerable detail here last night and indicated a course of action which he proposed to consider.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Aylward.</P>
      <P>As outlined by speakers last night and tonight, this is a very difficult and complex issue. Many of the farmers affected by the regulations were working to an advisory plan drawn up by the then advisory service, ACOT. Most of them were hard working progressive farmers who set about increasing their herd numbers, particularly their dairy herd numbers, improving milk yields and achieving particular targets. Obviously their farm development plans necessitated substantial borrowings but the introduction of the milk quota 1984 limited their expansion plans and, by doing so, limited the income potential of those farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall speaking at length with one particular farmer in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan who joined the small farm incentive scheme in January 1973. He built up farm acreage and milk quota. In 1979 he changed classification from other high to development category. In the early <Col N="126" /> 1980s, he was participating in the farm modernisation scheme but, subsequently, the potential of his farm plans have never been realised. It has been a struggle since.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement last night that he is prepared to do all he can to try to achieve extra milk quota, as sought in meetings with his Department officials by members of the milk rights group and many other farmers who are not members of the group but have made their own case to the Department and the Minister. I am well aware of the efforts made by the Minister on behalf of our dairy farmers. The recent launch of the new rural development plan demonstrated clearly the Government's commitment to agriculture with a record level of expenditure of £4 billion over the next few years. We all know the milk quota regime is a difficult system to administer. It has created considerable hardship for producers, many of them my constituents. The problem is simple enough and has existed since the introduction of the regime, namely, a limited amount of quota available and many legitimate demands a system such as the quota was of its nature going to be a relatively crude instrument at the outset which would become more refined over time. Naturally this gave rise to difficulties for some individual producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for sharing his time. The Minister has attempted to direct milk quota towards those most in need and he has been very successful in that regard. We know whose actions in the early 1980s are responsible for the difficulty in which we now find ourselves. It was a Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture and several people have held the position of Minister for Agriculture since that time.</P>

      <P>A small dedicated group of people, themselves mainly small farmers, represent 1,200 small farmers who lost out badly as a result of a mistake which was made in the early 1980s and which has never been corrected. These producers entered a plan in good faith and should have been compensated in the years 1979 to 1984. The history of this matter is well known and these people have a legitimate grievance. The principle of equality and fairness is involved and there must now be a meeting of minds, if that is possible. The Minister said he is prepared to examine the various options open to him.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a divergence between what representatives of the milk rights group are saying and the official facts coming from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The figure of £500 million has been bandied about but the milk rights group say the <Col N="127" /> matter could be settled for much less. I realise that the Minister has a very difficult task. Nevertheless it should be possible to compile the necessary data in the Department.</P>
    <P>I commend the milk rights group. For a long time its members have persisted in trying to have a legitimate claim accepted. There will always be those who will try to jump on a bandwagon but we must accept that effort is needed to keep families on the land. It is difficult, even for those with large milk quotas to stay in business. The efforts of dairy farmers and of the milk rights group should be recognised.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to participate in this debate. The most striking aspect of this matter is the blatant and unspeakable hypocrisy of the Fine Gael and Labour parties who have dragged farmers from all over the country to Dublin to see them put on a show with the most obscene cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan" hpid="Mr. D. Moynihan Mr. D. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These problems were created by the Fine Gael and Labour coalition Government in 1984. Since then those parties have done absolutely nothing to address the problem, despite the fact that they have been in Government on several occasions since that time. Leading the cynical bandwagon is Deputy Dukes who not alone was in Government on a number of occasions during the past 17 years but was leader of the Fine Gael Party. Nowhere is there a statement of support or even a phrase giving some comfort to the farmers in this category.</P>
      <P>Following the allocation to Ireland in 1983 we have been dogged by an inadequate quota but the inadequacy of the quota relates to small farmers with between 12 and 17 cows who are desperately trying to eke out a living. The only Minister who has done anything to address those farmers' problem is the present Minister, Deputy Walsh. He fought for additional milk quota under Agenda 2000 and got an allocation for Ireland against all odds. Now Deputy Dukes says he wants to abolish the quota system altogether and leave the big wealthy farmers to mop up the small quota holders. I do not agree with his proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the complex issues involved here but we are also conscious of the Minister's concern for improving the livelihood of the small and medium scale dairy farmer. In all his initiatives he has ensured priority status for the small and medium scale producer and has taken account of the position of other producers who have particular difficulties. Such producers have been dealt with in a sympathetic way in the terms of these schemes because of the Minister's efforts. It must be recognised, however, that the Minister is forced to balance the demands of all groups whether they are small or medium sized producers, young producers or those with particu<Col N="128" /> lar quota difficulties, all of whom are anxious to acquire additional quota in order to develop their enterprises.</P>
    <P>As well as allocating the quotas which form part of the Agenda 2000 proposals to small and medium sized producers, the Minister has made some important changes in the management of the quota system in Ireland to benefit those categories of farmers. In the past the medium scale producers, in particular, found difficulty in acquiring additional permanent quota at a reasonable cost. This was mainly because of the rigid land linked quota which, in many cases, meant that in order to acquire the additional quota needed to build up their enterprises, producers had to take and pay for land they did not need. The new regime, under which the main mechanism for transfer of quota is the restructuring scheme operated at co-op level, has allowed active producers to acquire permanent quota at a reasonable cost and considerably improved the situation of individuals who were dependent on leased quota. These changes have already enabled a significant number of small and medium sized producers to increase their permanent quota. The positive approach by the Minister has helped to build and sustain the industry in the past and will continue to do so in the future but this depends on the efficient and effective use of the quota.</P>
    <P>I understand officials of the Department have met deputations of the milk rights group on four occasions since last April. If anyone will do anything for these people it will be our Minister. He is ultimately responsible for the operation of the regime and his record on this speaks for itself. The Minister's handling of all aspects of the quota regime has been on the basis of what is in the best interest of the industry as a whole. Milk quota is a scarce resource and must be used for the best advantage of the industry. The Minister has an excellent track record in this regard and I have no doubt he will maintain this high level in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met the milk rights group, including representatives from my own constituency. When I put their case to the Minister I was told on numerous occasions that no decision has been taken on the allocation of the additional 11.5 million gallons of quota which will be available from 1 April 2001. No commitments have been made. I ask the Minister to continue his consultations with the industry, particularly with the milk quota review group which represents the various interests in the industry, before a decision is made on the allocation of quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complex and sensitive issue. We are all aware how difficult the situation is and we are conscious of the Minister's concern to improve the livelihoods of small and medium scale dairy farmers. The Minister has shown his commitment in the various initiatives he has taken over the years, such as the annual restructuring scheme, the temporary leasing schemes and the milk quota appeals tribunals. In all these initiatives the <Col N="129" /> Minister has ensured priority status for the small and medium scale producers and taken account of the position of other producers who had particular difficulties. Such producers have been dealt with in a sympathetic way under the terms of these schemes because of the efforts of the Minister. However, it must be recognised that the Minister is forced to balance the demands of all groups, including small to medium sized producers, young producers and those with particular quota difficulties, all of whom are anxious to acquire additional quota to develop their enterprises. Young farmers in particular have put forward a strong case in that regard.</P>
    <P>In addition to allocating quota to small and medium sized producers, which formed part of the Agenda 2000 proposals, the Minister has made some important changes to the management of the quota system to the benefit of these categories of farmer. In the past, small and medium scale producers found difficulty in acquiring additional permanent quota at a reasonable cost. Even at this early stage, it is possible to see the benefits of the new regime. More than 62 million gallons have been made available to active milk producers under this year's restructuring scheme. This is almost equivalent to the total quantity restructured during the first five years.</P>
    <P>It is most important to have the support of the Minister for Finance in this. He introduced a provision whereby the purchase price of milk quota can be written off over a seven year period for tax purposes. This has been most helpful. It is clear the outcome of this year's restructuring scheme, together with future schemes, will have a significant impact on the structure of the dairy industry. This can be seen in a preliminary analysis of the details which show a significant increase in the number of producers with quotas in excess of 35,000 gallons compared to last year. The Minister has been most positive in terms of the part he has played in building and sustaining the industry in the past and he will continue to be so. However, this depends on the efficient and effective use of quota.</P>
    <P>The Minister's record in relation to the Milk Rights Group has also been positive. He has dealt with the group in a straightforward and open manner. He has not, as suggested, hidden behind the Statute of Limitations. He has correctly operated on the advice of the Attorney General. It is the view that no rights have been established on behalf of the group as it did not bring proceedings&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">

      <P>&mdash;and any such proceedings would be barred by the passage of time. Due to the far reaching implications of the matter, it was proper that the Minister's decision in relation to this group was based on the best available legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> The Minister accepted that advice and all interested parties who had, or have since, written to the Minister or his Department have been informed that provision had not been made for any arrangements in relation to any other producers who are not a party to the Duff or other parallel proceedings. Officials from the Department met the Milk Rights Group on a number of occasions and I hope the discussions will continue and the Minister will consult the advisory group.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his work to date and hope he will be able to find a resolution to this issue. The milk quota review group has been successful in the past and I hope the Minister will consult it in an effort to find a resolution to this complex issue.</P>

      <P>It would be fantastic if the Minister decided not to divide the House and supported the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party. It is an open motion which recognises the injustice that was done in the past and that continues to this day. This injustice was done to smaller farmers who were encouraged by the Department to spend money. They did so and many of them could not afford to take court action later. The people in the Visitors Gallery were not dragged here this evening; they came of their own accord to listen to the debate. Thankfully, they can hear what the Members on that side are saying this evening unlike last night when the Minister was mumbling.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister not to divide the House. He should let the people know that this Parliament cares about them and that he will do something positive for them. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine asked the Minister to do something positive. It said that the members of the Milk Rights Group who are current farmers and who can demonstrate that they, like the plaintiffs in the Duff case &ndash; which only arose in 1997 &ndash; suffered loss or damage as a consequence of a mistake in law made by the Minister for Agriculture are morally entitled to compensation for past and future losses or damages. This compensation should be awarded on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis and the Department should not shrink in its moral responsibility by sheltering behind the &ldquo;statute barred&rdquo; defence. This was stated by an all-party committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Fianna Fáil Party were part of that committee and signed up to that statement. It would be wrong and unjust of them to vote against the motion. I call on the Government not to divide the House. The committee also said that members of the Milk Rights Group should not be further penalised because they did not have the financial resources at the time to sue the State for <Col N="131" /> damages or because they were unwilling to incur further potential monetary losses by pursuing the State through the courts. The Minister would do much for democracy tonight if he backed the Fine Gael Party's motion instead of dividing the House. The House should send out a signal that we care for people.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Fleming wrote to the Minister in 1998, he said these farmers have a valid case in law and he urged the Minister not to use the Statute of Limitations as a defence in the case. Will Deputy Fleming vote against the motion tonight and enable the Minister to continue to use that statute? On his first day in the House, Deputy Healy-Rae said he was on a mission to work for the people of south Kerry. He has a chance to work for them tonight by persuading the Government not to divide the House on this matter or by voting for this motion on an issue that is morally just. The Government knows that is the case as do the Government Deputies.</P>
    <P>Writing in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in 1995, when he was the Opposition spokesperson, the Minister alluded to the injustice that was done. However, he now says that he intends to divide the House on the issue. The Minister said last night that there were between 15,000 and 16,000 cases. However, there is no evidence to back up that claim. I understand the number of full-time milk farmers is 29,000. Where is the evidence to back up the Minister's suggestion? Surely it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Minister and the Department to devise a system under which justice can be done. This is all the motion seeks.</P>
    <P>Advice I received from a senior counsel states that the Minister does not have to hide behind the Statute of Limitations in this case. The motion does not suggest any time limit because we want it recognised that an injustice was done and that it must be corrected. Why can the Minister not agree to something that is straightforward and morally right?</P>
    <P>The IFA backs the point made by the Milk Rights Group. It wrote to the Minister and pointed to the Supreme Court decision in March 1997. It stated that it supported the efforts of the Milk Rights Group in that objective. It said it believed all farmers who had suffered the same disadvantages as recognised by the Supreme Court and who could substantiate their claim should receive the same treatment and compensation granted to the first group. This is all the motion seeks. What is wrong with it? Why must the Minister divide the House on the issue?</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague, the former Minister for Education and Science, faced a similar dilemma last year. However, at the last moment, he decided not to divide the House on a Bill put forward by Deputy Shatter and I on the smoking issue on Ash Wednesday. I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to do the same this evening. I ask him to decide not to divide the House on this matter. Many of these farmers are small holders and they need the <Col N="132" /> Government to show them justice and mercy. It is up to the Minister to give a positive signal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Dukes on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. Is the Minister acting according to his own wishes or is he once again acting at the behest of the officials in his Department? It is important to know this because I cannot believe his wish is to continue to deny people justice. It has been established by the Supreme Court in the Duff case that these people are entitled to quota and compensation.</P>
      <P>It is unbelievable that the Minister, coming from an agricultural constituency, is denying that justice has already been established by the courts. He has set himself up as judge, jury and now executioner in so far as he has abandoned these people who have toiled for 18 years to receive justice in this case. It is a life sentence at this stage and he is still denying them justice. In his amendment, the Minister wants the House to accept the position taken by him. If we knew what his position was, truthfully in this case, perhaps it would be easier for us or there would have been no necessity for the Milk Rights Group to request all public representatives to put a case for them when the Minister has continued to deny them that case. There are 1,200 people who, as far back as 1983, simply brought forward a plan to guarantee them a continuance in agriculture off their own initiative. They brought that plan forward under ACOT, now Teagasc. They wanted to invest money in agriculture and as a result of the introduction of the quota they were denied the opportunity of allowing the continuation to develop. Obviously their investment was lost. It is important that it is a simple matter for the Minister because he has at his disposal 12.5 million gallons with which he can adequately satisfy the Milk Rights Group and these 1,200 people, their entitlements and just rights having already been established by the courts.</P>
      <P>It is unclear what support the Minister has even within his own parliamentary party. They were very scarce on the ground last night and there are few here tonight. Did he have to drag them screaming in here to support him and the various other issues, spuriously related to this case, that they have introduced tonight? Will the Minister clearly indicate to the House before we walk up those steps that it is his intention to satisfy the needs of this small group? Furthermore, if the majority of these people were in his constituency in Cork, would we be here or would they have been satisfied before this by a declaration that he would support them and grant them what they were entitled to?</P>

      <P>I support the Fine Gael motion that calls on the Government to provide either the appropriate milk quota or financial compensation to each of the members of the Milk Rights Group based on the outcome of the successful legal proceedings taken by persons in the same situation as far back as 1997. Given the fact that over 100 individual cases have been brought to the courts, it is unacceptable at this stage that the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should hide behind the Statute of Limitations in order to do nothing for those farmers who have been deprived of milk quota. It is equally unacceptable that he should scaremonger members of his party and the Dáil into believing that there are as many as 15,000 to 16,000 farmers in this category when that has not been clearly established by his Department or by the facts from his Department. It can be estimated by the Milk Rights Group themselves and by farm organisations that up to about 1,200 people are directly affected. The members of the Milk Rights Group have been denied justice since 1997 and it is dishonest and dishonourable not to address this injustice simply because too much time has elapsed since that court case and others have been heard.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, through this broad motion which has the support of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, provides the Government backbenchers and Independent Deputies with a way to resolve this milk quota issue once and for all. Those same Deputies have been giving verbal assurances to their constituents that everything would be all right on the day. Now is the time for those Members to make up their minds and to support the Fine Gael motion rather than hiding behind an amendment that the Minister introduced last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that whenever a deadline is imposed on any scheme, there will always be unforeseen difficulties. These farmers in the Milk Rights Group have found an unforeseen difficulty through no fault of theirs. Many farmers and their families have suffered adversely, financially and in human terms, over the past 20 years because they did not have a milk quota of their own as a base to develop their farm enterprise. We all know how difficult it is to get young potential farmers interested in farming, particularly if they do not have a milk quota and how difficult it is to retain farm viability if a milk quota is not attached. I know a number of farmers adversely affected by animal health regulations around the time of the introduction of the milk quota. One farmer, in particular, had the necessary milk quota and cows at the time but because of disease breakdown in 1981, 1982 and 1983, was not in a position to avail to his advantage of the milk quota regime introduced in 1984. Half his milk production was cut due to the disease breakdown <Col N="134" /> in his herd. He was in compliance with the Department regulations of the time with respect to disease but he disqualified himself from an enormous amount of quota because of the obligations he had to the Department of Agriculture. That is not justice either.</P>
    <P>Not enough has been achieved for the category of farmers whose case we are debating. Their sense of injustice has never been addressed. The case of the Milk Rights Group is much different from farmers involved in Mulder cases, for example, because at least those farmers knew they were receiving some money to get out of milk at the time and through the Mulder case, they were able to get back in again and obtain quota. The Milk Rights Group have never received either quota or financial compensation. All they have received to date is a mixture of soft talk and inaction. I call on the Fianna Fáil Deputies and the Independent Deputies, in particular, to take their chance tonight to resolve this by voting for the Fine Gael motion. It is a chance to get them off the political hook in view of the commitments they made since the court case of 1997 in the highest court in the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Milk Rights Group are possibly the last remaining group that have been affected by the introduction of the milk quota regime back in 1983 and they have probably one of the few outstanding claims that remain to be fulfilled. I appeal to the Minister to use his commonsense to look on these people as probably the last remaining victims of that system. Whereas the milk quota system perhaps preserved prices, kept the market up and saved it from collapsing at that time, nevertheless, some people whom we represent were victimised by the introduction of the system.</P>
      <P>The precedents in law and otherwise have been laid down both in the Mulder case and in the Duff and others <i>versus</i> the Minister for Agriculture and the Attorney General back in 1997. Also the all-party committee, comprised of members from the Minister's own party, came out very strongly in favour of this group. No doubt they never thought they would be asked to come to the House and vote with their feet. They were obviously playing to the audience and their constituents who were affected. Nevertheless, I am sure they were genuine in what they said at the various meetings of the joint committee on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be difficult for the Minister to provide extra milk quota but these people would be very happy if they were adequately compensated financially. No one in this House would oppose that. There may be difficulties because the Minister might not have the flexibility with milk quota because of the tight regime but he should examine the financial aspect. I appeal to the Minister to take cognisance of all the views expressed in favour of this group over the past three years and not to take their protests and demands lightly. They are a genuine group of <Col N="135" /> people who are trying to survive in farming. They are not here to receive soft treatment. They are here just to survive in farming, to pass it on to the next generation and to receive their entitlement. Other groups have been adequately compensated. These people were not able to take their case through the law courts. If they had I am convinced that any court would have ruled in their favour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion which I support. I regret the Minister's response did not offer any solace to this group. Towards the end of his lengthy speech he offered some vague aspirational hope but the substance of his response was he would not do anything for it. I also regret that, over the past few days, Government backbenchers have been explaining to their constituents and members of this group that they will not support the motion as to do so would take the milk quota from someone else. That might appear to be a cute political tactic but it is rather sad and pathetic. These are the same backbenchers who, in advance of the last general election, were the first to sign the Milk Rights Group's petition and make all kinds of commitments. Now that they have an opportunity to do something they will not take it.</P>
      <P>Colour RGB 255,0,0 I am disappointed at the lack of support for this group by the main farming organisations. Perhaps it is not politically correct to say that but in farming as in politics, there is a choice regarding the spending and allocation of resources. Unfortunately, the main farming organisations are ignoring this group and that is a disgrace. Some of those farming organisations may be represented in the House and I hope they take note of my comments. Members of the group feel very let down by the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>This problem has been with us for some time. Although the Minister's speech last night drifted aimlessly back and forth and did not offer a solution, he is in the unique position of having the money and power to resolve the problem and I hope he will do so. It is pathetic looking at the benches where the so-called power brokers of the Government, the Independent Deputies, sit. Where are they? They had a choice to support this group of farmers but instead they are acting like sheep being led to the slaughter. The fact that they are unwilling to defend their stance is indefensible and I hope it will be recalled by those who depend on them for support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this motion because since last September when I was first approached by the Milk Quota Rights Group I could see the validity of its case. I attended every committee meeting and was in constant communication with 100 members in County Limerick. As a result, I met many people and heard heartrending stories regarding the loss of quota. Many of them will not recover financially <Col N="136" /> and some of them have gone out of milk production. I hope the ICMSA and IFA will take up and continue the crusade on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The Duff case occurred in 1997. The Supreme Court found that they had a rightful case. Surely it is wrong for the Department to exclude the other people and, as the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Browne, said, hide behind the statute barred limitation. Just as originally it was found proper, is it not now proper to ensure these people are looked after? Deputy Browne had the unanimous support of the all-party committee, which includes members of the Government party, and, as I listened to the speeches last night, I wondered how they could reconcile them with the statements they made at that committee.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne stated in a letter: &ldquo;As the Department is responsible for the original error it is a matter for it, in consultation with the damaged parties, to assess which of the above options are most appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Various options were mentioned in the letter and I am sure the Minister has a copy. The letter pointed out it is not acceptable to the committee that this obligation should, in any way, be shirked by the employment of legal stratagems, including the defence of statute barred. Such a strategy, applied to those farmers who are in the same position as the plaintiffs in the Duff case, who were eventually vindicated by the Supreme Court, can only lead to further public cynicism concerning the practice of politics. This was written by a member of the Minister's party, the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Browne, in support of the committee's sentiments.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to the chairman and secretary of the Milk Quota Rights Group on this issue on many occasions in the past year. I have also spoken to many constituents who have been affected. This is a genuine case. With the allocation of quota coming up, the Minister has an excellent opportunity. Another suggestion in the letter was that the Minister should ring-fence a section of that quota for members of the group. The Department has stated that over 13,000 members may be affected. It is interesting to note that the group has publicised the matter on many occasions and the number has remained consistent. The Department had since last September to trawl through its records if it wanted to positively establish the number of farmers affected but it did not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>)<b>:</b> I compliment Deputy Dukes on raising this issue and I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on it. It is strange that the matter has dragged on for so long. Without repeating what has been said, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs had a legitimate expectation that the Minister would honour his commitment to them to develop their holdings by exercising his discretion in granting them quota. They had a formula and, based on it, the claims of seven of the eight plaintiffs in the Duff case have since been assessed. The Department has <Col N="137" /> received all the modernisation plans from the local offices and it should be simple to work out a formula for those who are in almost the same position, except they were not involved in a court case, without putting them to more expense. They have suffered enough. The plans they had to develop their farms have gone astray and there were costs involved in going to court.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister can hear me as he is talking but will he say why he is making it more difficult for those farmers who have been told by the Supreme Court they are entitled to compensation? I ask the Minister to resolve this matter and devise a formula whereby legitimate claims, which are there to be seen, can be settled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to support the well-intentioned motion tabled by Deputy Dukes and members of Fine Gael. The reason for it is to redress a serious wrong, an injustice that is being perpetrated on over 1,000 of these farmers and countless others across the country. On 31 March 1998 there were 36 farming families in the Milk Rights Group in Laois and 34 farming families in the same group in Offaly. A serious injustice has been done to those families by the Government and that is wrong.</P>
      <P>This situation arose when the milk quota system was established. At that time a number of farmers had development plans but because of animal disease problems on farms, they were not engaged in milk production when the quotas were being considered and they were excluded. Quota systems can be unfair. Many farmers suffered adversely because of what happened in the allocation of milk quotas. Fair play and common sense are required. The Government has a responsibility to be fair and an obligation to protect the rights of individuals.</P>
      <P>Farmers were compelled to go to court in the Mulder and Duff cases. However, many farmers did not have the finance to bring a case to court. The group which brought the cases to court felt that once it had established its rights, the Government would be fair and reasonable, would recognise that an injustice had been done and would give compensation or milk quotas to these farmers.</P>
      <P>I have a letter from an eminent senior counsel, Gerard W. Hogan, which I will give to the Minister. It states: </P>
      <P>The position regarding development farmers is that they are, in principle, entitled to damages in the light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Duff v. Minister for Agriculture &amp; Food</i> [1997] 2 IR 22. The Minister is, of course, entitled to rely on the Statute of Limitations, 1957 and if the Statute is applicable on the facts of any given case, this would amount to a complete defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear, however, that an action of this kind may be maintained even if otherwise out of time, so that (all other things being <Col N="138" /> equal) a court could &ndash; and would &ndash; proceed to give judgment against the Minister unless he elected to raise the Statute of Limitations defence by means of a positive plea in his defence. Accordingly, as a matter of strict law, the Minister need not plead the Statue and should he not do so, the action would proceed in the ordinary way. Indeed, having regard to the undeniable merits of the development farmers cases, it might be argued from the standpoint of abstract fairness, morality, etc., the Minister ought not to plead the Statute. However, this is solely a decision for the Minister to make. Should he elect to plead the Statue and should the courts rule that the action was statute-barred, that would be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister listens to the people who travelled here tonight from across the country. He must ensure they are given fair play. Otherwise, this House will go against what has been sought and what a committee recommended should be paid. The Minister should ensure these farmers are paid.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the perception Deputy Bradford has of the farming organisations. During his time in office the Minister has brought a dynamic to the milk quota regime which has raised and continues to raise the standard of living of dairy farmers, particularly those with small and medium sized enterprises. Although he is constrained by a rigid quota regime, a point accepted by the Deputies opposite last night, he has made impressive progress because his strategy for the development of the industry is built on his concern for the smaller scale committed producer and a partnership with all the actors involved in the industry.</P>
      <P>His initiatives in the past year alone show his capacity for making the industry succeed within the constraints of the quota regime. This view is shared by the industry and was recognised as recently as yesterday by the Milk Quota Review Group which is representative of all the actors within the milk industry, including the farming organisations. His success has been built on recognition that significant progress is made through partnership with the industry and so ensuring that the scarce resource, milk quota, is used to the optimal advantage of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is also concerned with the need to put the industry on a firm footing for the future. The key to future success must be that the industry remains competitive. His strategy for this is sim<Col N="139" /> ple but extremely effective. He wants to put the quota in the hands of those who want to make a future in dairying and who are hungry for success in agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Minister's actions over the years have raised the standard of living of the small scale committed dairy farmers by giving them priority access to quota. He has done this by giving priority access to additional quota to small and medium scale producers in the restructuring schemes and the temporary leasing schemes and with allocations from the milk quota appeals tribunal.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months alone his success has been outstanding. Two examples will be sufficient to illustrate this. First, he has overseen the allocation of 20 million gallons of the 32 million gallons which he secured under the Agenda 2000 negotiations. This was targeted at the small to medium scale committed producers and younger farmers. Many of these would have received 2,390 gallons as successful applicants under the 15 million gallon scheme and the five million gallon scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew west Cork radio would tune in. Second, the Minister increased the pool of quota available for purchase by producers this year to more than 62 million gallons. This was the result of the changes he introduced in April to the management of the regime in Ireland. His actions in this and other areas have increased the size of the average quota from 32,000 gallons in 1997 to 40,000 gallons today. Approximately 90% of the quota allocated under the restructuring scheme and the temporary leasing scheme this year has gone to small and medium scale producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By removing the rigid link with land in the <Col N="140" /> transfer of milk quota, the Minister has made it possible for producers to expand their enterprises now and in the future without the need to purchase additional land. This increases significantly their competitive edge. It is clear the Minister, while open to look at the concerns of the Milk Rights Group, can only work within the fixed amount of quota allocated to Ireland. As the Minister said last night, the Statute of Limitations must be presumed to have been enacted by the Oireachtas for the common good and the Government in dealing with cases, such as this, must have regard not just to the situation of the persons involved but to that of the general taxpayer on whom the cost of every settlement would ultimately fall.</P>
    <P>The Minister already set out the possible costs involved but they bear repeating in view of the possible consequences. The Milk Rights Group estimated compensation of £40 million to £50 million in addition to eight million to 10 million gallons of quota. That refers only to the 1,200 or 1,300 farmers in the group. There are, however, many other farmers who were in the farm modernisation scheme or rescue package in 1984 and who had dairying plans. These could number between 15,000 and 16,000. If all these cases were to come forward, additional quota amounting to 40 million gallons could be involved as well as compensation approaching £500 million, if we take the cases already adjudicated by the court as a model. While these figures may appear to be high, they represent only 23% of active producers at that time. It is impossible, therefore, to say how many other cases would come forward.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said last night, a number of meetings have been held over the past 18 months between the Milk Rights Group and Department officials at the request of the group and on a &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; basis. At the most recent meeting on 27 April the group's representatives confirmed that their objective was to secure extra milk quota for their members and suggested that this might be met out of the additional quota which the Minister secured for this country as an outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
    <P>The amount of milk quota for Ireland is, unfortunately, finite and this means that allocating it to one group means that somebody else loses out. It is also the case that the State cannot take on legal responsibilities where they do not exist. However, the Minister in the spirit of consensus, which has been the hallmark of his stewardship of the milk quota regime, and despite the fact that there is no legal obligation to go further towards meeting the demands similar to those represented by the group in question, is prepared to look at what can be done in the context of the additional quota which will become available on 1 April 2001. As the Minister said, and I must repeat, this possibility is without legal prejudice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan's party was in Government for three and a half years, but it did not do much. I am delighted that the new spokesperson on agriculture in the Fine Gael Party had to travel to north Cork to scrape the bottom of the barrel to get an issue. There was nothing else left. The Opposition is bankrupt of ideas.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies to support the amendment to the motion in the knowledge that the concerns of this group will be carefully looked at, having regard to the legal implications and taking account also of the need for other producers, especially small and medium scale dairy farmers, to continue the development of their enterprises.</P>

      <P>It is appalling to hear the Minister of State refer to these farmers as being the bottom of the barrel. I hope he will apologise for the insult he has directed at people not only from my constituency but from his own and other constituencies. The only thing missing from the debate is justice. We have heard repeated excuses, yet there has been no reference to the justness of the cause.</P>
      <P>The facts of the case are clear. Under the farm modernisation scheme plans were drawn up by Teagasc to encourage farmers to buy milk quota and improve their farms. These plans were adopted by farmers at considerable expense. The rationale behind this was to bring those with small holdings and a small amount of quota in line with the average industrial wage at the time. Clear promises were made in relation to quota and these were never fulfilled. Many farmers who had borrowed heavily to facilitate these improvements were left high and dry in times of high interest rates and very low margins, profits and income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present 1,200 farmers are involved in a 17 year battle to compensate for losses incurred through what was no fault of their own. We heard again what the Minister has said over the past three years. The Government is relying on a technicality to deny compensation to these citizens. The Minister continues to hide behind the Attorney General on this matter. Those farmers who fought the court battle and were successful secured a ruling from the courts to the effect that they had been treated unfairly and that they were entitled to compensation. The only difference between the successful group and their unsuccessful colleagues is that members of the Milk Rights <Col N="143" /> Group are debarred from seeking redress because of the Statute of Limitations. That point is conceded by all Members.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was either just or fair he would concede the point and allocate quotas to these farmers. He is better placed to do that than any of his predecessors in that he now has quota and money to distribute. Every day on the national airwaves the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance tell us the country is awash with money. There is money for everybody, but not for these farmers who were encouraged by Government agencies to raise large sums of money through high borrowings in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate the difficult road travelled by those farmers who were sufficiently lucky to be on the right side of the court judgment and who were able to achieve the compensation. A labyrinth of court actions, both at home and in Europe, ultimately gave rise to a measure of success. Others with the same grievance did not, for one reason or another, have the wherewithal to pay for court action. That compounds the grave injustice they have suffered.</P>
    <P>There are many members of the Milk Rights Group in my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly and elsewhere. Others outside the group may have a genuine case. They are entitled not only to a fair hearing but to a just solution. Their case must also be heard.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the argument is that farmers who were members of the Milk Rights Group were actively encouraged by Government in the 1980s to fund elaborate infrastructural development on their farms, found only when the work was done and the money borrowed that their source of income was aborted. Livelihoods were damaged, some irreparably. As a democratic assembly of the people, this Dáil can remedy the grievance by instructing the Minister to act in a fair and reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you will shortly ask Members to vote on this issue. Deputy Healy-Rae has been loud on this issue in his constituency. He has the opportunity to force the hand of the Minister if he joins Members on this side of the House in instructing him to take appropriate and reasonable action. I hope he does.</P>
    <P>The stance taken by the Minister is untenable. Having regard to the decision of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where members of the Minister's party agreed a process of compensation or quota to be allocated to the farmers, the Minister has failed to acknowledge the views of his party backbenchers. He has also failed to concede the case and compensate the farmers. I ask Deputies opposite from a farming background &ndash; Deputies Johnny Brady and Michael Ahern and others &ndash; to force the hand of the Minister and ensure a just and equitable resolution to this problem that has been ongoing for far too long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Dukes for introducing the motion, which deals with justice for members of the Milk Rights Group who deserve the same treatment from the State as those who had the resources to take the State to court to vindicate their rights. The motion deals with equity. The Constitution provides that all our people should be treated equally. There was elation two weeks ago following the bringing in to force the terms of the Equal Status Act. We are now seeking equality of treatment for farmers deprived of quota by the State which was lawfully due to them. If the Government is serious about justice and equality for the Milk Rights Group, it will provide either an appropriate milk quota or financial compensation to each member of the group, based on the outcome of the successful legal proceedings taken by people in the same circumstances as the members of the group in the case of Duff <i>v.</i> the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>The group's members were encouraged and advised by agents of the Department and acted in good faith on the advice provided by ACOT in regard to the farm modernisation scheme. This resulted in members making substantial financial and personal investments which could only be economically justified where targets under the relevant farm plans were achieved. This has caused financial hardship and stress to the farmers concerned and was neither just nor fair.</P>
      <P>The quality of life of these farmers and their families has been severely affected and the discrimination should be ended once and for all by the Minister. The targets outlined in the farm plans could not be realised, through no fault of the farmers concerned. Their plans and ambitions for their enterprises were destroyed and the loss and damage they suffered were directly attributable to the Department because of the system used to introduce and implement the milk quota regulations. The pool of milk which should have been provided to development farmers as a legal right to allow them to meet their plan targets was allocated to other farmers. The Minister now has an opportunity to rectify this and ensure that the members of the group are treated justly as equals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have suffered loss, damage, frustration and personal stress for the past 15 years due to the 1984 decision. In 1997, the Supreme Court held that the successful plaintiffs were entitled to more farm compensation from the State in all circumstances and further held that the case should be submitted to the High Court for the assessment of damages. The Milk Rights Group must be treated in an equal fashion. There is a fundamental moral and legal principle that equals should be treated equally. It is unjust, unfair and discriminatory that the Minister, who has indicated his intention to rely on the Statute of Limitations, will not do this, thereby depriving these farmers of their legitimate claims for redress. This is a discriminatory legal defence which the Minister can waive and I call on him to do so. It is not right to use this discretionary approach to deprive <Col N="145" /> the farmers concerned of the compensation to which they are entitled from the State.</P>
    <P>The justice of this case requires that appropriate milk quota or financial compensation be provided forthwith to all members of the Milk Rights Group. The Exchequer can afford to do this. I do not accept the Minister's amendment to the effect that his response is appropriate in the circumstances. It is not.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he had consulted the various social partners, specifically the milk quota review group, in arriving at a decision. It is incumbent on the Minister to provide the House with details of this advice. He also stated that he would have regard to the views of the Attorney General but we can all predict what that will be &ndash; the invocation of the &ldquo;statute barred&rdquo; defence.</P>

I met 120 people, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, farmers who know beyond any shadow of a doubt that an injustice has been done to them and who now have the misfortune to have to wait for the Minister of State and his ilk, with their sneering contempt, to do something for them. I did not think I would ever see the day when I would use those words to describe a junior Minister in a Fianna Fáil Government. I do not like having to use that kind of language in politics but, by God, the Minister of State deserves it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline one incontrovertible fact which cannot be denied by the Minister, the Minister of State or the whinging Fianna Fáil backbenchers who were lashed into the Chamber. The Supreme Court has ruled that people in the same situation as the members of the Milk Rights Group are entitled to compensation and have been for the past 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister came into the House last night and spoke about schemes and about law. Not once in the course of a 30 minute contribution <Col N="146" /> did he use the words &ldquo;justice&rdquo; or &ldquo;equity&rdquo;. That is a pity and a disgrace in a Government which has money pouring out its ears. If it is law the Minister wants, where better to get it than the Supreme Court? Where better to get an interpretation of law than the Supreme Court? Where better to go to vindicate people's rights? The Minister and everyone on the Fianna Fáil benches know that as well as I do. If there was any possible room for doubt in the Minister's mind, Deputy Enright stated earlier that the only defence on which the Minister relies, namely the principle of an issue being statute barred, is not one which he must plead and is one which he has no reason to hide behind.</P>
    <P>There is a way to deal with this problem. The Minister spoke about schemes from 1983 onwards which were introduced to repair various elements of the milk quota system. All of those schemes have one thing in common; not a single one was designed to do anything to rectify the problem which is the subject of this evening's debate. It required an action in the Supreme Court in the not too distant past to establish where right, equity and justice lie in this matter and the Minister should note the outcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that this issue could lead to all manner of unforeseen consequences. The Minister has a problem for every solution but it is time he started looking for solutions to problems. It is nonsensical of him to come into this House and state that if he takes the kind of action he has been requested to take to provide compensation for this group of people, whose grievance is well defined, it could create problems. It is nonsensical for the Minister to state that he cannot deal with this issue because it might lead to unforeseen consequences. The Minister is well aware, as is every other agriculture Minister in the EU, that if one wants to deal with a specific problem, one finds a way of ring-fencing it. I invite the Minister to find a way to resolve this problem which will ensure that the solution will be directed at the target group and not attract in other people. Even if that were to happen, it would not be on the scale which the Minister pretended it would.</P>
    <P>It is time to start seeking a resolution for this problem. The Minister is well aware that this can be done and if he requires any further evidence of that, he should look back at the various schemes he has introduced and the various modifications he has made to the milk quota system. They also have in common the fact that they have all been ring-fenced and specifically designed to deal with a specific problem encountered by a specific group of people, and that is all we are asking the Minister to do this time. The Minister should do the decent thing and deny the dreadful Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, as he did on the issue of the certificate of farming. We ask the Minister to withdraw the amendment and do the decent thing for people who have waited far too long for justice.</P>

      <P>This is not a matter of party politics. I want to plead with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, on behalf of the people in my home town, Enniscorthy. RTE gave little or no coverage to the situation there but I want to give the House a sense of the continuing desperate situation and the hardship and misery which people must still endure.</P>
      <P>On the Monday night of the flood, one could only see the aerials of the cars on Enniscorthy's Templeshannon Quay, which is on the main N11 route. The cars themselves were completely covered. I have seen buildings which contained 12 feet of water. There have not been such floods since November 1965.</P>
      <P>I will outline a couple of housing cases. Just off Scaralwalsh, some £25,000 worth of damage was done to the home of a young couple, who have been living there for only a year. They are still not back in their house. They had to get out in the middle of the night through a window.</P>
      <P>One could go through streets in Enniscorthy where there is nothing to be seen except skips outside houses full of furniture, televisions, fridges and carpets, all of which are completely destroyed. The majority of the people do not have insurance.</P>
      <P>St. John's Business Park, which houses eight small business, is completely flooded. This is serious devastation. An instant appraisal by the engineering staff of Wexford County Council shows that £493,000 worth of damage was done to roads, bridges, footpaths, walkways beside the River Slaney, etc.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday a single man came to my clinic and he was put up in temporary accommodation in a bed and breakfast but he died from a heart attack on Monday. There are elderly people who will not recover.</P>
      <P>Two business people on Templeshannon Quay in Enniscorthy vowed they will not be able to re-open their businesses.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to address the problems of householders and small businesses and to provide compensation for the structural damage caused. I appeal to him to speak to his colleague, Deputy Browne, who will give him a first hand account of the devastation. Since I entered public life in 1979, I have not seen anything like the devastation involved.</P>
      <P>Today I received the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen. I ask him to circulate the address and telephone to which I can refer these cases because his statement does not give these. Will he state the total amount of money available and the type of details which people must give in their submissions in terms of photographs, cost of losses incurred, etc.?</P>
      <P>Invariably these people do not have insurance. Is the relief available to householders only or will it cover small businesses which can provide records? I know of two small companies facing liquidation. This is no exaggeration.</P>
      <P>One farmer had a tank built for a slatted unit. It rose with the level of the water and it will take £25,000 to repair it. I am told there is no agricultural scheme of compensation to cover this.</P>
      <P>There is no set profile in these cases. They are individual cases of considerable verifiable loss. What is the maximum sum available to an individual? Will there be a right of appeal? When will the money come on stream and how will it be spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the local authorities are not the responsibility of the Minister of State, but has the Government also agreed that the local authorities will be reimbursed for expenditure incurred on repairs? There are entire surfaces of bridges <Col N="153" /> which have been destroyed completely. In addition, how long will the bed and breakfast cover last for people who are still out of their homes?</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all the emergency services, the Civil Defence, Garda, fire brigade and local authority services, who resolved the immediate problem of evacuation but the misery will take months to resolve. I visited houses awash not with water but with sewage and the smell of it will be there for months. The distress is indescribable.</P>
    <P>I am making a plea from the heart that these people will be treated with compassion, flexibility and generosity. The reason I raise this is to try and get more information than that contained in the Minister of State's press release today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be in the House to outline the Government's response to the recent flooding. I commiserate with all those who suffered damage or loss from the recent flooding. I appreciate that in many instances such as those outlined by Deputy Yates here and by my colleague Deputy Browne, to whom the Deputy referred, who has obviously contacted me at first hand, the effects have been devastating. Many people have found themselves in severe financial and mental distress and have nowhere to turn for assistance. The Government quickly recognised that action was needed and decided yesterday that a scheme of humanitarian assistance to relieve the hardship should be put in place.</P>
      <P>Officials from my office today met the Irish Red Cross Society and I am delighted to confirm the society has agreed to administer this scheme on behalf of the Government. The Irish Red Cross Society is the independent intermediary body which had the responsibility for the distribution of State and European Commission Aid in 1995 and 1996.</P>
      <P>The Society will place advertisements in the national newspapers early next week seeking applications from those who suffered severe hardship as a result of the recent floods. Deputy Yates asked for the address to which people may respond and this will be in the advertisement to which I refer but I will circulate it immediately to the entire membership of the Dáil and Seanad when I get it on Monday.</P>
      <P>The criteria to be used by the Irish Red Cross Society in determining eligibility for assistance will be similar to previous schemes, that is, death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to home, loss of income and extreme hardship.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that we are talking here tonight about humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship and not compensation for losses. I hope that applications for assistance from those eligible will be forwarded to the Irish Red Cross Society as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On receipt of the application forms, the Irish <Col N="154" /> Red Cross Society will prepare a preliminary report for the Government who will then decide on the amount of funding necessary. To respond to Deputy Yates on this point, I am not prejudging the applications for assistance. I obviously want to get the assessments done as quickly as possible to see the level of funding which will be required.</P>
    <P>Each application will be researched independently as was the case in 1996 and, while I realise this project cannot be completed overnight having regard to the extent and scale of the recent flooding, I hope the assessment can be carried out as soon as possible. Like all Members of the House, I want to see all cases of extreme hardship cleared up without undue delay.</P>
    <P>I understand my colleague in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, received reports from local authorities, including information relating to their emergency response to the flooding. While the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is generally satisfied with the response, he proposes to convene the Interdepartmental Advisory Committee on Major Emergencies to review the reports received and to identify any improvements which might be made for the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing, householders would normally be expected to have buildings and contents insured against losses of this nature. Local authorities may assist through the provision of temporary accommodation and I understand from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, that in this instance such accommodation was and is still being provided. In necessitous cases, it is open to the health board to assist a household, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, where an urgent need arises and in at least two areas, this scheme was availed of on this occasion.</P>
    <P>In terms of repairing long-term damage to housing, there is a number of targeted options currently available to assist vulnerable groups such as lower income households and elderly persons to secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the essential repairs grant scheme, improvement works in lieu of local authority housing and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly. The resources available for these schemes have been substantially increased in recent years.</P>
    <P>The provision of funding for national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority which has statutory responsibility for the management of the national road network, including the allocation of grants. It would, therefore, be a matter for the authority to address any works necessary on national roads in consultation with the relevant road authority.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are responsible for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads <Col N="155" /> and bridges in their areas, the cost of which are financed from their own resources supplemented by State grants. I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is in regular contact with local authority engineering staff in relation to all matters affecting the non-national roads network. Such contacts will continue and any structural damage caused to roads or bridges arising from the recent severe weather conditions will be dealt with in this context.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cancer Screening Programme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise an important question as to why half the female population has been excluded from the breast check programme. I raise this issue as a result of a question I tabled to the Minister for Health and Children on 24 October when I asked why there was no breast screening programme at Cork University Hospital. I was told by the Minister that his Department had received no submission from Cork University Hospital which, in ways, was a very misleading statement in that on checking the facts, I learned that the Minister had announced some time previously with glossy folders and brochures, the launch of the national breast screening programme.</P>
      <P>When I heard of a national programme, I presumed it was truly national and that all parts of the country were being covered. It is obvious from the Minister's response that women who do not live within the Eastern Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board and Midland Health Board areas and who may be in the early stages of breast cancer, will not be screened. One of the leaflets I saw produced at the launch contained the question, &ldquo;How do I get a breast screening appointment?&rdquo;. It did not give the answer, of course, that if one lives outside the Eastern Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board or the Midland Health Board areas, one simply does not get a check or an appointment. The next obvious question that came to me was that if one cannot get an appointment, when can one expect to get one if one happens to live in Donegal, Cork, Limerick or Galway? The answer is that nobody has a clue &ndash; it could be a short or long time depending on when areas outside those already mentioned are included in phase two or phase three.</P>
      <P>On carefully inspecting the documentation relating to the national scheme, there is no definite commitment as to when phase two or phase three will be implemented. My concern is that it took ten years to progress the commencement of the pilot scheme in Eccles Street, the phase one. Will it be another ten years until we have phase two and a further ten years before we have phase three? Irish women and Deputies are entitled to a straight answer to a straight question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> On what basis was the decision taken to carry out screening in the Midland Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board and the Eastern Health Board areas and to exclude other major urban areas such as Cork, Limerick and Galway? The women to whom I have spoken would like to know the answer. I would like to know the reasons behind this discrimination and whether decisions are made on political rather than on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed by the Minister, the Department and those operating the screening programme that a 20% reduction in mortality from breast cancer can be achieved by this programme. What does this mean? It means in the crudest terms, and if the figures are correct, that women with breast cancer outside the screening areas can expect to die in one fifth greater numbers than women inside the screening areas. Until such time as screening is finally extended to all the country, the so-called national screening programme is failing approximately half the women in this country by failing to offer them not merely screening, but even a firm timetable for screening.</P>
    <P>If the organisers of breast check truly believe they can reduce deaths from breast cancer by 20%, then why are 20% of women with breast cancer outside the limits of certain health board areas being effectively condemned to death? Who is playing God in this case? At a time of plenty, the money for a proper national programme is surely there. National programmes should mean national and should not be piecemeal and callous. I would like to get some straight answers to the questions I put. I would also like to compliment Dr. Simon Mills of the<i> Irish Medical Times</i> for raising this important issue in that publication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the programme. The planning process to initiate a national breast screening programme commenced in March 1997 when the then Minister for Health and Children, at the launch of the National Cancer Strategy Action Plan, established a steering group and quality assurance committee to oversee and develop an implementation plan for a national breast screening programme. One of the first decisions taken was that implementation should be on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase one of the National Breast Screening Programme will involve screening women aged 50 to 64 years in the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas. The target population is approximately 140,000 and represents approximately 50% of the total national target population. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved <Col N="157" /> in the screening process rather than the costs involved and the Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the unnecessary trauma and anguish that could be caused to women and their families as a result of mistakes in an organised screening programme. For this reason the National Breast Screening Programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice. Specifically, the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>At this stage, the screening age is limited to women between 50 and 64 years, but it is anticipated that, when the programme is sufficiently developed, consideration would be given to including older women and continuing screening of women already in the programme who have reached 65 years. Screening by mammography under the age of 50 remains unproven in terms of reduction in mortality.</P>
    <P>The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles St. unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of free mobile units. The Eccles unit commenced screening under the programme last February. Screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital and this will be expanded once construction of the new Merrion unit is complete. The first mobile unit commenced screening on 21 August 2000 in Longford.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase one of the programme in place. The steering committee has recommended that phase two of the programme should follow phase one as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that this is a national programme to which the Minister and I are fully committed and I am confident, from the experience thus far, that the objective of reducing mortality from breast cancer by 20% will be achieved and that early detection will lead to successful treatment for those women who present with the condition. Women are not excluded in other parts of the country. They can avail of other services available on the ground through their GP or by way of referral to out-patient clinics. The Deputy said it was ten years before phase 1 began. As the Minister has given a commitment, and as a good Corkman, I am sure he will have no problem getting phase 2 off the ground on record time. If this was a political decision, I am sure he would have begun in Cork, not in Dublin and the other <Col N="158" /> regions. I agree with the Deputy that it would be nice to have a 20% reduction in cancers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this Adjournment debate is tragic and heartbreaking. Ross Cooney was a bright dedicated student and sportsman. Last November, Ross collapsed during a basketball tournament at the National Arena in Tallaght and, despite the best efforts of the staff at Tallaght Hospital, they failed to resuscitate him.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the jury at the inquest into the death of Ross Cooney called for research into the health effects of stimulant drinks. During the inquest, evidence was given that Ross had consumed between two and three cans of Red Bull in advance of the basketball tournament. No evidence was found that the drink was responsible for Ross Cooney's death. However, the jury made a sensible and reasonable call for research. It is a call I support and I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to indicate that research will be conducted.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a phenomenal growth in energy drink consumption in Ireland. Sales of energy and sports drinks will exceed £100 million this year on the Irish market. This represents an 83% increase since 1997. Zenith International, an independent research consultancy which identifies trends in the drinks market, calculates that energy and sports drinks will account for 15% of all soft drink sales in Ireland this year. Much of this growth can be attributed to energy stimulant drinks which have appeared on the market in recent years.</P>
      <P>It is time there was a balanced analysis of the effect of these drinks. One of the strongest marketing points of stimulant drinks is the amount of caffeine and taurine they contain. Surely it is important to establish upper limits of the safe amounts of these stimulants which a person can consume within a certain period. In addition, does consumption of such significant amounts of stimulants have an effect on a person taking certain prescription drugs? These are just some of the questions which should be examined in a calm and objective fashion. On foot of findings established by such research, manufacturers should be required to include warning or advisory information on the packaging and labelling if the research produces genuine grounds for concern. This is a common practice and advisory information is included on packaging for many health products available over the counter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Food safety is an increasingly important matter of public policy. It is essential that consumers are assured that the food and drink they consume is healthy and safe. A programme of research into stimulant drinks, perhaps co-ordinated with our EU colleagues, would be of immense value. It <Col N="159" /> would be in the interests of both the consumers and manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The Cooney family have endured an insufferable loss. They bravely faced the public and the media interest surrounding the inquest into Ross's death. I sincerely hope the family can now be left in peace to come to terms with the tragedy that befell them. The parents of Ross Cooney have welcomed the jury's recommendation that research be conducted. I hope the Minister of State is in a position to indicate such research will be initiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffat Dr. Moffat">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffat</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>Energy drink is a commercial term used to describe beverages containing stimulants. It is not a recognised drinks category within the European Union. Red Bull contains three active ingredients, caffeine, glucuronolactone and taurine. In 1999, the European Scientific Committee on Food was asked by the European Commission for an opinion on caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone as constituents of so-called energy drinks.</P>
      <P>This committee, which carries out risk assessment on foodstuffs in Europe, reached a number of conclusions in their opinion. These were based on an assumed maximum intake level of 0.5 litre of energy drink per day. They concluded that the contribution of energy drinks to overall caffeine intake is not a matter of concern for non-pregnant adults. Moderation of caffeine intake, from whatever source, is advisable during pregnancy. Substitution of energy drinks for normal beverages by children could lead to increased caffeine levels in this group. This could result in transient behavioural changes such as arousal, irritability, nervousness or anxiety. The interaction of the constituents of energy drinks has not been well studied, nor has the interaction of caffeine and taurine with alcohol, particularly under conditions of exercise and consequent dehydration through sweating. The safety-in-use of taurine and glucuronolactone as delivered in energy drinks has not been established. Further studies will be required. This opinion makes it clear that scientific data was not available to answer all questions about the safety of these energy drinks under all circumstances of usage.  </P>
      <P>It is important that because energy drinks are on sale throughout Europe, their safety is evaluated on a European level. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for the enforcement of food safety law in Ireland and, under current law, energy drinks are legally on sale in this country. I am aware that in the European Commission's White Paper on Safety, there is a proposal to draft legislation controlling foods intended for intense muscular effort. The proposed completion date for this is December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> At this point it is unclear whether this legislation will cover energy drinks like Red Bull or if it would be restricted to more traditional high sugar drinks. I will ensure that my department and the FSAI, when servicing the relevant working group in developing this draft legislation in Brussels, will strive to have this legislation cover such energy drinks.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I assure the House that I, as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, propose, with my relevant colleagues in Government, to continue to actively monitor the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 November, a distress call was picked up at Waterford airport at 11.41 a.m. A 35 year old Welshman, Michael Davis, had fallen overboard from the Stena Link ferry travelling from Rosslare to Fishguard. The incident took place 17 miles off Carnsore Point. The distress signal was picked up by an Air Corps crew of an Alouette helicopter based at Waterford airport. They were anxious to participate in the rescue but were told by the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre not to do so because they had a particularly short range helicopter and did not have aircraft cover.</P>
      <P>This seems incredible. The spokesman for the Marine Rescue Service said that the plane which provides occasional cover is based at Baldonnel and, because the incident happened at the week-end, it would have taken too long to get a crew together to go to the scene with the helicopter. It would have taken the helicopter 25 minutes from Waterford to have reached the man in the water. There is no criticism of the crew of the Sikorsky helicopter which came from Baldonnel, but that journey took one hour and 21 minutes. The man was taken from the water alive and was brought to Wexford General Hospital where he died. The secretary of the Rosslare Harbour Lifeboat Service said he had no doubt if the man had been taken out of the water within 25 minutes of falling in, he would still be alive but the extra 56 minutes meant he did not survive. That is a horrible indictment of the level of service available in the south east.</P>
      <P>We had a terrible tragedy last July when four fine airmen were killed in a Dauphin helicopter at Tramore Strand. It is a disgrace that there has been no meaningful replacement service at Waterford Airport since. The crew in Waterford were confident that they could have saved the man if they had had the proper air cover or the original helicopter. The helicopter they have is not capable of carrying out an all-weather 24 hour rescue service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask that a fully operational 24 hour rescue helicopter service be provided at Waterford Air<Col N="161" /> port. The inquiry into the tragedy in Tramore showed that the proper systems were not in place and because of that, four airmen died. In the recent incident a man died because the helicopter based in Waterford Airport was not adequate to do the job required. Something must be done immediately. I ask that a proper rescue service be put in place.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, regrets he cannot be here to take part in this debate.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, in consultation with the Departments of Defence and Finance has the primary responsibility to set the levels and standards of the air-sea support requirements for search and rescue (SAR). In that context, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources recommended that the south east region be served by an all-weather, night flying helicopter and it remains Deputy Fahey's view that this be reinstated as soon as possible following the loss of the Dauphin in July 1999 with the tragic loss of four Air Corps crewmen.</P>
      <P>Helicopter support for marine emergency response, which includes search and rescue, is provided by the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and Defence.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources provides two Sikorsky 61N helicopters on a 24 hour basis located at Dublin and Shannon airports, managed and operated by the Coast Guard. The S61N is a multi-engined all-weather, medium load carrying helicopter, equipped with autohover, with a declared maximum range, without refuelling, of approximately 230 nautical miles. From September 2001, the Irish Coast Guard helicopter service is being upgraded and from that date, the back-up helicopter will have the same autohover capacity as the other two helicopters.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defence provides an Air Corps Dauphin SA 365F on a 24 hour basis located at Finner Army Camp, County Donegal and an Alouette 111, located at Waterford Airport. The Dauphin is a multi-engined, all-weather, light load carrying helicopter, equipped with autohover and with a declared maximum operating range of 150 nautical miles by day and 75 nautical miles by night. The Alouette 111 is a single-engined helicopter, restricted to off-shore visual contact flight conditions and daylight only and to operations to a maximum of three nautical miles off-shore. As the House is aware, the Alouette is in replacement of the Dauphin which crashed on Tramore beach on 2 July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is very anxious that an all-weather night flying helicopter service is reinstated at Waterford as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> The current deployment is based on the findings of a number of reports prepared over the period 1988 to 1996. While the present coverage is adequate, growing demands both off-shore and on-shore highlight the need to keep capacity and deployment under review.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence announced on 12 July 2000, the first stage of a process to acquire new medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option for a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport. The procurement of the helicopter is by way of a tender competition in accordance with Government contracts procedures and EU directives. The competition is being run in two stages, a request for proposals stage and a request for tenders stage. Six responses to the request for proposals were received in the Department of Defence on 21 September, 2000 and are now being evaluated.</P>
    <P>The deployment of the helicopters will be a matter for consideration closer to delivery time. Obviously the situation at Wateford will have to be addressed as a matter of priority. A working group of the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and Defence has been set up on the subject of dedicated helicopter search and rescue assets. This group will, in tandem with the current tender competition for the supply of medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps, determine the overall helicopter resources required, civil and military, and the optimum deployment of same to cover the Irish search and rescue region. It will identify and make recommendations on the specific Air Corps resources which will have to be committed and deployed to meet those requirements. It will also consider all options &ndash; lease, extension of current contracts etcetera &ndash; for the provision of interim and urgent solutions for the overall requirements, taking into account the lead time for the delivery of new medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps. Therefore, an immediate solution to the inadequate capacity at Waterford will be the priority item to be addressed by the working group.</P>
    <P>In relation to the suitability of the Alouette for marine search and rescue, the review of the adequacy of the marine search and rescue coverage on the east coast, which was published in June 1996 examined, among other matters, the suitability of the Alouette 111 for marine search and rescue and concluded that because of its visual contact flight conditions, daylight only restrictions and range, the Alouette 111 is unsuitable for off-shore marine emergency helicopter cover.</P>
    <P>However, the group acknowledged the multi-role capability of the single engined Air Corps Alouette 111 helicopter was ideally suited for mountain, cliff and close-in marine search and <Col N="163" /> rescue operations conducted by daylight in visual contact flight conditions. The Irish Coast Guard responsibility for search and rescue services cover, in addition to the Irish marine search and rescue region, includes inland rivers, lakes and waterways, the littoral area and cliffs of Ireland and is being extended to solution and remote area rescue.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps for search and rescue is a positive indication of the Government's commitment to <Col N="164" /> the Air Corps and is welcomed by the Coast Guard. The provision of a new multi-engined marine SAR helicopter for the Air Corps with its increased endurance, capability and range will relieve the work load on the Shannon and Dublin helicopters for long range missions, provide back-up for the west coast and provide an opportunity to consider enlarging our marine search and rescue area of responsibility.</P>

      <P>Political agreement was reached at the Employment and Social Affairs Council on 17 October 2000 on the draft Council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. The draft directive prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on grounds of religion or belief, age, disability and sexual orientation. Negotiations on this directive took place over a relatively short period of time and the religion or belief ground was only one of several major outstanding issues which were referred to the council of 17 October, for resolution, in order to allow agreement to be reached on the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the religion or belief ground, an amendment was incorporated into the directive which will ensure that we can maintain the existing provisions in the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which protect the religious ethos of religious, educational and medical institutions, namely, sections 16(4) to (6) and section 37(1) of the Act. The Deputy will be aware that these provisions in the Employment Equality Act gave rise to extensive debate when the Employment Equality Bill, 1996 and the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, were being considered by the Oireachtas. The Deputy will also be aware that the Supreme Court examined these provisions when the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, was referred to it under article 26 of the Constitution and that the Supreme Court found that the provisions in the 1996 Bill, which are now included in the 1998 Act, represented a balance between <Col N="167" /> free expression of religion on the one hand and the right to earn one's living and equality before the law on the other.</P>
    <P>I was not satisfied that the proposed wording in the draft directive submitted to the council on 17 October reflected the balance achieved in Irish legislation. I was concerned that the proposed wording could have meant that institutions based on religion or belief would lose the flexibility in employment practices required in order to maintain their ethos. For example, there could be a situation that in a Protestant school the only teacher who could be required to be of the Protestant religion would be the religion teacher. I am happy that the appropriate balance has now been achieved and that we will be able to maintain our existing provisions in this area.</P>
    <P>In the course of negotiations on the draft directive, Ireland indicated at all times that the provision in relation to religion was a particularly sensitive issue for Ireland, having regard, for example, to the denominational nature of our education system. Similarly other member states highlighted provisions in the directive which created difficulties for them. It is precisely because of the complexity and sensitivity of the directive and the relatively short negotiation period allowed that a number of issues, including the religion issue, fell to the council to resolve. These issues were resolved by the Council of Ministers at the meeting of 17 October 2000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under section 30 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Legal Aid Board has sole responsibility for the provision of services under the Act. The board's responsibility includes the number of solicitor posts that are assigned to each law centre and the filling of any vacancies that arise.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board operates 30 law centres. I am advised by the board that at 1 November 2000, there were seven vacancies, including two part-time vacancies, in its law centres. These vacancies occurred in the law centres at Blanchardstown, a part-time post, Clondalkin, Finglas two vacancies, Gardiner Street, Mount Street and Waterford, a part-time post.</P>
      <P>I understand that during the period since October 1999, eight solicitors have resigned from law centres in the Dublin area while one solicitor was promoted to a law centre outside the Dublin region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have outlined before in the House the three essential components to the Government's zero tolerance &ndash; implementation of the law of the land &ndash; approach to crime. These are a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime; a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime; and a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that never in the history of the State has the Garda Síochána been <Col N="169" /> better resourced or equipped. Garda strength is heading towards 12,000 which will be an all time high.</P>
    <P>When I came into office in 1997, I was facing a situation where almost one in five prisoners were on temporary release. Literally hundreds of prisoners were being released each week because of lack of prison places, to relieve chronic overcrowding, and to maintain order in the prisons. As a direct consequence of my prison building programme, the number on temporary release has plummeted to 7.5% of the prison population in June this year. I am satisfied that the contribution which this has made to reducing indictable crime statistics is clear and irrefutable. As the House is aware crime rates fell again last year by 5% and we have seen a cumulative fall of over 20% since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>My policy for dealing with drugs and organised crime is well known: it is one of strong legislation backed up by tough enforcement to tackle drug dealing and trafficking. This policy has resulted in record drug seizures by An Garda Síochána, with many Irish based drug trafficking organisations being dismantled and major drug barons fleeing abroad with a high percentage of persons who are prosecuted being convicted and sentenced to prison.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to think, however, that I have just focused on the enforcement side of dealing with the crime problem. I am particularly pleased to have placed increased emphasis on measures to reduce youth crime and my Department has invested significantly in preventive measures such as the Garda youth diversion projects. There were just 12 in existence when I took up office in 1997: there are now 51 and funding has been secured for them under the National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>
    <P>Finally, the estimates published by the Government for the year 2000 show that for the first time ever, spending in the Justice area, will exceed £1 billion. As the Deputy will appreciate, this level of investment is unprecedented and will pay dividends in the years to come in the fight against crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>The study to which the Deputy refers which is entitled &ldquo;Lives on Hold: Seeking Asylum in Ireland&rdquo; was recently published by the Social Science Research Centre, University College, Dublin. It is wide ranging and its findings, in so far as they relate to my Department's responsibilities, are being considered.</P>
      <P>The Government places a high priority on maintaining an asylum process which is both fair and transparent and which is geared towards providing protection to those in genuine need of such protection as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also fully committed to the implementation of the 1951 Geneva Convention and this is reflected in both the present administrative procedures for processing asylum applications agreed with the UNHCR and the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 &ndash; as amended. Considerable resources are expended annually to ensure that our procedures are in line with best international practice and the highest standards and the application of these procedures has been affirmed by the courts on several occasions. The staff of the Department also receive comprehensive training, in association with the UNHCR, in the application of the asylum procedures. The Department's procedures include a first instance <Col N="171" /> decision after interview at which every opportunity and assistance is afforded to an applicant to put forward his or her case for refugee status; a right to an appeal which is heard by one of 14 independent appeals authorities; a right to independent legal advice and assistance from the Refugee Legal Service at various stages in the asylum process.</P>
    <P>The asylum application process will be provided with a new statutory framework with the commencement in full of the Refugee Act, 1996 &ndash; as amended &ndash; on Monday next 20 November 2000. This will see the establishment of two new independent offices, namely, the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which will hear and make recommendations, in the case of the tribunal in relation to appeals, on applications for refugee status.</P>
    <P>The study refers to the fact that in 1998 Ireland's total recognition rate, 13%, was lower than for certain other EU member states. The examples of Finland, Denmark and the United Kingdom are specifically referred to in the study. In this regard, it should be noted that Ireland's figures for that year contained very few decisions on leave to remain whereas the numbers recognised in the other three selected member states included a high proportion of decisions to grant leave to remain.</P>
    <P>I would point out that during 1998, in Ireland, refugee status, excluding leave to remain, was granted in 11.2% of cases. This compares with 1.6% in Finland, 13% in Denmark and 20% in the UK which are the countries mentioned in the study. It can also be compared with much lower recognition rates in Germany, 7.9%, Greece 3.8%, Netherlands, 9%, and Spain, 3.9%. As the study points out, the nationality breakdown of asylum applicants in Ireland is different from the rest of Europe. Given that this is the case, there is no reason to assume, even within any nationality, that those applying in Ireland are a representative cross section of applicants of that nationality elsewhere in Europe. It is therefore unsafe to draw any conclusions in relation to our determination process from comparative recognition rates. I am satisfied that with the system in place at present and the system which will be in place, on the full commencement of the Refugee Act, that any applicant in this country who is deserving of refugee status will be given the protection they deserve.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that there should be a review of decisions made on asylum applications, I would reiterate that asylum applications in Ireland are processed in accordance with procedures agreed with the UNHCR and are based on the highest standards of international practice in this field, including the right of appeal to an independent appeals authority. The forthcoming introduction of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, and the establishment of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee <Col N="172" /> Appeals Tribunal will underpin, on a statutory basis, the asylum processing system.</P>

      <P>Although the article referred to by the Deputy does not suggest that children have been trafficked to Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation, the phenomenon of child trafficking is certainly one of considerable concern internationally.</P>
      <P>Irish criminal law provides for a range of offences which help to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. A number of legislative initiatives specifically aimed at the protection of children from sexual exploitation have been taken in recent years. One of the most important was the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, which ensured that persons resident in Ireland could be prosecuted for sexual offences committed against children while abroad.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, makes it an offence to traffic in children for the purpose of their sexual exploitation or to abduct children for that purpose with penalties of up to life imprisonment. It is also an offence to provide accommodation for such a child while in the State. This Act also outlawed the possession, production, distribution, importation, exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography with penalties of up to 14 years imprisonment. This legislation gave effect to one of the most important aspects of the EU Joint Action on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Exploitation of Children and the seriousness of the offences are reflected in the penalties applicable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, came into effect on 5 September 2000. This purpose of this Act is to target the profiteer or professional traffickers in human beings by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and providing a framework by which those engaging in such trafficking can be dealt with under the law.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the legislation available is adequate to deal with the crime of trafficking in children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also happy to inform the House that no incidents of this nature have been recorded by the Garda authorities to date. There is of course no room for complacency on an issue of this gravity, and members of An Garda Síochána liaise with Interpol and Europol to keep up to date <Col N="173" /> with current trends and the <i>modus operandi</i> of the traffickers. In this regard the Garda National Immigration Bureau, which was established in May 2000, has as one of its primary objectives the co-ordination and direction of strategies to combat trafficking in illegal immigrants and the Government has also approved the strengthening of Garda international liaison arrangements by the placing of Garda liaison officers in London and Paris for the purpose of interacting with local law enforcement authorities on immigration and trafficking matters.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be interested to note that on 7 September 2000 the Taoiseach signed the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The protocol imposes substantive obligations on States which are party to it to adopt all measures necessary to prevent child prostitution, child pornography, the abduction, sale and traffic of children and all other forms of exploitation prejudicial to a child.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department has been participating in the work of the UN <i>ad hoc</i> committee on the elaboration of a convention against transnational organised crime which has been considering the elaboration of a protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the main convention. This protocol was agreed at the committee's most recent session in October 2000 and a signing conference for the main convention and its protocols is to be held in Palermo from 12 to 15 December 2000.</P>
    <P>Child sexual abuse is one of the issues under review in an examination of all outstanding issues relevant to the criminal law governing sexual offences which is already under way in my Department. If that examination identifies any further changes that need to be made in the law, I will seek Government approval for such changes.</P>

The decision of the Government will be announced in the usual way in due course.

      <P>There were 356 convicted sex offenders in custody in Irish prisons on the week ending 10 November 2000.</P>
      <P>Public discussion and commentary about the issue of the treatment of sex offenders frequently implies that the dedicated sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill prison is the only form of rehabilitation programme in place for sex offenders in Irish prisons and that it reaches a very limited number of prisoners annually. This is incorrect.</P>
      <P>There are actually four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their offending behaviour.</P>
      <P>The first intervention method is individual counselling from the Department's psychology service and from the Probation and Welfare Service. This is a largely demand-led service to individual prisoners who ask for help.</P>
      <P>The second intervention is a multidisciplinary thinking skills group work programme which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme is in place in Cork prison and Arbour Hill prison since 1998 and has recently been introduced in the Curragh place of detention.</P>
      <P>The third intervention which tends to receive most media coverage is the extremely intensive offence focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill prison and which is delivered by officers of the probation and welfare and psychology services of the Department. This programme can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to eleven months to complete. The emphasis is on accepting personal responsibility for the offence and developing effective relapse prevention strategies for each offender. All convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are held, are invited to apply for inclusion in this programme. A second programme will be introduced in the Curragh place of detention by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The fourth intervention which perhaps deserves greater acknowledgement involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category. This is done on a sessional basis, and a call-out basis as well as in response to particular individual crises.</P>
      <P>Ten prisoners are undertaking the dedicated treatment programme, referred to above, in Arbour Hill prison. While it is not possible to accurately quantify participation, many of the sex offenders in custody at present are availing of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> I have asked the director general of the Irish Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. A working group chaired by the Director General and comprising representatives of all the relevant agencies and prison disciplines is currently overseeing the introduction of a number of interventions for sex offenders in the Curragh place of detention which accommodates approximately 100 sex offenders.</P>
    <P>A thinking skills programme has already been introduced in the Curragh place of detention and, as previously stated, an intensive sex offenders group treatment programme, drawing particularly on successful offender participants in the thinking skills programme will be introduced there before the end of this month.</P>
    <P>A steering group to put in place multidisciplinary prisoner programmes has also been established by the director general of the Prisons Service. This group, chaired by a senior prison governor, comprises representatives from the Department, senior prisons service management, Probation and Welfare Service, psychology service, prisons education and the Prison Officers Association. Its first task will be to oversee the establishment of a new intensive rehabilitative programme for sex offenders. This programme will be delivered by a multidisciplinary team consisting of prison officers, psychologists, probation and welfare staff and teachers. To this end the Irish Prison Service has recruited the services of a research psychologist to assist in the development of this programme. This work is expected to be completed in the new year.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the recent annual conference of the Psychological Society of Ireland in Portumna. Both the thinking skills programme and the dedicated sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill prison were the subject of discussion by the delegates. Independent researchers reported that both programmes were being delivered very effectively and had an measurable impact on the offenders participation. The studies in question are currently being prepared for publication.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective for the Irish Prisons Service is to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than are currently available, to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The latter point about willingness by prisoners convicted of sex offences to co-operate in personal rehabilitation programmes is significant because it is the experience in many prison jurisdictions including Ireland that a significant percentage of prisoners decline the opportunity to partake in this work. Compulsion is not a realistic or indeed legal option in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government approved the setting up of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 9 May 2000. The bureau commenced operations on 23 May 2000 and currently comprises 39 members of the Garda Síochána from the ranks of garda up to chief superintendent. In addition, the complement of clerical support staff has recently been increased from ten to 24 to facilitate the release of Garda personnel who had been engaged in administrative work for operational duties. I can assure the Deputy that any resources which were identified to me by the Garda authorities as being necessary have been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau is responsible for the monitoring and tracking of non-nationals who are the subject of deportation orders; the effective co-ordination of activities leading to the execution of deportation orders; the effective co-ordination of operational strategies and resources from point of entry into the State &ndash; airports, ports and border crossings; the co-ordination and direction of strategies to combat trafficking in illegal immigrants; the strengthening of international liaison arrangements on relevant immigration issues including liaison with <Col N="182" /> Garda liaison officers based abroad; the provision of non-national registration service &ndash; the immigration registration office &ndash; and the enforcement of immigration law generally.</P>
    <P>The bureau has established international liaison arrangements with immigration authorities in both the United Kingdom and France which are major transit points for illegal immigration into the State, with a particular focus on trafficking activity. These arrangements include the placement of permanent liaison officers in the Irish embassies in both London and Paris. The bureau has also been closely involved in the training of immigration officers throughout the State in relation to new procedures which will apply following the commencement of the Refugee Act, 1996, on 20 November 2000. In addition, the opening hours of the immigration registration office in Dublin have been extended in order to cater for the large numbers of non-nationals who are required to register there.</P>
    <P>In the area of deportation, I can inform the Deputy that 22 persons were deported between November 1999, when deportations commenced under the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999, and 23 May 2000 when the Garda National Immigration Bureau was established. Since then, a further 109 persons have been deported representing a significant increase over the previous comparable period.</P>
    <P>I intend to keep the resources necessary for the effective functioning of the Garda National Immigration Bureau under ongoing review in consultation with the Garda Commissioner in light of operational experience gleaned and in the light of trends in illegal immigration and trafficking generally.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice (Location of Victims' Remains) Act, 1999, established a commission for the location of the remains of victims of paramilitary violence. The commission received certain information on the location of the remains of a number of victims, as a result of which the remains of three victims were recovered. There are no proposals for a resumption of searches for the remains of those victims which the commission was unable to locate.</P>
      <P>The plight of those expelled from Northern Ireland by paramilitary groups is a cause of serious concern. The right to choose freely one's place of residence is recognised in the Good Friday Agreement, and the right of those concerned to have the threats against them lifted and to return home is fully endorsed by the Government.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government and officials, in their contacts with parties which have influence on paramilitary groups, regularly urged them to do everything possible to make any information available which would have assisted the commission in locating the remains of the disappeared and continue to press them on the need to resolve the unacceptable situation of those expelled from Northern Ireland.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> In the course of my earlier reply today I said that in response to recent questions on this matter, I clearly indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, the number of stations which have facilities for audio-video recording Garda interviews with detained people, the extent of the system envisaged and the timeframe involved to ensure, at the outset, that a broad national coverage is provided as soon as is practical.</P>
    <P>Completion of the evaluation of the tenders received for the specialised recording equipment, and placing a contract with a supplier is scheduled for early next month.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of the courts, as the Deputy will be aware, is a matter for the Courts Service. Notwithstanding this, the waiting periods in cases of murder and rape before the Central Criminal Court are a matter of concern and I have taken action, within my area of responsibility as Minister, to address the problem. I obtained Government approval for the appointment of an additional High Court Judge who took up duty in February of this year. I also ensured that all the vacancies on the High Court bench which arose in the course of this year were filled. These actions ensured that the court had the maximum statutory number of judges available.</P>
      <P>I have also secured Government approval for the drafting of legislation to further increase by one the number of High Court judges. This will enable the President of the High Court, who is, of course, responsible for the listing and allocation of cases, to address the problem of delays, to the extent that they may be attributable to the shortage of judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While delays in hearing cases can arise for a number of reasons, some of which are outside the control of the court, there is no doubt that the significant increase in the number of cases being returned to the Central Criminal Court is contributing to the delays in the hearing of cases, which are approximately 12 months on average. I am informed by the Courts Service that because of the nature of the cases coming before the Cen<Col N="187" /> tral Criminal Court, it is difficult when listing cases to assess the duration of cases. It is not unusual for trials to take longer than anticipated which means other scheduled cases can not take place and may have to be put back to a later date for hearing.</P>
    <P>In order to deal with the increase in the number of cases coming before the Central Criminal Court, the number of Central Criminal Courts has been increased to four. This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of cases disposed of by the Central Criminal Court. In the legal year ending 31 July 1997, a total of 82 cases were dealt with by the Central Criminal Court. In the legal year ending 31 July 2000, this figure had increased to 133, an increase of 62%. Despite this, the number of cases being dealt with by the Central Criminal Court is not keeping up with the increase in the number of new cases coming before the court.</P>
    <P>Any further increase in the number of judges sitting in the Central Criminal Court is, as I have said, a matter for the president of the High Court.</P>

      <P>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is a very complex instrument and requires long and careful consideration to establish the precise legislative provisions that would be required to enable us to ratify the statute. Even a cursory examination of the statute will give an idea of the complex issues that arise to be dealt with. The end product is likely to be a Bill which will have similarities with the recently enacted International War Crimes Tribunals Act, 1998, but there will be differences because the statute is a more complicated and comprehensive instrument. As the Deputy will be aware, a referendum to amend the Constitution will require to be carried before ratification can be achieved. Assuming that that referendum is successful, the necessary further legislation will be introduced as quickly as possible having regard to other high priority legislative requirements.</P>

      <P>My Department's records indicate that the total number of asylum applicants awaiting a final determination on their asylum applications as at 31 October 2000 is 12,859. I should explain that this figure takes account of all applications made up to that date.</P>
      <P>The current processing time for processing asylum applications from initial application stage to the determination of an appeal &ndash; in cases where applicants avail of the opportunity to appeal &ndash; takes between four months &ndash; manifestly unfounded cases &ndash; and two years. In cases where there is no appeal the processing time is between four to 15 months. Any legal action could extend that period further.</P>
      <P>The aim of my Department is to minimise the time taken from the date of application to completion of the procedure in a refugee determination process which meets the highest EU and international standards and enables applications to be processed within six months. As an illustration of this commitment, I recently received approval for the recruitment of 370 additional staff for, <i>inter alia</i>, the asylum case processing and appeals areas and to deal with consequential repatriations, and these additional resources are already in the process of being recruited.</P>

In addition, a further five persons left the State before the deportation orders could be enforced.</P>
    <P>The following is the position regarding the remaining cases: 189 persons evaded deportation orders; 167 persons were not at their last known address for the purposes of service; and 131 persons have been granted leave to seek judicial review by the courts. Arrangements are being put in place in respect of another 116 persons. Some 94 persons will have to have their returns negotiated with the authorities in their countries of origin.

      <P>In brief, the general position is that a person with a criminal record is considered unsuitable to exercise the powers and duties of a peace commissioner and if a report is received that a serving peace commissioner has been convicted of a serious offence and the details are confirmed, removal proceedings are initiated. It is normal practice to afford the person concerned the opportunity to submit his or her resignation as an alternative to removal from office. Should a resignation not be forthcoming, I <Col N="190" /> am empowered to effect termination of the appointment under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>Should the conviction be overturned on appeal to a higher court, I would review the question of the person's continuation in office, having regard to the fact that a peace commissioner is required to be of good character and standing in the community.</P>
      <P>In so far as this particular case is concerned, I understand that an appeal has been lodged against the convictions to which the Deputy refers. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to take action on the basis of a matter which is still before the courts. I have, however, sought a report from the Garda authorities and should that report provide other grounds to initiate removal proceedings I will, of course, take these into consideration in reviewing the appointment.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious concern expressed by the UNHCR regarding the policy of dispersing newly arrived asylum seekers throughout the country, particularly in view of the difficulties they may face in accessing essential services; the steps being taken to address the concerns raised by the UNHCR; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to a recent newspaper article in which it is reported that the UNHCR is critical of the policy of dispersal of newly arrived asylum seekers throughout the country particularly, because asylum seekers will have difficulty gaining access to important services.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the dispersal of asylum seekers to locations around the country diminishes access to such services. Social welfare, health and educational services in Ireland are organised on a regional and local basis and asylum seekers have the same access to these services as the indigenous population.</P>
      <P>In the case of the provision of health and-or personal social services to an asylum seeker or a member of his or her family, access is arranged, in the first instance, by the local health board. Where specialist treatment is required on an ongoing basis, arrangements can be made by the relevant health board with the Directorate for Asylum Support Services to provide accommodation as close as possible to the particular treatment centre.</P>
      <P>The regional health boards also administer the supplementary welfare allowances scheme. Asylum seekers in direct provision are paid reduced allowances under the scheme to take account of the full board accommodation provided to them. They are also entitled to apply to the local community welfare officer for exceptional needs payments under this scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to legal services for asylum seekers, I am assured that there are no waiting lists for legal services at the Refugee Legal Service. The RLS has adapted its services to take account of the dispersal of asylum seekers to locations outside Dublin and plans to develop its services on a regional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that in another recent newspaper report the senior liaison officer for the UNHCR in Dublin is reported to have been impressed with living standards when she visited a number of <Col N="192" /> accommodation centres for asylum seekers around the country. She is also reported as having been impressed with the attitude of proprietors, support groups and Government officials.</P>

      <P>I have recently received the submission referred to by the Deputy and its contents and proposals are currently being reviewed in my Department.</P>
      <P>It has been the long standing position that non-EEA nationals admitted to the State as students are not entitled to take up employment while pursuing a course of studies here, with the exception of any work experience required as an integral part of their course of studies.</P>
      <P>In general the arrangements relating to the residence of non-EEA students work well and facilitate genuine persons who wish to study here. There is, however, evidence of abuse of those arrangements in some cases by persons whose primary intention is to obtain employment or to migrate permanently rather than to study and return home.</P>
      <P>Consideration of any proposal to permit all non-EEA students to take up employment when they would not otherwise be entitled to do so without a work permit would have to take into account both the level of abuse which already exists and the potential for abuse which would be created in the system. There would clearly be an unwelcome incentive for persons whose real objective is to access the labour market to enrol in a course or to prolong their attendance at a course, simply to be able to remain in employment here. It would be extremely expensive in terms of Garda resources, if not impossible, to police such arrangements with a view to ensuring that only genuine students were working.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy, however, that policy in this area is being kept under review and that the submission from the Union of Students in Ireland will be taken into account in that regard.</P>

      <P>On 28 March 2000, the Government agreed with my recommendations for a statutory agency, under the aegis of my Department, to be called the Reception and Integration Agency. Pending the enactment of legislation the agency will operate on a non-statutory basis.</P>
      <P>This decision follows an earlier decision of the Government that the recommendations in the report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on the Integration of Refugees in Ireland should form the framework for integration policy and be implemented. The establishment of a single organisational structure &ndash; within the overall framework of structures for asylum and immigration &ndash; for co-ordinating and implementing integration policy is one of the key recommendations of the working group. The Reception and Integration Agency will be the vehicle for implementing this recommendation and its establishment will facilitate a cohesive, co-ordinated approach to both the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees. The agency will have responsibility for planning and co-ordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees; co-ordinating and implementing integration policy for all refugees and persons who, though not refugees, are granted leave to remain; and responding to conflict crisis situations which result in relatively large numbers of refugees arriving in Ireland within a short period of time, for example, the Kosovar nationals who were invited here by the Government last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 49 on 5 October Iast, I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government to put the Reception and Integration Agency on a statutory basis as soon as other legislative priorities permit. As the Government has not yet had the opportunity to consider any such proposals, any definitive comment by me at this stage in relation <Col N="194" /> to delegation of authority or budgetary control would be inappropriate. However, I can say that in line with the Government's strategic management initiative and the approach adopted in relation to other agencies in the Justice area, my intention is that the Reception and Integration Agency will have operational independence in its day to day activities, have its own board and its own budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law already contains a number of substantive measures to deal with drinking in public places. Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, it is an offence for any person under 18 years of age to consume alcohol in any place other than a private residence in which that person is present either as of right or by permission.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, makes it an offence for any person to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might be a danger to himself or herself or to any other person in the vicinity. Section 5 of the 1994 Act creates the offence of disorderly conduct in a public place and section 6 creates the offence of using or engaging in any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the 1994 Act also empowers the Garda to confiscate alcohol where it is suspected that an offence under that section is being committed or where it is suspected that an offence under sections 5 or 6 is being committed and the alcohol is relevant to those offences.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the 1994 Act empowers the Garda to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons who are acting in a manner contrary to the provisions of a number of sections including sections 4, 5 or 6 or who are loitering in a public place in circumstances which give rise to apprehension for the safety of persons or property or the maintenance of the public peace.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans for further legislative changes, the operation of the law in this area is being kept under review by my Department. I shall also, of course, take into account any recommendations that may be made on the subject matter by the Commission on Liquor Licensing which I have established, with the approval of the Government, to review all aspects of the liquor licensing system.</P>

      <P>One of the prime objectives of the Prison Service is to develop and put in place an enhanced range of rehabilitative measures which will be made available to all prisoners. The Prison Service already provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes, many of which are available to the general body of prisoners. These have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release. The following are examples of the facilities available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CONNECT 2000-2006 is an action-research project which is run by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in collaboration with <Col N="197" /> the National Training and Development Institute of the Rehab Group. This project focuses on prisoners' transition from custody, through training to reintegration in the community after release and labour market participation.</P>
    <P>The project was run on a pilot basis under funding from the EU INTEGRA employment initiative from 1998-2000. Research was carried out and based on this research, pilot strategies and systems were developed and implemented to fill the gaps discovered in current development programmes for prisoners and to improve the employment prospects of offenders in Mountjoy Prison, the Dóchas Centre and the training unit. The project is being extended to the other prisons in the State during the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The OPTIONS programme, which has been successfully implemented in Mountjoy Prison, Dóchas Centre and the training unit, was designed to provide an opportunity for offenders to explore their career options and to take part in personal development modules. The aims of the programme are: to prepare participants for work-training-education; to enable participants to make informed choices with regard to which developmental activity to take part in prison; to encourage participants to think of the future when making this choice; and to encourage them to take full responsibility for their own development.</P>
    <P>Selection for the programme is based on a four stage process designed to ensure that those who apply are motivated to take part. Entry criteria are that the prisoner is motivated to become involved in work-training-education, is not currently abusing drugs to the extent that they cannot take an active part in programme activities and preferably is unclear as to his-her vocational direction.</P>
    <P>Participants are given the opportunity to give feedback on a regular basis regarding the relevance of course content, their experiences on the programme and new developments they can suggest. This encourages participants to take responsibility for their ownership of the programme and ensures that the facilitator and CONNECT project staff are constantly in touch with what is and is not working in the programme and can make the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>Particular emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of young offenders in custody and, accordingly, a wide range of services is made available as set out hereunder. Efforts are made locally by the governor of each institution to co-ordinate the work of the various services.</P>
    <P>Education Service: This service is provided in conjunction with vocational education committees. A wide range of academic subjects are covered enabling inmates to cover the normal school curriculum and to study for and sit examinations set by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Vocational Training: Training in various vocational skills is available to offenders, <Col N="198" /> including juveniles, with some inmates going on to take City and Guilds examinations. Vocational training is intended not only to provide an occupation for prisoners while they are in custody but to produce skills which are relevant for offenders after they leave prison.</P>
    <P>Library Service: Library facilities are provided in conjunction with the Public Library Service.</P>
    <P>Sports-Physical education: A wide range of sports and recreational facilities is available to inmates.</P>
    <P>Psychology Service and Probation and Welfare Service: The prison Psychology Service and Probation and Welfare Service provides counselling to help offenders to deal with their offending and cope during their time in custody.</P>
    <P>Medical Services: A full range of medical services is available to inmates, including medical drug detoxification programmes.</P>
    <P>Addiction Counselling: Addiction counselling is provided in conjunction with and by various outside agencies such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. In certain cases juvenile offenders with a drugs problem may be granted temporary release conditional upon their attendance at a community based addiction counselling centre.</P>
    <P>Chaplaincy Service: The work of the chaplaincy service involves extensive counselling of offenders, not just in spiritual matters but in everyday human activity.</P>
    <P>The Alternatives to Violence Project is run in a number of prisons. It is an experiential programme to help prisoners learn new skills, alter their attitudes and move towards leading fulfilling and crime-free lives. The project takes the form of weekend workshops. The aims are to build self-esteem and trust, improve communication skills, develop co-operative attitudes that avoid competitive conflict and allow people to try out new and creative ways of resolving conflicts.</P>
    <P>There are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their offending behaviour.</P>
    <P>The first intervention method is individual counselling from the Department's psychology service and from the Probation and Welfare Service. This is a largely demand led service to individual prisoners who ask for help.</P>
    <P>The second intervention is a multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme has been in place in Cork Prison and Arbour Hill Prison since 1998 and has recently been introduced in the Curragh Place of Detention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> The third intervention which tends to receive most media coverage is the extremely intensive offence focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill Prison and which is delivered by officers of the Probation and Welfare and psychology services of the Department. This programme can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete. The emphasis is on accepting personal responsibility for the offence and developing effective relapse prevention strategies for each offender. All convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are held, are invited to apply for inclusion in this programme. A second programme will be introduced in the Curragh Place of Detention by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The fourth intervention which perhaps deserves greater acknowledgement involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category. This is done on a sessional basis, and a call-out basis as well as in response to particular individual crises.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that addiction, particularly to alcohol, is a root cause of domestic violence. Addiction counselling is provided in conjunction with and by various outside agencies such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.</P>
    <P>The prison service has already developed the following programmes to tackle drug addiction among the prison population: all committals to Mountjoy and St Patrick's who misuse drugs are offered a 14 day detoxification programme; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who misuse drugs are offered a 21 day detoxification programme, or less depending on their remand period; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who are involved in a drug maintenance programme in the community prior to committal are allowed to continue their programmes while in custody there; ongoing addiction counselling and education programmes; community based agencies visit prisons to provide support services and information, including individual counselling as required; an information forum is provided by the education-welfare services to prisoners informing them of the risks posed by communicable diseases; and a detoxification and drug free unit is in operation in Mountjoy and an intensive drug free therapy programme co-ordinated by the Probation and Welfare Service and delivered by a multi-disciplinary team is in place.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a second drug treatment programme began at the health care unit in Mountjoy in March 2000. This offers a detoxification and intensive therapeutic counselling over 12 weeks to prisoners nearing release with a view to returning them drug free to a structured drug treatment programme in the community.</P>
    <P>The Action Plan on Drug Misuse and Drug Treatment in the Prison System, which I approved last year, provides a detailed strategy <Col N="200" /> to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan. The plan builds on a medical policy which has been agreed between my Department and the Eastern Health Board in that it seeks to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Director General of the Prisons Service recently established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Health Board, senior prisons service management, Probation and Welfare Service, prisons psychology service and the prison education service. The group submitted their first report to me in July this year and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the Prison Service and health boards. These are due to commence immediately.</P>

      <P>Discrimination on the basis of race, whether in the employment area or in the supply of goods or the delivery of services to <Col N="202" /> which the public generally has access, is outlawed by the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000. Both these Acts are now in operation.  The Office of the Director of Equality Investigations established under this legislation has as its primary function the investigation of complaints of unlawful discrimination and, where discrimination is established, the award of appropriate redress. The Equality Authority provides advice and, where appropriate, assistance to anyone who considers that she or he has been discriminated against contrary to the Employment Equality Act or the Equal Status Act. As well as race, the legislation mentioned also covers discrimination on eight other grounds.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that under section 14(1) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, it is an offence to procure another person to do anything which constitutes discrimination under that Act. Likewise, in relation to the non-employment area, it is an offence, under section 13 of the Equal Status Act, 2000, to procure or attempt to procure another person to engage in discrimination contrary to that Act. I am not aware of any allegations of discrimination of the sort referred to by the Deputy but if he is aware of any alleged attempt to procure discrimination, in breach of either Act, I suggest that he bring the matter to the attention of the Equality Authority, which is empowered to bring prosecutions for alleged offences under the sections mentioned.</P>
      <P>Complaints about advertising may also be brought to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, the industry's self-regulatory organisation. In addition, in relation to radio and television advertising, a statutory code of standards, practice and prohibitions in advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting services is in place. This code has been drawn up by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, under the Broadcasting Act, 1990, and provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that &ldquo;advertising shall not . . . include any discrimination on grounds of race, sex or nationality&rdquo;.</P>

A bacterium, clostridium novyi, was isolated from two of those who died.

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that an investigation was conducted, under the direction of the chief superintendent in charge of the Garda National Drugs Unit, to examine the circumstances surrounding these deaths. The investigation involved liaison with the families and friends of the deceased, health authorities both here and in Scotland, the Strathclyde Police and Dublin City and County Coroners Office. The Garda have identified possible sources of the heroin used in these cases. A number of samples of heroin and biopsy samples taken from the deceased were forwarded to the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, in the United States. The initial results received have proved to be inconclusive. The Garda investigation is ongoing.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to pay tribute to the many men and women who generously give their time to the many sporting and recreational organisations that contribute so much to our society. These organisations play an invaluable role in providing young people with a positive outlet for their energies.</P>
      <P>Although there is no necessary linkage, a lack of recreational facilities can be one of the indicators of multiple deprivation, which, in turn, may be associated with young people who engage in crime. That is why this Government, through a number of Departments, has devoted an unprecedented level of resources to fund a wide variety of activities in the community.</P>
      <P>Only this week, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste announced the National Children's Strategy. One of the objectives of the strategy is that children will have access to play, sport recreational and cultural activities to enrich the experiences of children. I am sure that this initiative will be welcomed by all sides of the House.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the first time this Government has shown its willingness to fund recreational services <Col N="205" /> for children and young people. Over the past three years, the Government has allocated in excess of £35 million under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, operated by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The fund's primary focus has been in Local Drugs Task Force areas where the drugs problem is most acute. In addition, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 commits significant levels of funding to support the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas, including sports and leisure facilities and activities, as well as other recreational activities such as art, drama and music.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Sports Capital Programme operated by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation provides financial assistance to voluntary and community organisations, including sporting organisations, towards the development of sports and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Funding provided to my own Department under the national development plan includes the provision for £16 million for the expansion of the Garda youth diversion projects. This expansion will also assist in enhancing the participants' involvement in recreational activities.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> The figures for 1999 and 2000 are provisional.</P>
    <P>Recent analysis indicates that all community service orders notified to the Probation and Welfare ServiceColour RGB 255,0,0 in 1998 were implemented and that all such orders notified in 1999 have either been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. The number of community service orders notified to 30 June 2000 which have not yet commenced is 212.</P>
    <P>Every effort is made to implement community service orders but there are several reasons an order is not implemented in a particular case or not implemented within a particular timeframe. First, all convicted persons have a right of appeal against conviction and some persons sentenced to community service do so. Implementation of the order cannot proceed pending the outcome of the appeal and even where the order is confirmed on appeal, the effective date of the order will be amended. Second, under section 7(2) of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, a person has 12 months from the date an order is made to perform the work specified in the order and may, under section 9 of the Act, apply for an extension to this period. Thus an order made in 1999 might not fall to be implemented until 2000. Third, a delay in implementation may arise where, for example, an offender is working during the week and arrangements have to be made to enable him or her to perform the community service in the evenings or at weekends.</P>

      <P>The PULSE IT system has been installed in 181 Garda stations-offices throughout the country. These include all Garda stations which are open on a 24 hour-seven day basis, and embrace all district and divisional headquarters. The locations were selected as they capture the bulk of Garda workload on a daily basis, and are linked to the Garda IT centre in Dublin <i>via</i> the PULSE data communications network.</P>
      <P>Due to the scale and complexity of the PULSE project, it was decided that the system would be delivered in two releases, with the first release being further divided into three &ndash; each release building on the other. The first two parts of the first release have been implemented and are operational at the 181 locations mentioned above. I understand that, after some teething problems, the system is now very stable and performing well, and that operational successes directly attributable to PULSE have been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining PULSE functionality will be implemented via the remaining part of the first <Col N="208" /> release and the second release. The final part of the first release is expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2001, and the second release is anticipated during the third quarter of 2001. PULSE is expected to be fully operational at the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>To date, over 11,000 gardaí and civilian personnel have been trained to carry out inquiries on the PULSE system. Initially, a core group of gardaí had been trained to undertake incident capture. This training has now commenced for the remainder of the force.</P>

      <P>The Bill will contain extensive provisions dealing with fitness to plead at a criminal trial. It will contain a definition of criminal insanity and provide for a new verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity to replace the present guilty but insane verdict. It will introduce a new plea of guilty but with diminished responsibility in cases of murder. In addition, it will establish a new review body whose function it will be to review the cases of persons detained after verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity or findings of unfitness to plead.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a Parliamentary Question No. 30 from Deputy Emmet Stagg on 5 October 2000, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, has been the subject of review from time to time. The most recent review, in 1998, was carried out in the context of an EU review of member states compliance with an EU joint action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia. To date, no changes in the law have resulted from these reviews. Nevertheless, I recently announced a further review of the legislation in my Department. While I cannot at this stage predict a timescale, I can say that I hope to conclude the review as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns raised by the motor insurance action group following correspondence received between the group and the Motor <Col N="212" /> Insurance Advisory Board. The concerns relate to the relative high cost of motor insurance for young drivers. A good number of the demands by the group relate to the implementation of the 'Road to Safety' strategy and the introduction of a penalty points system for drivers. These are issues, which are being looked at by my colleague Deputy Molloy, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The group also proposes the establishment of a non-profit making insurance company, specifically for young drivers, with the suggestion that the company be subsidised where necessary by Government. As I have stated previously our Department has no plans to proceed with such a proposal, as it is contrary to EU law.</P>
      <P>The difficulties being experienced by young people in securing motor insurance and, indeed, the high cost of compulsory insurance cover for young drivers is, I understand, directly attributable to the adverse claims experience of such drivers as a risk category.</P>
      <P>A report by Deloitte and Touche which evaluated insurance costs in Ireland found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers was twice that for the 36 to 40 age group. The report also noted that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group were responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, as previously mentioned, which was re-established by me in 1998, is a major initiative aimed at providing information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The board's membership includes a member representing young drivers' interests.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for creating and communicating marine safety information and messages to endeavour to create an improved safety awareness culture and so to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish waters.</P>
      <P>The marine safety working group of my Department is comprised of representatives of the following Government Departments: Marine and Natural Resources, Environment and Local Government, and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The core rescue and safety organisations within the group are the Irish Coast Guard, Marine Surveyors Office (MSO), the Irish Water Safety Association, Health and Safety Authority, Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Irish Sailing Association. Representatives from marine industries and marine recreational organisations are invited to join the group when booklets or pamphlets about their particular occupation or sport are being considered.</P>
      <P>The provision and siting of water safety signs around the coast is primarily a matter for the relevant local authorities. However, my Department is responsible for the provision and erecting of water safety signs in the fishery harbour centres.</P>
      <P>In 1998, my Department was involved with Donegal County Council, Inishowen Rural Development Limited, the National Safety Council, and RNLI in a successful initiative which provided and erected 37 water safety signs at strategic locations around the Inishowen Peninsula. This pilot project was considered to be very successful and my Department would be glad to support any more such initiatives in any other part of the country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the important ongoing agenda of work in my Department. This includes issues such as the enlargement of the EU, the intergovernmental conference on EU treaty changes, disarmament, Northern Ireland, development aid, etc. It is not possible to disrupt this work in mid-year by redeploying the staff members involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach to SECCO membership was two-fold (a) to be able to operate effectively from <Col N="214" /> the start by using a number of people who had the necessary knowledge and experience and who could move seamlessly from campaign work to meet membership demands; and (b) to minimise disruption of the ongoing work of the Department.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for the period of membership to deploy additional staff to carry out work associated with membership. Some of these will work in New York and others in Dublin and Geneva. To meet this need, the Department reassigned a number of officers who had worked on the election campaign. We were also able to call on the services of three experienced people who had taken career breaks and were available to work in New York, Oslo and Geneva. In addition, in order to minimise disruption we have postponed filling two other posts abroad at the normal level until next summer when the next round of planned postings take place.</P>
    <P>The planned postings system was introduced in the mid-1980s. It was designed to allow both the Department and officers and their families adequate time and notice to plan and prepare for reassignments. The practice is that most transfers take place in the summer period. It is, of course, understood that at all times there must be a balance between the needs of the work of the Department and those of individuals affected. There will be the normal planned posting series of transfers next summer and the temporary SECCO staffing operation will not reduce the number of postings that will be on offer.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the decisions taken are the correct and responsible ones from the point of view of good management.</P>

      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the current situation in Zimbabwe. While the severe tension evident prior to the June 2000 elections has eased, the situation remains volatile. There were several outbreaks of violence during the past month and the further deterioration of Zimbabwe's economy continues to exacerbate existing social and political instability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our concern is accentuated by the knowledge that about 2,000 holders of Irish passports live in Zimbabwe. Our Ambassador in Pretoria, who is accredited to Zimbabwe, remains in constant contact with members of the Irish community there. Prior to the June elections, a representative of our Embassy was based in the capital, Harare, to liaise with Irish citizens and to observe the situa<Col N="215" /> tion on the ground. Since then our Embassy has continued to monitor developments closely in consultation with the missions of our European Union partners in Harare.</P>
    <P>With our EU partners, we have consistently called on the Government of Zimbabwe to put an end to the violence and intimidation, and to ensure full respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law. We have urged the Government to establish a constructive dialogue with the opposition and have stressed the importance of guaranteeing all parties their democratic right to operate freely and without harassment. We believe that bipartisan co-operation and respect for democratic principles are essential if the serious economic and social difficulties facing the country are to be overcome. The Government will continue to support all peaceful efforts to resolve the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of land reform, we have called on the authorities to respect the rule of law and to work for a just and equitable solution in accordance with the principles of the 1998 Land Reform Conference as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications and broadband services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecom<Col N="216" /> munications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-99, IR£21 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan 2000-06, to IR£147 million. The allocation of this funding is the responsibility of my Department. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced broadband infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
      <P>A competition has been run by my Department to allocate the first IR£77 million of the funding. The competition process was executed over the summer months, with a closing date of 22 September last. Given the liberalised nature of the telecommunications sector, the competition was run on the basis of public-sector co-funding of network extensions to regional areas where it would not be commercially viable to do so at this point in time. The competition criteria specifically award points for the provision of services in deficit areas and the removal of regional barriers. Such criteria promote the inclusion of rural areas and villages in project proposals by telecommunications operators.</P>
      <P>A large number of project submissions from both the Border, midlands, west and south and east regions have been received. The submissions are currently being assessed and evaluated at arms length by independent consultants under the competition criteria. It is anticipated that contracts on selected projects will be signed before the end of the year and work on further extensions to broadband networks will start early next year.</P>

      <P>It should be emphasised that the existing pension schemes for the Permanent Defence Force are amongst the most generous within the public service. For instance, an enlisted man or non-commissioned officer can retire with an immediate pension and retirement lump sum after some 21 years service, often implying a real potential for retirement from the Permanent Defence Force at about age 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, in the case of commissioned <Col N="217" /> officers, a pension is payable, along with a lump sum after the completion of only 12 years military service. Typically, for example, an officer, such as an army captain or commandant, may retire from the PDF in his or her mid to late thirties and immediately receive a military pension along with a retirement lump sum.</P>
    <P>These generous terms were further enhanced by a voluntary early retirement scheme as part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan over the period 1996-8. The third and final phase of the voluntary early retirement scheme concluded in 1998. There are no plans for a further voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>

      <P>The Chief of Staff is currently preparing a plan to restructure the PDF in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers which requires a reduction of 1,000 personnel. The plan will be based also on the maintenance of existing barracks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current developments are based on the aim of the Amsterdam Treaty's objectives of making the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy more effective, more coherent, and more visible. The capabilities commitment conference to be held in Brussels on 20-21 November represents the culmination of a range of planning work directed at giving effect to the Treaty of Amsterdam and the more recent EU Council decisions at Cologne, Helsinki and Feira in relation to security and defence matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the decisions taken at the Cologne European Council in June 1999, the Helsinki European Council adopted the concept of the EU Headline Goal for the provision of military self-sustaining forces of up to 15 brigades or 50,000-60,000 persons to undertake the full range of Petersberg Tasks. These forces are to be capable of <Col N="218" /> being deployed at 60 days notice for up to one year and available in 2003.</P>
    <P>The elaboration of the Headline Goal will facilitate the achievement by 2003 of an EU capacity to conduct Petersberg Tasks. The development by the EU of this role is consistent with Ireland's tradition of involvement in UN peacekeeping missions. The centrality of the UN and the primary role of the UN Security Council in matters of peace and security is explicitly recognised by the EU. Ireland would only participate in missions authorised by the UN. Participation in an individual &ldquo;Petersberg&rdquo; mission remains a sovereign decision by the Government in every instance and on a case by case basis and any decision to participate would require Dáil approval in accordance with existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence, published earlier this year, sets out key elements of Government policy on overseas peace support operations. It recognises the important role that these operations play as an element of Ireland's foreign and security policy and as a demonstration of support for the United Nations and the conduct of international relations according to the UN Charter. Furthermore, the White Paper sets out a comprehensive development strategy for the Defence Forces to ensure that they are geared to face the challenges and opportunities of the evolving defence and security environment. Most importantly, the White Paper makes provision for a significant new equipment investment programme.</P>
    <P>The capabilities commitment conference is intended to enable EU member states, and other countries, to indicate formally the capabilities which they have available for the Headline Goal. The Government has now approved proposals submitted jointly with my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs in preparation for next week's conference. The Government's decision authorises the commitment of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within the current United Nations standby arrangements system commitment of 8 50. As participation will only arise where UN authorisation is in place the commitment to the EU Headline Goal will not impinge in a negative way on the overall thrust of the overseas peacekeeping effort. As participation in any individual mission will be considered by Government on a case by case basis, this will enable us to determine on each occasion how best to balance commitments to an EU led operation &ndash; under UN authorisation &ndash; with our support for UN led peace support operations within the overall number.</P>
    <P>The planned contribution to the EU Headline Goal in no way degrades our commitment to UN peacekeeping. This contribution reinforces in a very conspicuous way our continued intention to support efforts to maximise international peace and stability. At a time when the UN increasingly looks to regional organisations to undertake peace support operations on its behalf, it is critical to support efforts at EU level to give effect to <Col N="219" /> the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam. What is involved in developing the Headline Goal is no more than giving effect to the treaty.</P>
    <P>As the White Paper on Defence recognised and I know that the Deputies will agree, Irish soldiers have played a significant role in seeking to bring peace to many parts of the world and have deservedly won the respect and admiration of people at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>The importation of bovine animals and products derived from such animals of United Kingdom origin was prohibited under the provisions of the European Communities (Importation of Bovine Animals and Products obtained from Bovine Animals from the United Kingdom) Regulations, 1996 (S.I. No. 87 of 1996). Commission Decision 96/239/EC dated 27 March 1996, as amended by Commission Decision 96/362/EC 11 June 1996, permitted the exportation from the UK of meat products not derived from bovines slaughtered in the UK. In effect this allowed meat products of non UK origin to be processed in the UK under certain conditions and certified for export.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of the European Communities (Importation of Bovine Animals and Products obtained from Bovine Animals from the United Kingdom) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 464 of 1999), S.I. No. 87 of 1996 was revoked. The 1999 regulations permit the importation of deboned fresh beef, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products of UK origin provided that the products are sourced under the EU approved date-based export scheme and approved premises in the UK and from bovines under the export certified herd scheme in Northern Ireland. The regulations maintain the prohibition on the importation of live bovines, bovine embryos, bone-in beef, meat and bone meal and bovine meat products not in compliance with Council Decision 98/256/EC, as amended.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk producers on 30 May 2000.</P>
      <P>For applicants not participating in an official milk recording scheme the number of cows eligible for payment is determined by dividing the milk quota by the notional figure of 876 gallons. As the person named held a milk quota of 25,504 gallons the number of notional dairy cows required to produce this quota was 25,504 divided by 876 equal to 29.11 cows.</P>
      <P>The person named declared 32 cows and three heifers on his 2000 application. When 29.11 is deducted from 32 the number of eligible cows remaining is 2.89.</P>
      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the 2000 suckler cow scheme applicants are eligible to include additional heifers up to 25% of their eligible suckler cows. The person named was therefore eligible for a total suckler cow grant of 3.6 cows (2.89 + .72 i.e. 25% of 2.89).</P>

    <P>The national rural development programme forms part of the regional operational programmes and will be funded under the National Development Plan 2000-06.

      <P>Legal proceedings on behalf of 68 applicants under the farm modernisation scheme were initiated in the Circuit Court in 1989 for grant aid which they claimed they had been denied because of the partial suspension of the scheme in 1983. Following out of court settlements in the High Court of seven other similar cases in November 1996, notice to proceed issued in relation to the 68 cases. After examination of these cases the Department was advised that settlement could be justified in a number of the cases where the farm plans were approved prior to the date of suspension of the scheme. Strictly without prejudice, the solicitors for the farmers' side were so informed by the Chief State Solicitor in November 1997.</P>
      <P>Full details of the proposed settlements, which provide for interest, to the farmers concerned were given to the farmers' solicitors in September 1999. Subsequently there has been some correspondence between the Chief State Solicitor and the farmers' solicitors, the last being a letter from the Chief State Solicitor to the farmers' solicitors on 4 October 2000. The Chief State Solicitor is awaiting a response to this letter, along with confirmation of acceptance of settlements.</P>

      <P>The Government Supplies Agency manages the purchase of personal protective equipment on behalf of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the contract for the supply of 425 leather motorcycle suits was put out to competitive tender. It was advertised in the European Journal, National Newspapers and invitation to tender were also issued to firms on the Government Supplies Agency's bid list of approved suppliers.</P>
      <P>The motorcycle leatherwear comprises one jacket with two detachable liners and one trouser with one detachable liner. The specification requires that the suit offer the wearer protection from impact, abrasion and water ingress. Uniformity in design and makeup are also required. The garment is made be measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six firms responded to the competition, i.e. Carra Ireland Ltd., Kestrel Fashions Ltd., Branded Leather Co., Kawasaki Distributors, <Col N="224" /> A.T. Uniforms Ltd. and Hideout Leathers Ltd. The contract was awarded to the following suppliers:</P>
    <P>A. T. Uniforms Limited, 31 Waterloo Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 and Carra Ireland Ltd., Carra House, Baldoyle Industrial Estate, Dublin 13.</P>
    <P>A. T. Uniforms Limited was awarded the contract for 325 suits @ £625 per suit, on the grounds that the offer conformed to the requirements of the competition and was deemed the most economically advantageous offer received. The following decision criteria were taken into account: price, quality, after sales service, delivery and track record in the supply of certified personal protective equipment. The quality, after sales service and delivery requirements of the competition were set by the garda.</P>
    <P>Carra Ireland Ltd., was awarded a trial contract for 100 suits @ £525 per suit to test an alternative product, which marginally failed to meet the specification but was the lowest priced offer received. This action gave a new competitively priced supplier the opportunity to acquire a proven track record, thus increasing future competition in an area of limited supply. It also tested an alternative commercial standard, with a view to revising the specification for future requirements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the taxpayer received the best value for money.</P>

      <P>In 1982, following a survey in the Civil Service, it was estimated that the average cost of a parliamentary question was about £40. In reply to a parliamentary question in November 1992 the cost was then put at in the region of £65, when account was taken of the general level of inflation over the intervening period. I am advised that applying CPI increases to the above figures would now result in a cost figure of the order of £80. However, the accuracy of any figure so produced would be very questionable, given the long intervening time period, and the changes in work methods and wage levels that have taken place since 1982. Producing a current average cost for <Col N="225" /> answering a parliamentary question would require a detailed Civil Service-wide survey to be undertaken and I have no plans to institute such a survey at this time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department formally notified the European Commission of the business elements of the new town renewal scheme on 19 July 2000 around the same time as the specific towns selected for the scheme were announced by the Minister of State at the Environment and Local Government. The Commission responded on 6 September 2000 with a request for additional information. The matter was discussed in detail at recent meetings with the Commission and a reply is currently being prepared. As things stand at present, it appears that it will take some more months before the business tax incentives elements of the scheme will be approved by the Commission. Such a delay is normal where Commission approval is concerned. As the scheme provides for eligible capital expenditure to be incurred on qualifying works up to the 31 March 2003, I do not believe an extension to this deadline is necessary in the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>In the Budget 2000, I increased the probate tax threshold from £11,250 to £40,000 &ndash; the largest increase of its kind since the tax was introduced in 1993. This increase must be taken in context with the other major capital acquisitions tax changes also made in last year's budget. These included an increase in the three CAT exemption thresholds, the exemption threshold for transfers from a parent to a child is now £300,000, a single CAT rate of 20% to replace the previous higher rates of 30% and 40% and the introduction of a &lsquo;dwelling house' relief which will, in many cases, <Col N="226" /> exempt from inheritance tax the transfer of a family home.</P>
      <P>These significant changes constitutes the biggest single easement in the structure of CAT since its introduction in 1976. Any further changes were ruled against on account of Exchequer costs; however, the issue of further changes in CAT and probate tax will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>Probate tax is levied at a rate of only 2% where the £40,000 threshold is exceeded. However, there is provision in the legislation for deferral of probate tax by the Revenue Commissioners in cases of hardship or where the estate is illiquid. In the case referred to by the Deputy, I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that when the probate tax return has been lodged and processed and the final liability quantified then the method of payment of the tax liability will be considered in the light of the financial circumstances of the individual.</P>

    <P>In the year of bereavement widowed parents continue to be taxed as a married couple. In the years after the year of bereavement widowed parents are entitled to personal allowances which are equivalent to that of a married couple. They are also eligible for an increased standard rate band, £20,150 in the current tax year. In addition to this, in the first five years after the year of bereavement widowed parents are entitled to a widowed parent bereavement allowance, which is tapered over the five years. In the 1999-00 tax year this allowance was available at the marginal rate of tax and amounted to £5,000 in year one and reduced by £1,000 for each subsequent tax year. In the 2000-01 tax year this allowance was increased to £10,000 in year one and reduced by £2,000 for each subsequent tax year. However, the allowance was made available at the standard rate only.</P>

      <P>Additional funding amounting to approximately £5 million has been allocated since 1998 to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and outreach health related support services for children of school going age with autism. These services are provided by multi-disciplinary support teams and include the provision of speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, psychological and social work support services. The multi-disciplinary teams work closely with the parents and families of children with autism to address their needs.</P>
      <P>While there has been a significant level of investment in recent years in these services as outlined above, health boards and specialist voluntary agencies are experiencing difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the health professionals required to deliver these services. My Department is working with health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and the voluntary agencies on a range of initiatives to address these difficulties. The Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, in consultation with my Department, are also putting in place initiatives to increase the number of training places available for these allied health professions. I have also requested health boards and the authority to adopt a flexible approach to the delivery of these services and to examine all possibilities in this area to ensure that as many children as possible have access to the necessary support services.</P>
      <P>The provision of educational services for children with special needs, including those with autism, is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. In recent years there has been a significant expansion of these services and my Department, in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards, has worked closely with the Department of Education and Science to put in place a comprehensive response to the needs of these children and their families. Both Departments will continue to work together to address the needs of these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of health related support services for school going children with autism in the Portmarnock area is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first <Col N="233" /> instance. Since 1998, additional funding amounting to around £1.2 million has been provided to the authority to establish three clinical outreach teams to deliver such services to school going children with autism in the region. The authority has also enhanced the level of respite care available to these children. Discussions have taken place with the authority in the context of the 2001 budgetary process concerning the further enhancement of the services. However I am not yet in a position to comment on any element of the overall health provision for 2001.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the provision of support for the specific children mentioned by the Deputy, I have asked the regional chief executive of the authority to respond directly to you in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government identified in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being intro<Col N="234" /> duced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, increased by one third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>This review is currently taking place and will be supported by an advisory group established by the chief executive officers. I am informed by the chief executive officers that consultative group meetings with the social partners, including the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs, are planned as part of this review process. Particular emphasis will be placed on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>On foot of the national cancer strategy, there has been significant additional investment in palliative care services. Between 1997 and 1999 an additional £6.5 million has been provided by my Department for the development of palliative care services while in 2000 an additional £3.28 million was provided.</P>
      <P>The palliative care services available in the Mid-Western Health Board area includes a consultant-led service for the region based at Milford Care Centre, Limerick, together with palliative care support beds located at the community hospitals and community nursing units. A home-community nursing service is also provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from the board that palliative care support beds in County Clare are to be provided at the community hospital-nursing units at Raheen, Ennistymon and Kilrush. Three palliative care support beds at Cahercalla community <Col N="237" /> hospital constitute the balance of the provision for Clare. These beds have been funded for some time by the board. The funding was increased in the current year from £63,000 per annum to £72,000 per annum, which is in line with the board's average cost for providing a palliative care support bed.</P>
    <P>My predecessor established a national advisory committee on palliative care services and it is due to report by the end of 2000. The committee is considering the development of palliative care services at both national and regional levels having regard to the best interests of patients and their families. I understand it is the board's intention to review palliative care service provision in its area in the light of the findings of the national advisory committee.</P>

      <P>A considerable volume of research has been carried out internationally over the years into possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields surrounding power lines.

      <P>Nevertheless, while it has not been possible to determine a definite link, neither has it been possible to discount any such relationship. For this reason it is, in my view, extremely prudent that we should take all new research reports seriously and continue to carefully examine them. Medical officers in my Department keep informed of any significant developments in this area. I am advised that all new research findings are incorporated into the existing body of scientific literature and are assessed by the broad scientific community.

      <P>Dublin Corporation wrote to my Department in June last seeking funding for the provision and upgrading of central heating in the remainder of their rented houses which lack the facility. The estimated cost of the corporation's proposals was some £16 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the funding of the provision of central heating was outlined in a reply to the corporation in September as follows: the management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation <Col N="240" /> of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources; where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated housing estates, the installation of central heating may form part of the works undertaken; local authorities may seek approval to the use of their internal capital receipts, which are surplus to the requirements of their local authority housing programme and remedial works scheme, for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings; apart from the foregoing my Department has no capital allocation from which to fund the installation of central heating in local authority housing generally.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were advised in February 1994 that full central heating should be provided in all new local authority housing. Information is not available in my Department in regard to the number of local authority houses which do not have central heating.</P>

      <P>The Government strategy also recognised that it is vital that children form good road safety habits from the earliest possible age.

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of free travel scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
      <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. In this regard, CIE have expressed grave reservations about any relaxation in time restrictions, as many of their services are already operating at full capacity, even in off-peak hours. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country. In the circumstances, there is nothing I can do to address the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published in April this year, by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin noted that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that <Col N="245" /> fall within the restricted peak times. The review recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. My Department has written to the Department of Health and Children bringing this recommendation to their attention.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. In applying the legislation, deciding officers do not treat actors any differently to any other unemployment benefit or assistance claimant.</P>
      <P>Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment. However, if there is no employment available within a specialised field within a reasonable period of time, the unemployed person would be expected to broaden his or her search so as to include other types of employment.</P>
      <P>After a period of unemployment, a person would be expected to accept any employment for which he or she is qualified.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of discussions with the union representing actors over recent years in relation to recognising the position of actors within the unemployment payment schemes. A further meeting is due to take place later this month.</P>
      <P>The introduction of special arrangements exempting actors from the requirements to fulfil the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work for entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance would raise equity issues <i>vis-a-vis </i>other claimants to unemployment payments and there are no current plans to make any changes to this legislation.</P>

      <P>Disability allowance regulations provide for a specific income disregard for means test purposes in respect of rehabilitative employment. From 5 April 2000, this disregard was extended to persons who are engaged in rehabilitative self employment. Additionally the amount of income from rehabilitative employment which can be disregarded was increased from £50 to £75 per week.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disability allowance at the rate of £53.50 per week and an increase of £6.60 child dependant allowance per week. His means are derived from farming.</P>
      <P>He applied on 2 November 2000 to avail of the rehabilitative employment disregard in respect of his work as a farmer. He submitted a certificate from his general practitioner that his self-employment was rehabilitative.</P>
      <P>His case was referred to a medical assessor of my Department on 8 November 2000 to establish whether this self employment was rehabilitative in nature. In the light of the views of the medical assessor the deciding officer was of the opinion that the person's self-employment could not be regarded as rehabilitative. The claim for exemption was disallowed accordingly and the person concerned was advised of this decision and of his right of appeal.</P>

      <P>The back to work scheme is designed to encourage lone parents, long-term unemployed persons and those who have a long-term illness or disability to return to the active labour force. This reflects the special difficulties that such persons may encounter when attempting to gain a foothold in the workforce after a long absence.</P>
      <P>The disability benefit scheme is designed to cater for persons who are suffering from short-term illnesses. If a person in receipt of disability benefit is unable to return to work due to a long-term illness they may apply for invalidity pension or disability allowance. The back to work scheme was extended to recipients of disability allowance in April 1997 and to recipients of invalidity pension in June 2000.</P>
      <P>Given that the disability benefit scheme is designed for those whose incapacity is of a short-term, or relatively short-term nature, I do not consider that the extension of the back to work allowance to this group would be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is possible for persons in receipt of disability benefit to be exempted from the rule that they undertake no paid work. Such an <Col N="247" /> exemption would enable the person to undertake part-time work of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature or to participate in a training course to fit them for other work.</P>
    <P>Such an exemption may be granted subject to an evaluation by the Department of the particular circumstances of the case.</P>

    <P>The difference between the estimates and expenditure in 1997 arose because the payment under the rural environment protection scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of amounts additional to standard rates to farmers with land in proposed SACs was not approved by the EU Commission in 1997. Farming conditions to protect such areas could not, therefore, be generally applied in that year. The differences in the years 1998 and 1999 arose in relation to the resolution of issues in connection with the SAC scheme and claims for compensation being less than anticipated.</P>

      <P>The Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act, 1997, provides an additional mechanism for the Garda to deal with drug abuse in public houses and nightclubs. Under section 4 of the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act, 1997, members of An Garda Síochána are empowered to caution and advise licensees-owners of premises where evidence is obtained that the premises are being used to facilitate the sale, supply and-or distribution of controlled drugs.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that no prosecution has been instituted for the period 1998 to date under the Act. However, cautions and warning notices, accompanied by advice from members of An Garda Síochána, have been used successfully in dealing with and alleviating the supply of drugs on licensed premises. On numerous occasions, the issue of a warning notice has had the effect of either causing a change of the licensee or the closure of the licensed premises. The Garda authorities have assured me that the situation is being monitored on an ongoing basis and that pro-active operations such as Operation Nightcap continue to gather evidence for prosecution.</P>
      <P>Operation Nightcap which was set up in December 1997 is co-ordinated by the Garda National Drugs Unit and is designed to target the sale and distribution of controlled drugs in nightclubs and licensed premises. Since the start of Operation Nightcap, the number of persons charged and convicted is 113; the number of premises closed is seven and 50 warning notices were served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following number of warning notices was <Col N="250" /> issued under section 4 of the Licencing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act, 1997:</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the ongoing terrible injuries and fatalities on Irish roads and streets, he will give consideration to requesting the Government to establish a separate traffic police corps or highway patrol for motorways and national roads where large numbers of motorists seem to continuously break the speed limits.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21240/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety 1998-02, which aims to reduce Irish road fatalities by a minimum of 20% on their 1997 level, is working. Provisional data for 1999 shows a continued downward trend towards the primary target of the strategy.</P>
      <P>Despite the encouraging continued downward trend the Government accepts that our road fatality and serious injury rate is still unacceptably high and is determined that all the provisions of the national strategy are implemented in full. The strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety which is chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Two progress reports have been published by the high level group and I understand that copies were circulated to all Deputies and are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the provisional figure for the number of road fatalities for the year 2000 as of 14 November 2000 is 355. The figure for the corresponding period in 1999 was 370. This continued downward trend has to be viewed in the context of the significant increases in the number of vehicles on our roads since 1997.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Garda co-operate with the relevant agencies in trying to reduce the number of accidents on our roads and increased enforcement of road traffic legislation is one of the key elements of the strategy. The enforcement of road traffic legislation is given a high priority by the Garda and I am assured by the Garda authorities that this policy will continue.</P>
      <P>With regard to Garda enforcement, in relation to speeding, in 1999, a total of 178,009 fines on the spot were issued and, in addition, there were 30,105 prosecutions for speeding offences. In the year 2000 up to 6 November a total of 188,005 fines on the spot for speeding were issued by the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> As regards the Deputy's proposal to establish a dedicated traffic police corps, the Government has no such plans. There is a traffic corps in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement. In addition, all uniformed gardaí throughout the State are involved in traffic law enforcement as required. Although the primary responsibility of the traffic corps is accident prevention and traffic control, members of the corps deal with all matters that require Garda attention.</P>

      <Quest>the precise steps Ireland will be taking to honour its commitment in the Strasbourg Declaration towards the elimination of racism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22342/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The declaration adopted at the European Conference on Racism in Strasbourg identified three areas for action to prevent and eliminate racism, i.e., legal measures, policy measures and education and training measures. Many of the steps outlined in the declaration have already been taken by Ireland. For example, we now have a comprehensive anti-discrimination <Col N="253" /> legal code in place and an equality infrastructure which offers redress for individuals to pursue complaints in regard to discrimination experienced on nine grounds, including religion, race and membership of the Traveller community. These have been provided under the Employment Equality Act and Equal Status Act.</P>
      <P>Social inclusion strategies, including those under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in the area of social inclusion-anti-poverty-education have encompassed marginalised social groups including Travellers and other minorities. Action will be taken, where appropriate, to specifically incorporate an anti-racism dimension into these strategies.</P>
      <P>As regards international instruments, arrangements are being made to secure ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) by the end of this year. The EU race directive was adopted in June of this year and steps will be taken to make any necessary amendments to domestic legislation to bring it into force here.</P>
      <P>More details of the precise steps already taken and those under way under the three headings are as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Legal Measures</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Racial discrimination in employment, training, accommodation, education and the supply of goods and services, including public services, is outlawed by the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Commission Act, 2000 was enacted earlier this year. The Commission, which is being established under the Act, will be a powerful new independent body charged with the task of keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of our laws in relation to the protection of human rights in their widest sense.</P>
      <P>The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, makes it an offence to incite hatred against any group of persons on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, or membership of the Traveller community. The Act is under review at present to see if it can be made more effective.</P>
      <P>The Offences Against the State, Act, 1939 enables the State to declare illegal and prohibit organisations which promote and incite racial discrimination. That Act also renders membership of such organisations a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>EU Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, also known as the &ldquo;Race Directive&rdquo;, will be transposed into Irish law by 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has already signed the major universal and European human rights instruments and complies fully with their terms. Ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) is expected to be completed by the end of this year. On 4 November in Rome, <Col N="254" /> Ireland signed Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol No. 12 is a measure intended to take further steps to promote the equality of all persons through the collective enforcement of a general prohibition of discrimination. Work on the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into national law is continuing.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities was ratified by Ireland on 1 May 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Policy Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>An equality infrastructure has been put in place to underpin our anti-discrimination legislation, i.e., the Equality Authority and the Office of Director of Equality Investigations. They provide free advice and redress to those who have suffered racial discrimination.</P>
    <P>A committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community was established in June, 1998. The committee chaired by my Department, is representative of Traveller interests, the four social partners and relevant Departments. The committee is currently preparing its first progress report for submission to Government later this month.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism (NCCRI) was established. The NCCRI has been instrumental in drawing together key Government bodies and NGO groups to address racism.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the NCCRI, as part of its overall aim of developing an integrated approach against racism, introduced an Anti-Racism Protocol for political parties and a Declaration of Intent for candidates for elections.</P>
    <P>The Garda, under the auspices of the Garda Community Relations Section, have recently established a Garda Intercultural Unit. In addition, a working group has been reviewing all aspects of Garda training in the area of human rights in order to develop best practice in the light of ongoing changes in the policing environment.</P>
    <P>The Director General of our Prisons Service recently sought proposals for the development of a research and training project for staff and inmates of the prison system to increase their awareness of cultural diversity and aspects of racism that are potentially in each prison.</P>
    <P>Last March, the Government decided to establish a reception and integration agency. Its functions will include planning and co-ordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees. It will also co-ordinate and implement integration policy for all refugees, including programme refugees, and persons granted leave to remain in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government has commitments to wider social inclusion policies, e.g., local development programme; community development programme and the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS. The NAPS was launched in April, 1997 <Col N="255" /> and has set a ten-year target for poverty reduction in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Educational and Training Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>In October, the Government agreed to proposals for a framework for a comprehensive public awareness campaign, with a core budget of £1.5 million per annum over a three-year period, to address racism and promote a more inclusive, intercultural society.</P>
    <P>An anti-racism in the workplace week, organised jointly by IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation, ICTU and the Equality Authority took place from 6 to 10 November 2000.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the Government allocated a sum of £900,000 to fund a Traveller Communications Programme over a three year period, 1999 to 2001. The objective of the programme, entitled &ldquo;Citizen Traveller&rdquo; is to address the underlying causes of mistrust between Travellers and the settled community and to promote a greater understanding between both communities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides funds towards a mediation service for the Traveller community operated by Pavee Point Traveller Centre. One of the main objectives of the mediation service is to encourage the development of new and constructive approaches to the resolution of disputes and conflicts, particularly where they affect the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>Issues of tolerance and anti-racism are addressed in the new primary school curriculum through the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme. Civic, social and political education is a core subject in the junior cycle for recognised post-primary schools. The CSPE programme prepares students for active participatory citizenship and to understand and respect human rights. The White Paper on Adult Education, published in July, acknowledges the challenge of providing an intercultural education.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;Schools Against Racism&rdquo; week is being organised in March 2001.</P>
    <P>The NCCRI has undertaken anti-racism training for statutory agencies and public bodies.</P>

      <P>The Children Bill, 1999, which is at present awaiting Committee Stage before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, <Col N="256" /> Defence and Women's Rights, provides a statutory basis for the imposition of curfews on young offenders. Section 133 of the Bill gives the courts power to order that a child whom it has found guilty of an offence be at a particular residence at any times between 7.00 pm and 6.00 am the following morning or that a child stay away from any specified premises, place or locality during specified days or between specified times. The Garda can call at the residence at which the child must be for the purpose of establishing that the child is present there at the relevant time.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for the possibility of curfews as a condition of the grant of temporary leave from children detention schools. In addition, curfews could form part of the action plan which may be formulated under the restorative conferencing provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to tackling the drug problem in the prison system. The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved last year provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders and reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system.</P>
      <P>Efforts to reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system are being pursued vigorously. In this regard, a number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing. This policy has been further strengthened in Cloverhill remand prison and the new Midlands Prison by the extensive use of screened visits. On occasions where visitors are found attempting to supply drugs to inmates, gardaí are called to the prison with a view to prosecuting the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these measures are successful. For example, in the period April 1998 to April 2000, there were 622 seizures of drugs in Irish prisons and a number of people were successfully prosecuted for attempting to supply drugs to inmates.</P>

      <P>Since deportations commenced under the Immigration Act, 1999, I have made a total of 867 deportation orders. One hundred and thirty-one persons have been deported, representing 15% of deportation orders made. In addition, a further five persons left the State before the deportation orders could be enforced.</P>
      <P>The following is the position in the relation to the remaining cases: 189 persons evaded deportation orders; 167 persons were not at their last known address for the purposes of service; 131 persons have been granted leave to seek judicial review by the courts. Arrangements are being put in place in respect of another 116 persons. Some 94 persons will have to have their returns negotiated with the authorities in their countries of origin. Deportation orders in respect of the remaining 34 persons are being, or have been, revoked, primarily on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The travel and escort arrangements put in place in respect of any deportation order depend on the number of persons to be deported to a particular destination, the availability of flights and the requirements of airlines and immigration authorities in other jurisdictions in relation to escorts.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that while separate details for the North side of Dublin are not readily available, a review of all fatal and serious injury traffic accidents in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, DMR, for the period 1997 to 1999, was carried out recently by the Garda and yielded the following findings:  Fatal traffic accidents decreased by 34% and serious injury traffic accidents decreased by 52%. There was a high level of pedestrian involvement, mainly in elderly and younger age groups. In almost half of the accidents involving pedestrians, the pedestrian was found to be within 100 meters of a controlled crossing, of which they did not avail. In respect of drivers, carelessness and speed were the main factors.</P>
      <P>The findings were broadly similar throughout the region and that a combination of remedial measures were identified. I understand that an inter-agency forum has been established involving the Garda Síochána and local authorities to regularly review fatal and serious injury accidents with a view to co-ordinating the appropriate remedial action necessary to further reduce fatal and serious injury accidents in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>The present legal position in relation to trespass on land is that it is a civil wrong and, for the most part, falls to be addressed by means of civil remedy. In broad terms, that civil wrong may be defined as consisting of intentionally or negligently entering or remaining on, or directly causing anything to come into contact with, land in the possession of another without lawful justification.</P>
      <P>Trespass may also be dealt with under the criminal law in certain circumstances and the criminal law provisions dealing with this matter include a range of offences under the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals to change the law in this area, my Department will continue to keep it under review.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under section 30 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the Legal Aid Board has sole responsibility for the provision of legal services, including the location of law centres. The Deputy will appreciate that, under the legislation, I am precluded from directing the board in matters of this nature.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Legal Aid Board currently operates a part-time law centre in Carlow. The centre is operated by the staff of the law centre in Kilkenny, which includes two solicitors.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that the waiting time for an appointment with a solicitor in Carlow in October 2000 was seven months, the same as in Kilkenny. I am further informed by the Legal Aid Board that the number of applicants on the waiting lists at the end of October in Carlow and Kilkenny were 81 and 76 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that, in relation to those applicants waiting for legal services, the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and cases where there are <Col N="263" /> time limits. In these cases the application is dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for some years and this was extended on a nation-wide basis earlier this year. This scheme provides legal services in certain family law matters in the District Court namely, domestic violence, maintenance and custody/access. This scheme, while increasing the services provided by the board, should also enable the law centres to devote more resources to non-District Court matters and should help to reduce waiting times in law centres, including the Carlow part-time centre.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Legal Aid Board that there are no plans at present to open a full-time law centre in Carlow. However, I can assure the Deputy that this matter is being kept under continual review.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board is currently reviewing the allocation of its staff resources to deal with the respective needs of the law centres and that the question of assigning an additional solicitor to Kilkenny is under consideration.</P>

      <P>The person referred to arrived in the State in December, 1997. His claim was determined initially following an interview on 13 January 1999 and his application for refugee status was turned down. He appealed this decision on 30 July 1999 through his legal representatives. The Independent Appeals Authority recommended that the appeal be refused and the person referred to was informed of this decision in writing on 31 May 2000. At that time, the person referred to was informed that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and he was given the opportunity to either leave the State voluntarily, consent to a deportation order or make representations as to why he should not be deported.</P>
      <P>Representations were received subsequently from his legal representatives and several other individuals. I took these representations into account when considering the matter under section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 and having fully considered the matter, I decided to make a deportation order in this case. The person referred to was notified of this decision on 12 September 2000 under the provisions of section (3)(<i></i>b)(ii) of section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 and was requested to present himself at a particular location on 18 September 2000 for the purpose of assisting with his deportation.</P>

      <Col N="264" /> He failed to turn up for this appointment and, consequently, in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended by the Illegal Trafficking Act, 2000, he is liable for arrest and detention without warrant for the purpose of ensuring his deportation from the State. I do not consider that a review of my decision in this case is warranted.</P>

      <P>Other examples of high level techniques are the detection of firearm residue particles using automated scanning electron microscopy. The laboratory also uses computer equipment to read tachograph charts from commercial vehicles in cases involving accident investigation, carriage of stolen goods etc.</P>
      <P>In addition the laboratory carries out DNA profiling of body fluid from injured parties and from crime scenes. Other examples of the use of modern techniques is in the area of footprints and fingerprints which are now stored and compared in the laboratory through the use of computer equipment.</P>

      <P>The Director General has also briefly discussed the issue with headquarters &ndash; based officials in the Department of Education and Science. Contact has also been made with authorities in other jurisdictions and there have been site visits by prison officials to juvenile offender facilities in the USA and the UK in recent months. Officials from the architectural services division of the Office of Public Works visited the new secure juvenile unit in Scotland during the summer.</P>
      <P>Discussions regarding the procurement of new facilities which will be required by my Department for juvenile offenders aged between 16 and 17 years are taking place on an ongoing basis with the Office of Public Works.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The school in question has two special classes for pupils with autism which were sanctioned by my Department in June of this year. Each class caters for a maximum of six pupils and has the support of a class teacher and a special needs assistant. The school authorities also receive enhanced capitation funding in respect of chil<Col N="270" /> dren enrolled in the special classes and funding is provided to meet special equipment needs.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a range of measures to improve the level of service provided to children with autism. These measures included: a doubling of the level of special needs assistant support provided to each special class catering for children with autism, and the extension of the school year through the month of July in the case of all special facilities catering for children with autism.</P>
    <P>As a result of these developments, arrangements are currently being made in my Department to provide two additional special needs assistant posts to the school in question.</P>
    <P>In addition to receiving the necessary educational supports, children with autism can require a range of therapeutic support services. Such services are provided by the relevant health authority. In the case in question, an outreach support service is provided to the special classes in question by the relevant health authority.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department's inspectorate to make contact with the school in question to investigate the adequacy of the current range of supports provided to the children in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 270, 271 and 272 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I launched the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland on Friday, 10 November last. The incoming authority will establish and maintain a framework of qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners in all institutes, colleges and places of further and higher education and training. It will also facilitate lifelong learning and promote access, transfer and progression for all learners including those who have special needs. An important feature of the work of the new authority will be to ensure the recognition of Irish qualifications internationally and of outside qualifications here.</P>
      <P>The membership of the designate authority mirrors that provided for under section 6 of the Act.</P>
      <P>The designate authority will immediately enter into consultations with the relevant stakeholders in the process to clear the way for me to bring the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act fully into operation in the new year.</P>
      <P>It is also my intention to establish the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, on a statutory basis in the new year pending the outcome of the National Qualifications Authority's consultations with the relevant stakeholders.</P>
      <P>The membership of both councils is provided for in the Act and I have commenced the nominations process with the appointment of the designate chairperson of HETAC in his capacity as a member of the designate National Qualifications Authority. The designate chairperson of FETAC when appointed, will also be a member of the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>if he will provide details of the projected figures for secondary school provision in the Ballymun area, Dublin 11 for the next ten and 20 years; the level of provision which is proposed under the comprehensive schools amalgamation plans; the target retention rates to leaving certificate which he intends to achieve for this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>There is a current enrolment of under 800 pupils attending the three comprehensive schools in Ballymun. Amalgamation of the three schools has been agreed in principle and it is intended that the amalgamated school will be located in the junior school complex, which will be refurbished for that purpose. The junior school complex was originally built to cater for 1,600 pupils. It is envisaged that enrolment in the amalgamated school could grow to approximately 1,000 pupils.</P>
      <P>Improving school attendance and preventing early school leaving are not simple matters to resolve. I do not want to understate the scale and complexity of the problem by setting absolute timescales for reaching particular levels of retention. There are strategies in place to encourage and support schools retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard, Ballymun senior and junior comprehensive schools are among the schools receiving funding under the stay in school retention initiative at second level.</P>
      <P>Overall, I am satisfied that sufficient provision has been made to cater for all post-primary needs in the Ballymun area for the foreseeable future. As part of the assessment of post-primary school accommodation needs in the area, officials from my Department met with representatives of Ballymun Regeneration Limited who were of the view that their development proposals would not have significant implications for existing school provision in the area.</P>

      <P>My Department has provided a psychological service to post-primary schools in County Waterford for many years. Twenty five additional educational psychologists have recently taken up their positions in the National Educational Psychological Service. These newly appointed psychologists are currently receiving their induction training and will be assigned to schools in the near future. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that two psychologists will be joining the south-eastern team during the current school year in order to initiate a psychological service to primary schools in County Waterford.</P>
      <P>The health boards are represented on the management committee of NEPS and may obtain information from that source. However, a joint NEPS-health board liaison committee has recently been established and I will draw its attention to the need to make information about NEPS available to all health boards.</P>
