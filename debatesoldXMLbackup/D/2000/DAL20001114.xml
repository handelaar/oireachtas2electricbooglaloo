    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department is not negotiating or preparing any international multilateral agreements. There are no such agreements under the auspices of my Department which have not been signed by the State, nor are there any agreements falling within my Department's ambit which have been signed but not ratified or acceded to by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Would it be normal that his Department be consulted about other Departments engaged in discussions and negotiations in respect of international agreements of the United Nations, the European Union or the Council of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe so, certainly not at my level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems from replies to similar questions to other Departments, the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there are some 40 items outstanding which would require in the order of 19 Bills. Is anybody monitoring the extent of our legislative exposure? In fairness, this goes back over a number of Administrations, it is not a problem which has arisen in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn, we are moving away from the substance of these questions, which refer specifically to the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise it with the Department and if there is any progress, I will let the Deputy know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could it be said that the proposed Treaty of Nice is a multilateral agreement, in which the Taoiseach will be intimately involved in negotiating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be involved in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there not a reference to that in his reply? Is he satisfied with the method of operation of the European Council in finalising this treaty, given that it is done without officials by Ministers on their own, having to communicate, over long distances <i>via </i>one official to other officials who are even further away, for advice to be obtained by the Taoiseach, who is often there on his own or perhaps with one other person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton, again we are wandering away from the substance of the questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1347" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Taoiseach has accepted that this is an agreement in which his Department is involved. Therefore, the question is relevant. Would the Taoiseach deal with those matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that was not mentioned is it was not the question asked. The Nice Treaty will not come under the aegis of my Department. When it is to be ratified, it will come under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and it is strictly in line with the questions Deputy Quinn asked.</P>
      <P>On the question, those are the arrangements which the French Presidency put in place for the Biarritz Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not matter so much at Biarritz as that was an informal Council. When one comes to agreeing the words of a treaty, agreeing law for the Union or agreeing a constitution for the Union, in effect, which is what will be done in Nice, it is unsatisfactory to be in such a position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton, we are moving away altogether from the substance of the questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is directly in order. Are we trying to make this House irrelevant by interruption like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions refer specifically to agreements under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for Biarritz will not apply. There were many complaints about the Biarritz Council. Even though it was an informal council, there was effectively little or no contact with anybody outside. For Nice, they will probably go back to something near the normal arrangements, but President Chirac's views on this may be different to the views of other Chairmen in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Would the Taoiseach agree that he has overall responsibility for the policy of the State regarding the EU and therefore the questions should have drawn from him a substantial answer regarding the upcoming treaty to be finalised at Nice? In that regard, would the Taoiseach agree that essentially an 80,000 strong EU army will be set up? Would he agree that he has conceded neutrality, for which he has said the State and his party stands, and has thrown it away? Will he now admit that to the people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I still press my point of order. Does the Leas-Cheann Comhairle agree the Taoiseach will act as Head of Government at Nice in agreeing this treaty? He is not acting under anybody's aegis but his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a position but the questions specifically refer to what is under his aegis. What we want to avoid is the Taoiseach, on Taoiseach's Question Time, answering questions that are more appropriate to other Ministers in Cabinet. That has been a long standing precedent in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking the Taoiseach questions only about matters in which he is personally and directly involved. He will be personally involved in Nice. I am asking him only about matters that affect his direct personal responsibility. If I cannot ask about those matters, I do not know what I can ask about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When is that legislation likely to come forward?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will certainly be next year. It is only in the early stage of preparation and it will be brought forward by the two Departments <Col N="1349" /> I have already mentioned which will take over these matters at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a very busy legislative load. The Taoiseach will be aware that the Opposition parties were briefed by the directors of Campus and Stadium Ireland recently and that the whole project depends on an agreement being reached with prospective tenants of the national stadium &ndash; that component of the overall campus. Is the Taoiseach saying legislation will be needed for Campus Ireland, irrespective of whether the stadium project goes ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's Department that is drafting this legislation even though the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will have responsibility for it? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has just said the project will go ahead irrespective. At the briefing to which Deputy Quinn referred, my understanding was &ndash; perhaps I was wrong &ndash; that the project would go ahead only if there was a significant anchor tenant. Is it not the case that today's newspapers report that the rugby authorities have opened discussions with Croke Park about playing there? In those circumstances, who does the Taoiseach believe will be the anchor tenant in the stadium if the project goes ahead?</P>

        <b>:</b> If the Taoiseach and the Government have their way, which may not happen, up to £700 million will be spent on the new stadium. In view of that, would it not be more proper if the legislation envisaged to set up and install Campus and Stadium Ireland was first brought before the Dáil for a full discussion since such a huge amount of taxpayers' money is involved? In regard to what Deputy Rabbitte asked, how near is the Taoiseach to signing up some serious anchor tenants who might begin to make this project look somewhat viable rather <Col N="1350" /> than a project which the Taoiseach would like to see built&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not answer part of Deputy Rabbitte's question. What I meant was that I believe the anchor tenants and all the main sporting bodies will be there at the end of the day. It will be expensive to undertake the work which is progressing. The project was debated in the Dáil on its commencement. It was debated also on many occasions during questions to me and to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, can I take it that irrespective of whether the stadium project goes ahead &ndash; there are questions around that issue and we will know whether it is a viable project by the end of this year or early next year &ndash; the remainder of the project, including the swimming pool, sports facilities, headquarters of the various sporting organisations and medical facilities related to that, will go ahead, and that in due course will require legislation which will be promoted, not by the Taoiseach's Department, but by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation? Is that a correct understanding of the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary work has just commenced in my Department. As I outlined in this House on five or six occasions, at the outset I co-ordinated the work on both projects.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Arsenal Football Club has decided to build a 60,000 seater stadium for £100 million sterling? Will he clarify for the House whether the stadium <Col N="1351" /> will proceed irrespective of whether the IRFU or the FAI is the anchor tenant? To secure the acquiescence of Croke Park in playing a major game at the stadium in the event of it proceeding, is it likely the State will be approached for a further substantial injection to Croke Park as part of securing such acquiescence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The stadium would not be built if there were no anchor tenants. At least two organisations have stated their position in relation to the stadium and, I hope, the third one will do so in due course because it would make sense. However, that is a matter for the organisation itself. If there were no anchor tenants, there would be no point building the stadium. I have not been involved in discussions with Croke Park other than in relation to its support for the national stadium. Croke Park is completing its own stadium. I am sure if there are requests for funding for grounds other than Croke Park, these will be made to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure has met on 12 occasions to date. Its last meeting was on 7 November 2000. The committee meets as required, usually on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure is an integral part of Government and its meetings, as with any Cabinet committee, are an integral part of the business of Government. The practice has grown up over time of allowing questions in the House as to the date and number of meetings of such committees. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet committee meetings have not been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      <P>A great deal of work is being done on all aspects of the infrastructure agenda. Questions on particular aspects should be put down to the relevant Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am allowed to ask, will the Taoiseach confirm a decision of that committee was that, on reflection, there was no desirability in establishing a special division of the High Court to process as speedily as possible planning applications and other matters which were being delayed because of the long queues for access to the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. It was considered that may not be the best and most desirable way of moving forward because a number of courts and judges are involved in several of these cases. Matters have evolved in comparison to the position a few years ago where one court and one judge would have been the best way forward. However, there are now so many of these cases that it would have the opposite effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the announcement made on 17 November 1999 has, in effect, been abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis that it would not be efficient and would give the wrong result. For example, three different cases were going ahead simultaneously recently. It would not speed up the process, which was the intention; it would have the opposite effect. This is the view of those who deal with the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If a paper in relation to that set of recommendations or conclusion was available, it <Col N="1355" /> would be most useful for future Administrations. Regarding the infrastructural blockage and delay, has the committee made any decision on recruiting more planners at national and local levels to deal with the massive backlog of planning applications?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving away from the substance of the question. The Deputy is aware in relation to Cabinet sub-committees that there is a long-standing precedent that supplementary questions may not be raised on any items discussed at meetings of the committee or any recommendations made by the committee to Government as the raising of such issues would impinge on matters internal to Cabinet. This is a long-standing precedent in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this Cabinet sub-committee was announced by him as if it was something of significance? If it is something of significance, does he agree that it should be something about which he is prepared to answer questions in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I chair six different Cabinet sub-committees. The practice is that sometimes these questions are ruled out of order while at other times they are considered to be in order. The precedent when Deputy Bruton was Taoiseach was that one only received dates in response to questions. One was told when a meeting was held; he did not say anything about the questions in so far as they related to Cabinet sub-committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably why the infrastructure was as it was when I took over. Five or six Ministers attend these meetings. There is no point in having Departments if I deal with them all, although I am well capable of doing that as I have demonstrated on many occasions. However, the rule is that I answer questions in relation to what I deal with and that is not chairing the meetings. If the rules are changed, I will stick by them. That is the position.</P>

It has driven the plans of the National Roads Authority regarding roads such as the southern cross motorway, the south eastern motorway, which is out to tender, the port tunnel and the Limerick by-pass.</P>
      <P>Regarding the matter to which Deputy Quinn referred, the committee is considering the issue of planners. An examination of the difficulties in the construction area has been carried out. There was an insufficient number of planners and the number of places for students at third level has been doubled or trebled this year to address the shortfall in this area. The committee is also considering ways of enhancing packages to attract planners from outside the country.</P>
      <P>The committee is also involved in the quality bus corridors, the Luas line, the metro system and relevant matters. However, the detail of all those matters rests with other Ministers.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Taoiseach inform the Dáil if the remit and the guidelines of the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure will reflect the implications of the recent catastrophic <Col N="1357" /> flooding for infrastructural development in the State? Does he agree that climate change and the fact it is being drastically affected by human activity puts an onus on the State and on the Cabinet sub-committee to come up with radical new thinking and action to meet the new challenges posed by this development? Has the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure decided on and agreed a detailed national spatial plan which will be implemented through the national development plan? Given that the national development plan is supposed to be in place by 2006, does the Taoiseach agree it is essential that the details of the Government's proposals for infrastructural development should be outlined and debated? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The two sets of questions are relevant to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The answer to the Deputy's first question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. All those matters have been discussed at the infrastructure committee and at a meeting in recent days. I am sure the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will be glad to give the details to the Deputy. The report on the national spatial plan will be completed next year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pursue the Taoiseach on his interpretation of the doctrine of Cabinet confidentiality as it applies to these committees. Is the Taoiseach aware that he informed the House a few moments ago that representatives of IBEC and ICTU, who are not part of the Government structure, attend some of these Cabinet sub-committee meetings? Does he see it as strange that organisations, which for all their great qualities are not elected by anyone, are attending these meetings while we in this House, who are elected, are not able to ask questions about what happens at these meetings? Does he agree his answer about the Cabinet sub-committee is an eloquent commentary on the extent to which parliamentary democracy has been replaced by other forms of consultation on matters of importance? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of what happens at this or at any other committee can be obtained by tabling questions to the relevant Ministers with responsibility for these issues. The CIF, IBEC and ICTU have attended meetings on issues relevant to them. Ministers and senior officials have also attended where necessary. On any of the issues under consideration, including QBCs, accelerating work projects, the involvement of project teams on the eastern by-pass and the various other road systems, the railways, trains, metro lines and the Luas light rail project, Deputies can obtain information by submitting questions to the relevant Ministers. I am not the relevant Minister.</P>

Does he not regard it as very unsatisfactory from the perspective of parliamentary democracy that bodies like ICTU, IBEC and the CIF participate in Cabinet discussions on which Members of this House cannot ask questions? Does he agree this proves, more than anything, that, as Deputy Jim Mitchell has said, we need a democratic revolution to restore parliamentary democracy to the proper position of primacy in the structures of Government it has been denied?</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton and others present me with a difficulty because they want me to answer questions on behalf of other Ministers. That is not the procedure in this House. If they wish to submit questions to the relevant Ministers they will get all of the information they require.</P>

      <P>It is not. Questions may not be asked about such deliberations, but that is a different aspect. Where a group attends a Cabinet sub-committee meeting and makes a submission on, say, the national development plan, it is necessary to answer questions about such meetings. Such aspects are not bound by confidentiality. The Ceann Comhairle allows parliamentary questions on them.</P>
      <P>What is at issue is who answers questions on meetings involving six or seven Ministers that I chair. It is not me, but the individual Ministers with responsibility for their areas.</P>

      <P>I would like the Taoiseach to clarify one of his earlier replies lest the House is inadvertently misled. The Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure co-ordinates spending in the region of £20,000 million or at the very least co-ordinates a spend which represents at least one third of the total spend of £48,000 million. Am I to understand from the Taoiseach's earlier reply that the work of the sub-committee, which co-ordinates the activities of various Departments, which, of necessity, must be progressed together, is not the full-time responsibility of any one person? In other words, am I correct in thinking this is a part-time job undertaken by a civil servant in the <Col N="1361" /> Taoiseach's Department who also has other responsibilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I will answer the question again. I chair the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure and a small number of my senior officials co-ordinate its work. The senior and line officials of the relevant Ministers work to that committee on various issues. For example, Department of the Environment and Local Government officials from the sections with responsibility for roads or sewerage and drainage are responsible for issues relating to their sections as are officials with responsibility for CIE etc. A separate unit with responsibility for public-private partnership, which is a key element of the national development plan, is located in the Department of Finance and is staffed by full-time officials. A co-ordinating group for the national development plan is also staffed by full-time officials and the presentation of the national development plan is handled by a separate unit in the Department of Finance which, again, is staffed by full-time officials.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach request the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure to address one of the most glaring and serious omissions from the national development plan, namely, that the road to the north and north-west has been ignored completely? There will be spurs to Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, with roads raised to the standard of dual carriageway or motorway, while the road to Donegal and Derry will have minor improvement works. Access is the key to development in the north-west, particularly in County Donegal where there is an unemployment rate of 17%. It is a scandal that this route has been ignored completely. I refer in particular to the N2 between Dublin and Aughnacloy.</P>

      <P>It is mainly those organisations, but also others, which have done an enormous amount of work in highlighting the areas of staffing, recruitment, planning issues in terms of one planning zone, how work can most effectively be done and how project teams can operate. They have put forward a number of other useful suggestions over the past year or so since the launch of the national plan. These organisations also have views about the tendering process. The Government has been very concerned about the lack of ability to move in terms of contract prices and ensuring more competition in the tendering process. I have already spoken about tenders from outside the country. All of these issues have been put forward publicly and at meetings with Ministers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>There have been 14 formal and informal meetings of the EU Culture Ministers since June 1997, five of which I have attended personally. The informal meetings that I was unable to attend were attended by senior officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>The main culture items on the formal Council agenda over the period 1997-2000 have been the adoption of the single framework programme for culture &ndash; Culture 2000 &ndash; with a budget of 167 million euros over the period 2000-04 and the decision on the capital of culture event for the period 2005-19. The main political debate on these two items took place at the formal Council meeting on 17 November 1998 which I attended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the audio visual side the main focus has been on the development of a new audio visual programme, MEDIA PLUS, which is still under discussion and which will be the main item on the agenda for the Council of Ministers later this month under the auspices of the French Presidency which I will be attending. Public service broadcasting and the funding of public service broadcasters is also a matter of current debate <Col N="1363" /> under the French Presidency which will submit a report to the Council later this month.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Ireland's interests were represented satisfactorily at the Council of Ministers meetings since I took office.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister answered a question here recently in which she said she had attended five of the 13 formal and informal meetings. I raise this question in light of her recent comments in Boston regarding the impact which the EU has on our cultural institutions. Following the Minister's statement did she attend the meeting of the Culture Council? Will she attend the forthcoming meeting on 25 November?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply I will attend the meeting which will discuss the agenda of MEDIA PLUS. The question of attendance at meetings depends on my commitments. Obviously there will be occasions on which there will be a clash of diary commitments, for example, the last two EU Council meetings on 16 May 2000 and 26 September 2000. On 16 May I was in Washington because I was in the United States for the opening of the Island Arts for Ireland's Festival. We are very much involved in that festival. This Government gave tremendous financial support to that project which was initiated by Jean Kennedy Smith. We wished to be of assistance there both financially and in many other ways. On 26 September I could not attend the EU Council meeting because I was otherwise engaged in a North-South Ministerial Council which took precedence. This will happen from time to time. Certainly when major decisions have been taken I have been in attendance. I intend to be at the next meeting which will have particular reference to MEDIA PLUS, a matter which is being negotiating. I will be interested to hear the report on public service broadcasters which is a matter of concern to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister has not attended a formal EU Culture Council meeting for two years will she agree that is hardly satisfactory in the national interest? Is it a fact that of the last four formal meetings of the Culture Council the Irish delegation was led by the deputy head of the Embassy to the EU? In general terms, given that only five meetings have been attended is that sending good vibes to our colleagues in Europe? Is there a danger that the Council will look on the Irish involvement at ministerial level as being casual and that Irish items will be treated in a casual fashion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The answer to his second question is that the deputy permanent representative was in attendance at the meeting. The answer to his third question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If the Minister does not attend one of these meetings does she inform herself of what takes place at the meeting? Who represented Ireland at that meeting? Was consideration given to a Minister of State representing the country? If the Minister is concerned about the implications of decisions made in Europe would it not be appropriate that she would have some input into those meetings? Irrespective of whether major decisions were made the meetings have a build up to a major decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy we always see the agenda before these meetings take place. If it is impossible for us to attend meetings due to other commitments and other priorities where major decisions are not being made, obviously the information is relayed back to us through the usual channels. The deputy permanent representative would represent any Minister who cannot be at such meetings. On the occasion of the last meeting on 26 September neither the Minister of State nor I could attend because our priority was to attend the North-South meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister open to criticism that her diary is not being dealt with in the most efficient manner if there are clashes between various important meetings? Is the Minister telling us indirectly that the presence of Ministers at EU Council meetings is not really important, that business goes ahead anyway? Can we take it from her infrequent attendance at these meetings that she is making a statement in terms of her scepticism in regard to European integration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question posed by the Deputy is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. His second question related to the business which takes place at these meetings. Decisions are not always taken at those meetings as I am sure the Deputy will understand. There are a number of issues on which lengthy negotiation takes place. Having served the European Parliament for five years I am aware that decisions in Europe are not taken quickly. Negotiations take place and we are kept informed of those. The answer to the Deputy's third question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that not all the Minister's colleagues are as lax in their attendance at Council meetings as the Minister. Some have 100% attendance. Taking her logic, is it the case that these Ministers are wasting their time attending such meetings whereas she is involved in much more important activities? Has the Minister a problem with her diary? Surely the formal meetings of the EU Culture Council are flagged well in advance. What meetings are more important than those of the EU Culture Council <Col N="1365" /> in terms of developing the whole remit of her Department and making sure Ireland benefits to the best possible level in terms of EU funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept I am lax in my responsibilities as Minister. With regard to the priorities of other Departments, it is not for me to comment. Obviously each Minister will look at his or her responsibilities and decide how they are best addressed both at home and in Brussels. I have no problem with my diary. The Deputy asked what meetings are more important to attend. For example, I would certainly put the North-South Ministerial Council meeting above the EU Council meeting of 26 September in terms of its agenda. If the Deputy had been in my place I wonder whether he would have attended that Council meeting or the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>

They would cause me some concern but, as yet, we do not have the full debate before us. When we do I will look at that matter very carefully.

      <P>Section 16 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, sets out the general functions of the RTE Authority. Section 17 of that Act, as amended by section 13 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, sets out RTE's general duty with regard to its programming. These two sections form the basis of RTE's statutory public service remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am on record, here and in European Union fora, as saying that the argument for maintaining and supporting a strong public service broadcasting service is stronger today than ever. I am also on record as saying that while I fully support the concept of public service broadcasting, as we have known it, this does not mean that nothing should change. New technologies offer the opportunity to do things more efficiently. In the current financial year, licence fee revenue accruing to RTE <Col N="1366" /> will be in excess of £67 million. Not unreasonably, licence holders must be reassured that the licence fee revenue is well spent and that the authority meets its statutory obligations in the most cost-effective manner.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, vital that RTE constantly reviews its own approaches and practices, which, even if they were appropriate in the past, may not be appropriate for the challenges of the present and future. In the new, highly competitive environment, the television licence payer ought not be expected to subsidise out-of-date approaches and practices. It is my intention to review the application for a licence fee increase in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>In her reply, the Minister said that licence fee payers will be reassured, but how does she intend to reassure them? At the moment there is not enough accountability and transparency as to how the licence fee is spent. The Minister also mentioned out-of-date practices. Will she elaborate on that comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All these issues have to be examined in an era of new technology which offers great opportunities to do things much more efficiently. We have to look not only at the licence fee but also at the workings of RTE and every other organisation that benefits from public funds, to ensure the utmost efficiency, which is obviously expected of them. We are talking about public moneys which we must ensure are spent in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>
      <P>The approach that has been taken by RTE is certainly more accessible to the reader who would be interested in knowing exactly how moneys are spent within that organisation. RTE's annual reports can be found by any public representative in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>When we are examining whether an increase in the licence fee is warranted, we look carefully at any submission made by RTE. I was given a formal outline application on 5 October. Further information, including much more detailed documentation, came to my office on 31 October. I am looking at that proposal and I am most concerned to have an objective and independent evaluation of it. We all know the tremendous competition that exists in the broadcasting sector, and we also know the tremendous level of high standards and high quality work that RTE produces. We would obviously wish that to continue. It is axiomatic that the organisation charged with delivering this service is adequately funded as well as being properly organised. I am sure each Member of the House will agree with me on that point.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the words &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; and &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, but is she satisfied that at present the licence fee funding is spent in such a manner? What procedures will be put in place so that we can review RTE's spending? The Minister said that documents are available in the Oireachtas Library, but is she happy that the <Col N="1367" /> information in those documents is transparent and appears there in total?</P>

      <P>With regard to the efficiency of RTE, the company has taken into account the need to reassess its organisation. It is important for every organisation to do so from time to time. Restructuring in RTE is a matter for that company and not for me, as Minister. Everyone knows that work is continuing to be carried out to make that organisation even more efficient. RTE is engaged in a cost-cutting exercise at present and I understand it hopes to reduce the numbers employed in the station by 330 by 2003.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other issue the Deputy mentioned, it is standard practice for such information to be made available. We are talking about public funds and RTE has gone to great lengths to ensure there is more transparency and accessibility.</P>

De réir mar a thuigim, sin a tharlaíonn. Tarlaíonn sé <Col N="1369" /> go bhfuil an dara cathair is mó sa tír i gcúige Uladh. Mar sin, tá riar mhór gasúir ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Glacaim leis san am atá caite go raibh deacracht o thaobh airgid de ag muintir Thuaisceart Éireann dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht, ach ar dhá chuis níl sé sin fíor.

Má thograíonn siad gan táille ard a ghearradh agus gan mórán airgid a íoc do na mná tí agus má ghlacann mná tí le sin, sin cheist dóibh siúd. Ní ghlacaim go bhfuil aon phrionsabal i gceist anseo agus ní ghlacaim leis ach oiread go mba cheart go mbéadh aon deacracht ag muintir chúige Uladh ó thaobh gasúir a mhealladh thar mar a bhéadh ag aon Ghaeltacht eile.

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the reason a meeting, agreed between Dúchas and the Shannon Callows Negotiation Group, following their meetings of 24 and 26 June 1999, has not taken place at which the terms of reference on the way in which compensation for losses as a result of designation of SPA would have been finalised; and the further reason there has been no contact between the parties since.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25671/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has successfully completed negotiations on prescriptions for Burren habitats, blanket bogs, heaths, upland grassland, sand dunes and machair. A number of other habitats, including callows, have yet to be agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of both Departments have met organisations representing the Shannon Callows farmers on numerous occasions over the past few years. I visited the callows and attended a meeting in Banagher on 29 October 1999. At a meeting between the officials and farmers' representatives held in February 2000, agreement in principle was reached on the prescriptions which would be applied to the Shannon Callows and other similar lands. It was also agreed to prepare a number of farm plans on a pilot basis. These plans would apply the prescriptions and indicate <Col N="1370" /> the financial implications arising on the sample farms and, therefore, the appropriate compensation in these cases.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged a further meeting would take place once the plans were completed at which any necessary refinement of the prescriptions in light of the results could be discussed. Unfortunately, the farmers subsequently refused permission to have the plans prepared on their lands. Officials of my Department met the relevant farm organisations on 2 November 2000 and it was agreed that prescriptions for habitats other than callows should be progressed as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is grossly unfair for the Minister to state that permission for the plans was not available from the participants in the pilot scheme. If it was desired to introduce confusion, the Minister and her officials have succeeded in doing so. She has not said why the meeting arranged and granted following the meeting of 24 June did not take place. The minutes of the meeting of 24 June do not represent truthfully what took place. As a consequence of not holding the agreed meeting, the Minister and her officials have availed of the opportunity to impose criteria for agreement.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate clearly why she has not agreed the terms of compensation? The Minister of State was present with me as far back as 1997 in Hayden's Hotel in Ballinasloe where he met the group in question and said that money was not an obstacle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern on this issue. Both the Minister of State and I want to see this matter resolved. I have met this group on more than one occasion. If the farmers' representatives were to agree either to have the pilot farms prepared or to dispense with the need for these as a basis for final agreement on the habitats prescriptions, there could certainly be progress. The purpose of the prescriptions, and this comes down to the question on compensation which I will answer, is that the plans would be used to calculate any income loss arising from the designations of SACs and SPAs and, consequently, the compensation, if any, due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the Department did not accept the plans prepared by the farmers was that the prescriptions were more severe than those envisaged by my Department and went beyond those necessary to maintain the favourable conservation status of these lands. The plans were, therefore, unacceptable. As I said in my initial reply, officials of my Department then met the relevant farm organisations and it was agreed that, because agreement could not, unfortunately, be reached on this issue, the prescription for other <Col N="1371" /> habitats should be progressed as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Like the Deputy, we would like to see this matter resolved. The reason for the disagreement is that the farmers' representatives have not been able to agree, for their own reasons, to have the pilot farm plans prepared. If this were done, it would expedite the matter immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair for the Minister to suggest that the participants withdrew their consent? That is the kernel of the issue. It did not happen. The reason was a failure by departmental officials to give adequate notification prior to visiting one farm identified as a pilot scheme. There was no preparation or notification because of the suddenness of the visit. It is grossly unfair for the Minister's officials to state that the participants withdrew their consent and to use that in a global fashion as has been done.</P>
      <P>To rebuild whatever bridges have been damaged, the Minister should immediately instruct her officials to contact all the participants involved and re-establish negotiations so that the matter can be dealt with. They are being left out.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I was under the impression the pilot scheme had been carried out but obviously my information is incorrect. Does the Minister agree that, unless there is a plan for local and regional museums which links them to the National Museum and which is underpinned by standards, valuable collections will continue to be inadequately cared for and premises will not be of a sufficient standard to display objects on loan from the National Museum, such as those currently in storage? Does <Col N="1372" /> she further agree that, in terms of sharing our heritage evenly and bringing about a greater appreciation of that heritage, funding must be provided and that the accreditation and standardisation system must be put in place as a matter of urgency?</P>

I await the outcome and evaluation of the pilot scheme with great interest. The Deputy will be glad to hear that the draft heritage plan which I am compiling will include a provision for an independent system of quality assurance at local and national levels.

Does the Minister agree that the fact the National Museum is not open on bank <Col N="1374" /> holiday Mondays, for example, denies people, particularly young people from all over the country, the opportunity to view the artefacts on display? Does she further agree that, in these days of increased leisure time, it is inexcusable that she has been dithering on this issue and that no progress has been made in terms of wider access to that part of our national heritage housed in the National Museum?</P>

      <P>It is a pity the Deputy did not remind the previous incumbent of this office of the need for funding for national institutions. These institutions are still at a low base and need to be improved. However, there has been a substantial increase in funding for each of the institutions since this Government took office whereas little or no attention was paid to them previously. This underlines the fact that the Government views these institutions as playing a key role in our heritage and culture.</P>
      <P>Members will be interested to hear of the kind of moneys we are talking about. We would like to be in a position to open the museum for longer hours and on bank holiday Mondays and to improve access in any way possible. The current Sunday opening hours are from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. It is estimated that increasing this opening time from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. would cost £63,000 per annum. Late opening from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. one night per week would cost an estimated £70,000 per annum. Opening on bank holiday Mondays would cost £6,000 per day.</P>

Is it not criminal? Now that she has had it costed, it is not a great deal of money but she will still not indicate that she will extend the opening hours of the National Museum.

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 101, 108, 117, 124, 135 agus 143 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Bhunaigh an Rialtas Coimisiún faoin nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht níos luaithe i mbliana chun moltaí a dhéanamh maidir leis an nGaeilge a láidriú mar ghnáthurlabhra phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá téarmaí tagartha leathan tugtha don choimisiún. Mar chuid de na téarmaí tagartha sin déanfaidh an coimisiún tomhas ar a mhéid is atá an Ghaeilge in úsáid mar theanga labhartha sna limistéir éagsúla Ghaeltachta. Gan amhras ní bheadh an coimisiún seo ann murach gur cheap an Rialtas go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag cúlú sa Ghaeltacht in ainneoin na n-iarrachtaí atá déanta go dáta. É sin ráite caithfear fanacht ar thuarascáil an choimisiúin chun pictiúr níos cruinne a thabhairt dúinn maidir le stáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht anois.</P>
      <P>Tuigim ón gcathaoirleach go raibh cúig chruinniú acu go dáta &ndash; dhá cheann i nGaillimh agus ceann amháin i gCiarraí, Dún na nGall agus Baile Átha Cliath araon. Táthar sásta leis an dul chun cinn go dáta ach mar a dúirt mé tá téarmaí tagartha leathan tugtha don choimisiún agus tá sé mar sprioc acu na téarmaí sin a chomhlíonadh go cuimsitheach ó bhun go barr. Ní féidir a rá go beacht ag an bpointe seo cathain a bheidh an coimisiún réidh chun tuarascáil dheiridh a chur faoi bhráid an Rialtais. Is ceist í don Rialtas ina dhiaidh sin an tuarascáil a chur ar fáil go poiblí.</P>
      <P>Maidir le cruinnithe poiblí, tuigim go bhfuil i gceist ag an gcoimisiún gach seans a thabhairt don phobal tuairimí agus moltaí a chur ar aghaidh. Tá os cionn ceithre scór aighneacht faighte acu go dáta. Tuigim go bhfuil i gceist ag an gcoimisiún sraith cruinnithe a eagrú sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh di chun deis a thabhairt don phobal aighneachtaí ó bhéal a chur faoi bhráid an choimisiúin. Cuireadh tús leis na cruinnithe poiblí sin an tseachtain seo. Mar eolas don Teachta Mac Fhionnlaoich eagraíodh cruinnithe go háitiúil i nDún na nGall faoi obair an choimisiúin agus cuireadh moltaí faoi bhráid an choimisiúin. Beidh i gceist cruinnithe poiblí a eagrú i nDún na nGall ó mhí Eanáir 2001.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an nGaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, tá sé deacair a rá go cruinn an bhfuil fás ag teacht ar a húsáid. Léiríonn tuairiscí éagsúla faoin ábhar seo go bhfuil bunsraith mhaith sa phobal i dtaca le cumas agus labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>

Cén fáth díreach a deir sé é sin? An bhfuil sé ag rá gur saothar in aisce é Coimisiún na Gaeltachta nuair atá ráitis mar sin ag teacht amach uaidh? Agus os rud é go bhfuil tromlach na ndaoine a labhrann Gaeilge uair amháin sa ló lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht an <Col N="1377" /> bhfuil aon scéim ar intinn ag an Aire Stáit chun scéal na Gaeilge sa Ghalltacht a mheas agus chun an teanga a fhorbairt agus a chaomhnú sna háiteanna sin? </P>

Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, dúirt mé má chineann an ghlúin seo go bhfuil an rogha sin acu, mar tá Béarla ag chuile dhuine sa Ghaeltacht, Gaeilge a labhairt len a gclann mairfidh sí go deo. Tá sé chomh simplí leis sin. Is fíric é sin go gcaithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt air. Caithfimid scrúdú a dhéanamh mar chuid d'obair an Choimisiúin cén fáth go bhfuil an oiread de phobal agus de thuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta ag labhairt Béarla len a gclann mar chéad theanga. Caithfear é sin a scrúdú ach ag deireadh an lae is é pobal na Gaeltachta féin a dhéanfaidh cinneadh faoi sin. Sin an rud a dúirt mé agus seasaim leis sin mar dhuine a bhfuil cónaí air sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an dara cheist, tá Foras na Gaeilge ann mar chuid den Foras Tras-Teorann Teanga. Tá dualgas mór curtha orthu siúd eolas cuimsitheach a bhailiú maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge agus freisin, rud níos tábhachtaí fós, bealaigh a aimsiú le cur len a húsáid ar fud na tíre uilig.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom a shoiléiriú gur beag airgid a chaitear sa Ghaeltacht nach gcaithfí sa Ghaeltacht ar aon chaoi fiú muna mbeadh an Ghaeltacht ann. Mar chuid mhaith den airgead a áiríteart leis an Ghaeltacht baineann sé le bóithre, le céibheanna agus le rudaí mar sin a bhfuil fáil ag chuile dhuine sa tír orthu. Mar shampla, bunáit an airgid a tugtar d'Údarás na Gaeltachta, caitear ar chúrsaí tionscail é. Níl aon bhaint aige sin le Gaeilge <i>per se. </i>Ba mhaith liom níos mó den chaiteachas sa Ghaeltacht a fheiceáil caite ar an teanga agus tá an cheist sin pléite agam le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta le gairid. Ach is bréag é agus is bréag é a scaiptear go forleathan, go bhfuil an t-uafás airgid á chaitheamh ar theanga na Gaeilge sa Ghael<Col N="1378" /> tacht nó go bhfuil mórán buntáiste ag pobal na Gaeltachta thar aon phobal eile sa tír.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na pobail taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, is é an chaoi a bhfuil an scéal ná go bhfuil dul chun cinn áirithe déanta i gceantracha áirithe agus ní dóigh liom gur cheart áiféal a dhéanamh de sin. Tá ceann acu i do cheantar féin. Ceann de mhór-rólanna Fhoras na Teanga ná cur leis sin agus déanamh cinnte go ndéanfar forbairt ar sin. Tá airgead á chur ar fáil ag an Rialtas chuige sin. Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte nuair a bheidh an Foras Teanga ag obair i gceart go gcuirfear dlús mór leis an obair atá ar bun ag an bhForas Teanga le hais mar a bhí ag Bord na Gaeilge roimhe mar beidh na deiseanna acu an obair a dhéanamh go críochniúil agus go slactmhar.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an cheist a chuir an Teachta faoin Rialtas is dóigh liom go bhfuil níos mó déanta ag an Rialtas seo ó thaobh reachtaíocht le tacaíocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge &ndash; an Bille Oideachais, an Bille Pleanála agus mar sin de &ndash; ná mar a rinne aon Rialtas roimhe.</P>

An aontaíonn sé go bhfuil cuid den locht agus den bhfreagracht ar na heagrais agus ar na Ranna Stáit féin. Go minic bíonn sé an-deacair ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh i nGaeilge nuair a chuirtear san áireamh na seirbhísí sláinte, seirbhísí leighis, seirbhísí oideachais agus fiú amháin seirbhís a thagair an tAire Stáit féin dí an lá faoi dheireadh, ón mBord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Nuair a éilíonn siad go mbéadh éisteachtaí poiblí i mBéarla sa Ghaeltacht nach n-aontaíonn an tAire Stáit go bhfuil go leor den locht ar na seirbhísí agus na Ranna Stáit a chuireann na seirbhísí ar fáil.

Maidir le Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge de, ní raibh gasúir na Gaeltachta incháilithe don deontas sin go dtáinig mise isteach mar Aire. D'athraigh mé na rialacha go bhféadfadh gasúir ón Ghaeltacht freastal ar Choláistí Gaeilge le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge muna raibh Gaeilge acu.

      <P>Maidir le Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge de, is é an t-iomlán a íoctar faoin scéim sin le teaghlach iomlán ná £200 in aghaidh na bliana mar uasmhéid. Má cheapann daoine go bhfuil na teaghlaigh ag déanamh saibhris ar sin caithfidh nach bhfuil tuiscint acu ar luach airgid an lae inniu. Mar sin, níl sé fíor ar aon bhealach go bhfuil mór-chuid airgid á chaitheamh nó mórán buntáiste ag pobal na Gaeltachta ó thaobh na heacnamaíochta de thar mar atá ag an chuid eile den tír. Is cineál finscéal é seo go bhfuil an t-uafás airgid á chaitheamh sa Ghaetlacht sa bhreis ar an méid airgid atá á chaitheamh ar chuile phobal sa tír. Dá ndéanfaí é seo a scrúdú i gceart gheobhfaí amach go bhfuil go leor de phobal na Gaeltachta ann nach bhfuair cothrom na Féinne ó thaobh chaiteachas an Stáit riamh.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last March the ASTI lodged a claim for a straight 30% across the board increase in pay. It was not satisfied with the offer made in direct negotiations with my Department and referred its claim to the agreed teachers' arbitration board. The arbitration board rejected the 30% claim and recommended that the pay terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness should be applied to ASTI members in common with other teachers and other public servants. I moved immediately to apply the arbitration board's finding to ASTI members.</P>
      <P>The application of the pay terms of the PPF and the associated early settlers agreement to ASTI member means a cumulative pay increase of 19.2% within a two year period, beginning with an 8.5% pay increase effective from 1 October last. Cheques which issued to the ASTI members on 18 October included the 8.5% increase. The PPF also provides for significant tax concessions in the region of 10% which, taken together with the pay increases, amounts to 29.2%. There is also provision for an additional 1,400 teaching posts in second level schools, 1,000 of which are being allocated in the current year. All these posts will be allocated before Christmas. In addition to these guaranteed improvements, teachers will also be able to process their case for a further pay increase through the public service benchmarking body, which is being set up to undertake a fundamental examination of public service pay and jobs <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector. This is an innovative and creative development which will address the issues of concern to the ASTI, other unions and the public service in general. This benchmarking body has already completed a great deal of the preparatory work in preparation for its first formal meeting on Monday next. This is a major development within the partnership process which begins on Monday next. This indicates the urgency with which the Government and the social partners are addressing the new benchmarking process. This is why I want all teachers, including ASTI members, to be on board at this critical time. I do not want to see any teacher left outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ASTI members' action in withdrawing from supervision and refusal to substitute for <Col N="1383" /> absent colleagues has had the direct result of schools not being able to operate. In these circumstances, I could not justify to the general taxpayers, particularly the parents of the children, the payment of £1.2 million per day to ASTI members while children are not being taught. I do not understand how people who cause schools to be closed to children could expect to be paid. I have already notified the ASTI that payment will not be made for these days.</P>
    <P>Teachers do very valuable work and should be paid accordingly. That is what I want to achieve and it can be done through the benchmarking process. The Government is of one mind on this issue and it is firmly of the view that the solution to the present dispute lies within the well established framework of social partnership and, in particular, within the framework of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We cannot and must not break the PPF. Partnership has served our people well and it is the foundation on which the future of our children rests. The ASTI campaign of industrial action is unnecessary. I again call on the ASTI to reconsider its future proposed actions, the effects of this on young people and their parents and to re-enter the partnership process.</P>
    <P>The higher diploma in education programme is offered by the four universities of the National University of Ireland at Dublin, Cork, Galway and Maynooth and by Trinity College Dublin. Since 1999, the four universities of the NUI have operated a centralised application system for entry to the higher diploma in education programmes. Applications continue to be made directly to the college in the case of Trinity College Dublin. While there is a decrease in the number of applications for the H.Dip. over the past two years, the position remains that the demand for places far exceeds supply, with more than two applicants for every place in the NUI colleges and almost four applicants for each place offered by Trinity College Dublin. Therefore, the number of applications for the H.Dip. is approximately double the number of places available. The total intake into the H.Dip. has increased by 25% in the past two years from 800 to 1,000 per annum. I am not aware of any major difficulties in recruiting second level teachers generally at present. There are difficulties in some areas such as physics and chemistry. In addition, almost 1,100 new appointments for voluntary secondary schools have been approved since 1 August last in delivering the promises of the PPF.</P>

      <P>This morning I listened to the Minister on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; use a phrase which I would like him to explain. He spoke about the possibility of some interim measures being put in place to deal with this dispute. Will he clarify precisely what he meant by that? Does he accept that the benchmarking process under the PPF at best will deliver in mid-2003 and that this timescale is completely unacceptable to <Col N="1384" /> teachers? In that context, does he see any scope for bringing forward that benchmarking process so that something is delivered under it, say, by June 2001? Is this what he was suggesting in his interview this morning, or what did he mean? </P>

      <P>Should the benchmarking body consider interim measures, such as the question of the timescale raised by Deputies Shortall and Kenny, for implementation across the public service, it would be a matter for the PPF to consider such proposals and give a decision on them. The INTO and TUI within the PPF and the ASTI outside it, have expressed a desire to have such matters advanced. Initially this was regarded as a totally new method and a creative idea. Preparatory work has been done and it will be for the partners in the PPF to decide how early this can be brought forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said teachers do valuable work and should be paid accordingly. Is the Minister aware that a recent OECD report <Col N="1385" /> showed a gap of £8,000 between the earnings of a secondary teacher in Ireland after 15 years service and the earnings of other graduate employees after the same length of service? Is he also aware that the Joint Committee on Education and Science has published a number of reports, including one on the shortage of science teachers? Can he say he has examined the problem of teacher shortages in detail, in view of the fact that second level and primary schools are finding it difficult to fill vacancies? The Minister says he has allocated an additional 1,000 places. What can he say to the many schools which will find difficulty in filling those places? Will he use the opportunity of this dispute to make sure teaching is not considered the poor man's profession in future?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment has been reduced to less than 3.7%. There is a great opportunity to pick and choose. The Government and the other PPF partners have created a difficulty by adding 2,500 places at the request of the teachers. Of these extra places, 1,400 are at second level and 1,100 are at primary level. The purpose of the extra second level places was to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 18:1, which is the current ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a major reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio. Since August last, 1,100 extra teachers have been recruited. There are shortages in particular areas such as physics and chemistry. The shortage of teachers of physics and chemistry, which we are addressing, is a problem found in every country in Europe except Greece, where the situation is very different. The numbers in colleges of education and in higher diploma in education courses are being increased to meet these requirements and newly qualified teachers are now taking up jobs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent also asked about the OECD report. The table to which the Deputy refers does not take into consideration the awards for a degree, an honours degree and a higher diploma in education which are standard in Ireland. These must be considered if accurate comparisons are to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers do an excellent job and are very important to us. That is why they will receive an increase of 19.2% under the PPF. With everyone else they will receive a 10% reduction in tax. This tax reduction is important because the money in our pockets is affected by the level of tax we pay. This amounts to a 29.2% increase over a two year period. Questions have been raised about the level of inflation this year. The partners are <Col N="1386" /> examining this problem urgently in an effort to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There is concern about benchmarking. This is a new approach taken by the partners.</P>

        <b>: </b>In view of the fact that the Minister has agreed that the secondary school teachers' demand of 30% over three years includes 19% already agreed in the partnership agreement, does the Minister agree that the real claim is for 11% over three years? Does the Minister agree that the 19% has been wiped out by inflation before it arrives in the pockets of teachers and other workers? At the end of the three year deal, teachers and others are facing a fall in their real living standards. Therefore, the demand for extra money is justified.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister for Education and Science agree that so-called partnership is a sham under which professions in the public sector, such as teaching, have been hammered in terms of wage increases while the Government allowed speculators to profiteer outrageously, for example, doubling and trebling the price of a home? Does the Minister believe that young teachers should have the right to purchase a home? If so, how does he expect them to do so when they cannot afford a house on their current wages and he is not prepared to concede a realistic increase?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the latest buzzword, &ldquo;benchmarking&rdquo;, is a crude attempt to force the often brutal methods of the market into the public sector? It is totally inappropriate, particularly in relation to teaching and education. How does one compare the value of a teacher, trying to give a difficult, semi-literate 13 year old child full literacy and ensure he or she plays a useful and positive role in society, to a whiz-kid sitting at a desk in the Financial Services Centre, speculating on the future markets in the stock exchanges of the world?

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows no regard for or interest in pupils, teachers or parents. Arising from the Minister's long reply, I wish to ask a number of questions. The Minister said he is available to meet teachers, but only within the terms of the PPF. How many times has the Minister met the ASTI since last March? Were those meetings inside the PPF?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave the distinct impression in a nervous interview this morning that interim <Col N="1389" /> measures could be brought forward next year outside the benchmarking process because nobody knows what that will involve at this stage. Will the Minister clarify and put flesh on the bones of his interim measures?</P>
    <P>What arrangements are being made so that courses which are long, detailed and regimental can be concluded in secondary schools? The action today and on future days will mean that courses cannot be concluded and students are tearing out their hair as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister has briefed the Government on this matter. Has he proposed to the Government the bringing forward of the benchmarking dates and, more importantly, the payment dates allowed under the clause in the PPF? The Minister mentioned productivity. Has the Minister briefed the Government on the issues involved in productivity in this area and that teachers who attain recognised and independent standards of excellence should be rewarded as a result? What are his views in that regard?</P>
    <P>Given that the Cromien report is a scathing indictment of the Department over which the Minister presides and that there are deep structural frustrations within the teaching profession in general, does the Minister intend to use this opportunity to sort out this matter once and for all in everybody's interest?</P>

However, I must make it clear, and be honest, forthright and straightforward, that the Government is committed to the PPF. There are ways within the PPF in which issues can be resolved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned outside benchmarking. I did not refer to that. I was aware that both the INTO and the TUI had made proposals about advancing benchmarking just as they had made proposals about inflation this year. These are being urgently considered by the partners. All those matters are open to consideration at this time.</P>
      <P>The fourth question was about the courses being too long. The NCCA assesses the courses. I am concerned about some of the courses and I will consider that.</P>

I have kept the Government fully informed of the current situation and of any suggestions or proposals I might have. The Government and the Taoiseach in particular are aware of what is happening among the partners.</P>

Does he accept that one of the strong points of our education system is that a large number of teachers contribute generously to activities, such as sports, musical productions, debating and school tours, outside school hours and that the goodwill which underlies such an important activity is likely to be irreparably damaged by his threat?

      <P>As regards the teaching profession, I am trying to get the teaching profession Bill, which would strengthen the profession, back into the House and I would be delighted if the House discussed it. There is no doubt the problems can be resolved within the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Teachers have taken up a substantial offer from October and there is more to come, including the tax package. Further benchmarking will start next Monday. It is better to participate in the benchmarking system and to influence it from the inside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If that answer was corrected in the leaving certificate, it would not get a high benchmark. The Minister is the political head of a Department and a profession which is deeply <Col N="1393" /> demoralised, frustrated and unattractive. How does he propose to make up the time on courses which cannot and will not be followed when this dispute runs its course? The curriculum examinations board will not have an answer. What proposals does the Minister have to make up the time, particularly for examination students who will lose out? Given that this is the first shot in what could become a nasty series of disputes and that the State is obliged by law to organise examinations, what contingency plans has the Minister put in place to ensure that becomes a reality? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have visited many schools and I do not find teachers demoralised. They are doing an excellent job. About 40,000 have enrolled on IT courses involving new computer technology. That hardly represents a demoralisation &ndash; indeed, teachers are very enthusiastic about these courses and are doing an excellent job with them.</P>
      <P>The real question is what should be the position of teachers in the public service. To address that the benchmarking process is available and is commencing next Monday.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the examinations and I believe teachers are also concerned about students preparing for them. That matter can be best resolved by reaching a settlement agreement with the social partners at the earliest possible time.</P>
      <P>We will have to consider what action to take if the dispute becomes prolonged. I hope the teachers will not put school children in that position, but that remains to be seen. It will be clear to the teachers that the partners have made very substantial proposals and that the benchmarking process is a genuine system for workers and professionals within the public service. In that context I am hopeful that the issue can be resolved.</P>

Alternatively, will he indicate if he is offering something by way of an olive branch in that regard? Does he accept that no other public sector professional group has a salary scale as long as teachers, with a starting point of £14,809 before reaching a maximum of £28,784 after 23 years of service? Will he be in a position to tell teachers that this will change in an effort to bring the dispute to a conclusion by getting people around the negotiating table? Can he offer teachers anything at this point or is he simply going to play hardball and wait for the education system to crumble, to the consternation of pupils and parents as well as teachers?</P>

      <P>Having this morning spoken to picketers outside seven schools in my constituency I assure the Minister that his jackboot tactics regarding the voluntary work undertaken by teachers has exacerbated matters.

      <P>We held a short debate on this matter last week. The report of the chief medical officers at the Department of Health and Children into the three clinical trials involving residents of children's homes was laid before the Houses on Thursday by the Minister for Health and Children. Questions were raised in regard to the ethical propriety of these clinical trials and whether appropriate consent had been obtained on various occasions from 1960 onwards. In order to obtain answers to the many unanswered ques<Col N="1397" /> tions in the report, the Minister sent a report to the Laffoy Commission established to investigate child abuse and further proposes to refer the report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for its consideration.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that the report's referral to the Laffoy Commission would be the most effective method of establishing the full truth in this matter as it has powers which enable it to comprehensively investigate all the issues involved. As to the legality of its referral, the Minister has been advised that the commission has adequate powers. Deputy Shortall asked me last week whether the commission could deal with matters out of sequence and the answer is that it can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party wishes to facilitate this report's referral to the Laffoy Commission but we want that referral to prove effective. We are concerned about the legality of this report being dealt with by the Laffoy Commission. It would be very disturbing if a legal challenge were mounted to this referral at any stage. It appears to us that the Act's terms of reference do not permit this type of referral. Will the Taoiseach consider drafting an order which would be quite specific in regard to the House's intention? I would be happy to table an amendment in this regard, should that be necessary. It would be very simple for the Taoiseach to draft an order specifying the referral so that there would be no question of a legal challenge being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is somewhat similar to that expressed by other Deputies. If the Laffoy Commission is to be empowered to consider the entire question of abuse, a separate question remains to be addressed. My amendment seeks to investigate whether there is any connection between a batch of vaccine used between 1968 and 1970 manufactured by the same company which caused adverse reactions, including brain damage, and the fact that tests were carried out in these institutions. This issue relates to a particular company and the Department of Health and Children. If this report is referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I would like it to be not only considered by the committee but also investigated and reported on with particular reference to the content of my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell is aware that I do not agree with the committee investigating <Col N="1398" /> the matter. I intend that it would only consider the report.</P>
      <P>On the points raised by Deputies Quinn and McManus, we received advice from the Attorney General and the report has been sent to the Laffoy Commission. The Deputies seem to be asking that we would double check the legality of such a referral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House shares a common concern that this matter would be dealt with properly and effectively and that there would be no ambiguity about it. Our legal advice is that in order to copperfasten the procedure, the following amendment should be tabled to the motion before the House. It would be a matter for the Government to accept the amendment. The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>And that Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their approval a draft of an order under section 4(4) of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, conferring on that commission (and, if appropriate, its committees) the function of receiving that report and inquiring into and reporting upon such matters raised in or in connection with that report as it may think fit, notwithstanding that the report does not deal with, or raise issues relating to, the abuse of children as defined for the purposes of that Act.</P>

When can we expect to see proposals on the issuance of licences in Dublin and other major cities? If legislation is required, the Fine Gael Party is willing to facilitate its being taken in the House this week and is willing to sit as long as necessary to facilitate its passage.

The High Court duly struck down the regulation. The final legal opinions have just been submitted to the Minister. It will not require legislation, but rather new orders and the Minister is working on these and will, hopefully, bring them forward as soon as possible, that is, in a matter of days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion when speaking on this Bill I was exchanging comparisons with my colleague Deputy Joe Higgins and attempting to point out that privatisation was not wrong in all cases. It is clearly the intention of Government at some stage in the not too distant future to sell ICC. In making comparisons we must recognise that business requirements change and, undoubtedly, will change again. We will not always have low interest rates, we may not always have an abundance of credit and we may not always have full employment as at present and, in such circumstances, it will be necessary to ensure a financial institution is ready and willing to provide for the markets previously provided for by the ICC.</P>
      <P>When we criticised money lenders in the course of praising credit unions and small banks, a local authority colleague pointed out that it was necessary to ensure that at all times there were people available in the lending business who would be prepared to lend to small industry when it might not be attractive to the major financial institutions. That is the point to which I wish to refer in some detail.</P>
      <P>Given modern banking methodology and that banking has become more impersonal it is possible to control a bank from a central location with nothing except automatic teller machines to deal with the public. Nothwithstanding advances in modern technology, it will always be important to ensure there is somebody to greet customers and who can answer to the consumer rather than a machine in a wall which either gives or refuses money. That may be an extreme comparison but it is a worthwhile one. I make it to emphasise the need to ensure a personal touch in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope in the course of whatever happens in the sale of this and other banks that whoever purchases the ICC would bear in mind the important <Col N="1406" /> niche market catered for in the past. There will be those who will say the world has changed dramatically and that it will not be necessary to cater in the same way as ICC did previously, and that there are more efficient methods of dealing with the situation that may arise. I am not so sure. We can rest assured that at some time in the future the economy will not perform as well as at present. There may be a shortage of finance, a scarcity of investment and there may be a great necessity for a loosening up of the lending agencies towards business, particularly small business. If that loosening does not take place it will be difficult for small businesses to exist. I stress the importance of that aspect.</P>
    <P>In the argument on public versus private ownership there is a good case for both. We should be careful of a monopoly, whether public or private, because there will always be an attempt to control the market. There are some utility services that are better provided by private enterprise and some that are better provided by public utility services. There is no situation in which one can say there shall be no adventure into privatisation on the one hand or into public ownership and enterprise on the other. On the last occasion on which a spate of nationalisations took place in the United Kingdom they did not work. I am not too sure that the present spate of privatisations is working either. The balance lies somewhere in the middle and we need to bear that in mind for the future.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the need for competition. When I was very young there was a multiplicity of banks so, in theory at least, there was competition. One could go to the Munster and Leinster Bank, the Bank of Ireland, the Hibernian Bank, the Royal Bank, the National Bank and a series of other banks. The amalgamation took place in order to achieve greater efficiency, better market impact and better delivery of services. The public tends to say now that there may not be as much competition in the market as there was. That is not necessarily a good thing. During any future reorganisation of banking institutions that may take place, we must keep in mind the necessity of ensuring competition, alternative views and an alternative methodology in respect of consumers, particularly business consumers. The economy will grow on the basis of the management and development of business and enterprise generally, and unemployment figures will depend on that also.</P>
    <P>We need to beware of banking institutions cherry-picking lucrative clients from the market tree and, thus, doing what we have tried to avoid in the health insurance sector, for example. The community rating in health insurance was specifically designed to avoid cherry-picking and to ensure the market was catered for by having a reasonable application of insurance cover across the board. I am not too sure that in future we will be able to eliminate the possibility of cherry-picking, whether by way of existing structures or proposed ones. Everybody will want to go for the <Col N="1407" /> prize by lending in what they see as the most lucrative area. That is human nature and it is driven by the need to ensure a return for investors. That does not necessarily mean, however, that there is an even spread, equal opportunity or equal availability of funding to equally deserving sectors.</P>
    <P>I do not have a problem with privatisation or the preparations for it. However, an assurance is required that the facilities and services currently provided by whatever structure is to be privatised, will continue to be provided in an equitable manner to all concerned. Just because we happen to be on the back of the Celtic tiger, we should not think it will roar on forever without assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for an increase in the authorised share capital of ICC and to put in place enabling provisions to facilitate its future sale. Whatever about the bank's future sale, it is important to authorise ICC's share capital, which is a welcome move. Over the years, the ICC Bank has been a major player in the growth of small companies when many other banks would not take such risks. The bank has been a great asset to small companies. I know from talking to people who have dealt with the ICC how it has supported such companies. Last year, a sale process was initiated in the House but it fell through. In the interim, the bank has carried out a review and has shown considerable profitability &ndash; up to £23 million &ndash; in the past year. To date the State has had a good return on its investment, so one would wonder about the necessity of selling the bank. We should be careful to whom we sell the bank because it could affect the growth of small companies. Up to now, the ICC Bank has catered for a niche market, unlike larger institutions, such as the Ulster Bank and the Bank of Ireland. It is clear that banks are devoid of sentiment and invest money to obtain a return. That is the bottom line for any banking institution, but the role of the ICC Bank in the growth of small towns has been due to the success of small companies it assisted. The role of the regular banks was different. For instance, it is reckoned that the Bank of Ireland in Ballymote has £20 million on deposit, but the amount of money given out locally in the area by the bank is very small. Lending facilities and cash on deposit would normally go through larger regional centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under American statute law, banks must distribute a certain amount of money in an area, depending on how much is collected in that area. The Government should examine that system. Banks are driven by profit and, clearly, the ICC Bank has played a role in the growth of the Celtic tiger. Nowadays, banks in smaller towns take in so much money on deposit, but they loan out very small amounts by comparison. I know several business people who went to local banks with fantastic ideas, but were told that their proposals <Col N="1408" /> were beyond the capability of the local branch and so they could not obtain funding. That is where the ICC Bank stepped in to provide equity which has been so beneficial to small businesses.</P>
    <P>The ICC Bank's current authorised share capital of £40 million has been largely subscribed to. The bank continues to grow and as long as it remains in public ownership the shareholder must provide the necessary share capital. This is one example of public ownership doing a good job because the ICC Bank has been successful in niche marketing. Few institutions are looking after small companies. We have Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the local enterprise boards. From my experience, the enterprise boards have very little funding &ndash; something like £20 million for all 26 boards. Some very good people are working for the enterprise boards but the funding for small companies is inadequate. The ICC Bank is independent and, while it is not devoid of proper banking criteria, it has a broader vision than other banks that are solely driven by the bottom line.</P>
    <P>In addition, the ICC Bank has the advantage of not dealing with day to day banking transactions across the counter. This week, the Bank of Ireland announced it was no longer cashing cheques unless they were crossed and paid into an account. This gives an indication of what banks can do in a cartel position. That is what is happening in the banking sector. If someone does not have a bank account he cannot cash a cheque. Cheques now have to be paid into an account and, therefore, it is being recommended that people open accounts.</P>
    <P>Retailers are the local bank in a real sense because they accept cheques without any guarantee and lodge them to their accounts, taking the risk of not being paid. The Bank of Ireland stated that cashing cheques takes too much time and that, rather than having people queuing up to have their wage cheques cashed, it would be better served by not cashing those cheques unless the people had an account with it or an associated institution. That was stated in the business section of last Saturday's newspaper. It was also stated that the regulation would be introduced by Bank of Ireland from this week.</P>
    <P>While small towns may have an Ulster Bank or other bank branch as well as a Bank of Ireland branch, a cartel is still in operation. For example, if it has a difficulty or a doubt one bank will ring its opposition to check on and benchmark different matters. The ICC is different in that it is geared for small and medium-sized enterprises. I appeal to the Minister that when the ICC is sold the development and growth of small Irish companies as part of its ethos will be enshrined in the deal.</P>
    <P>The greatest growth sector in Ireland is small companies. While a small company in France or Germany, for example, might have 300 to 400 staff, the definition of small companies in Ireland is completely different. We must never lose sight the importance of small and medium-sized <Col N="1409" /> enterprises. Any sector of the trade, whether manufacturing, retail or whatever else, is the backbone of the current economic success in Ireland. It is important that a lender has a vision for such development, but many of the banks in Ireland do not have such vision. They are driven by the PAYE worker's cheque lodged to his or her account with direct debits coming out automatically, so there is no real risk. Very few banks will take substantial risks. I am a major promoter of the ICC Bank because it has done good work.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the bank made pre-tax operating profit of £23 million and it announced its interim results in April of this year which showed pre-tax profit increasing by 64% to £80.3 million and the cost to income ratio reducing to 35.8% from 47% for the same period last year. This is an excellent performance by any standards from the point of view of where the bank is coming from and the market with which it deals. The Minister of State said that if a partner with huge equity is secured it will remove the burden from the State of having to invest in the bank. However, the results show the returns for investing in small companies. It is a good performance.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for an increase in the authorised share capital of the bank from its current limit of £40 million to £80 million. As the Minister already indicated in public, it is his intention to ensure the bank remains adequately capitalised as long as it remains in State ownership.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the role of the bank. It is important from the point of view of those working there that it is stated clearly that the bank is for sale. The &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign was removed when the previous sale fell through. Clearly, a cartel is emerging with insurance companies buying into banks and banks selling out to insurance companies. This is a market of 4 million people and, in terms of economies of scale, the population of Manchester would exceed that. We must be extraordinarily careful.</P>
    <P>Banks make £1 million in profit a day. Customers are charged for everything now. It can cost a business person up to £7 to lodge £1,000 to their account. It has nearly reached the stage where banks have a charge on the door. Barring that, a person is charged for everything else. If he or she wants copies of statements or an appointment or whatever, it is all charged and built into the account. Customers must pay all these charges. Inflation has been a topic for discussion and all these charges add to it because businesses, if they are to survive, must pass on these charges. Someone must pay them. I had a situation where a customer's cheque for £15 was referred and the bank made £15 on it, £7.50 from the retailer and £7.50 from the customer in bank charges.</P>
    <P>The most important function in a bank is the credit room because it monitors any exceeded limits or debits where additional charges can be applied. Any business with a reasonable turnover pays hundreds of pounds per week to service the bank. Those charges did not apply years ago <Col N="1410" /> when banks made money solely on interest. A breakdown of where they make their profits now would show that most of it is from built-in charges.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;interest charges&rdquo; is a misnomer. There is a domestic rate and a commercial rate and they are way beyond what banks would give customers &ndash; they are 3% to 4% beyond the normal buying rate. The banks are making huge returns. Rates are at 11% or 12% on overdraft facilities for businesses.</P>
    <P>That is why the role of ICC Bank in future is important. If it is sold to one of the main banks its independence will be lost. It will become part of the larger chain and part of the philosophy of getting a return on investment. The State should be paid handsomely for an asset which has served it well. It has helped small companies and has realised the dedication and commitment of entrepreneurial business people who began with nothing and little or no State aid or funding.</P>
    <P>No grants or benefits are available to the services sector. People in it work a 40 hour weekend, not a 40 hour week. People refer to and have a perception of those in business as &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; who make a great deal of money. However, many of my friends and colleagues in business work very hard and take all the risk under huge pressure.</P>
    <P>While I respect fully the Minister of State's position and am delighted with the equity being put into the ICC Bank, I am sure he is in no doubt about the role of the ICC to date and the huge amount of work it has done throughout the country. Many companies would not be successful today, whether in manufacturing, hotels or retailing, had the ICC not taken a risk when the associated banks would not. Most business people today do not want grants; the grant mentality is almost gone. What is needed is someone who will be sympathetic to an idea and to a region that needs growth. It is from small acorns that large oaks grow and that sums up the attitude of the ICC Bank. It has grown large oaks and has played a huge role in the development of the State over many years.</P>
    <P>While the State may be preoccupied with selling assets, we must be careful to achieve a balance and not to leave ourselves short of valuable assets.</P>
    <P>We have seen the situation with Eircom. Business is devoid of sentiment. ICC had a reasonable amount of sentiment but regardless of the benchmark put in place we have seen what happened in the case of Esat. Denis O'Brien has been very successful in selling his stake and can buy into another asset in which the State invested heavily in recent decades. People can buy into assets cheaply and it is amazing how devoid of sentiment they can be when they are driven by shareholders. ICC operates in a niche market and was compassionate to business people, but that could change.</P>
    <P>Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank are large consortia which buy into foreign banks, including those in London. One of our <Col N="1411" /> leading banks lost a large amount of money in London. This bank would not advance money to people in Ireland who were crying out for investment but was ready to invest money in London where it was ripped off by several people.</P>
    <P>Small is profitable and small businesses are critical to this country. ICC Bank plays an important role in the small business sector and I welcome the provision regarding equity which will allow it to invest more money. The bank has a successful track record and it is important that this niche market is serviced.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts DIRT investigation gave us an insight into what can happen. Banks were caught with their hands in the till and have had to pay millions of pounds. These banks were crucifying many people while the DIRT irregularities were taking place.</P>
    <P>We must encourage enterprise and those with business ideas. The Government talks about growing the economy and it is important that we never lose sight of small businesses. People who have nothing today will be very successful in years to come. These people need support from enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>There is great emphasis on IDA-backed companies and medium-sized companies backed by Enterprise Ireland. However, there is little or no support for companies employing fewer than ten people, bar their survival instinct. If these people do not make it they become just another casualty. It is important that they are encouraged.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's measures but I am concerned that the contractual commitment given by a prospective buyer should include a provision that it will continue to work in this niche market which ICC has developed. I would not sell ICC just for the sake of getting out of a business which has been profitable for the State. The situation would be different if ICC was a liability and the money invested by the Government was at risk. However, the State is getting a return on this money. Banks get a return on their investment and the State has obtained a massive return on its investment in ICC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate. I compliment the management and staff of ICC. The company has not always had good days but last year's report showed a profit of £23 million which is a profit for the State as the Government is the major shareholder in the bank.</P>
      <P>The last time I remember banks being discussed in the House was a sadder occasion when the Dáil had to be recalled during the summer to save AIB. If some people and the Government had done their job properly, the Government and the people would now be major shareholders in AIB as the taxpayers had to pick up the tab when the bank invested badly abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of private enterprise but I am also in favour of safety. Deputy Perry referred to the sale of an asset. We must be careful when <Col N="1412" /> selling ICC Bank because the major banks are rapidly becoming more independent and are not operating in the manner in which they were set up by the State. These banks are not operating for people but for shareholders. One might argue that this is how it should be but that is not the case. Banks should be there for their customers but that is not happening.</P>
    <P>If a widow receives her widow's pension by cheque banks will not cash it unless she has an account. The cheque must first be lodged to the account for which there is a charge and there is also a charge when the money is withdrawn. Given the behaviour of banks it is time the Government examined the position of post offices which are under the aegis of a semi-State company but the State has a major input. If the Government is talking about selling ICC Bank and its interests in other banks it will have to give powers to post offices to enable them to operate as banks. This must happen as banks are no longer prepared to provide services in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The major banks used to have offices in towns such as Foxford, Louisburgh, Newport and Achill. However, they decided they were not getting the necessary return on these services. There was a time when they would have been happy for people to use these services. If the State had not intervened, AIB would not be in business today. Now that business is going well for banks they are reducing services and it is time we gave more powers to post offices. The day will come when big brother in Europe will decide that post offices will not be able to issue social welfare payments. Such a day is not far off as Europe is suggesting post offices will not be able to offer this service under the Competition Act.</P>
    <P>I have previously spoken about the national lottery which is the greatest monopoly in this State. I have written to the Commissioner with responsibility for monopolies asking her to investigate the national lottery's monopoly. This is an abuse of power as this company which is set up, run and financed by the State will not provide services to rural Ireland. The company will provide services to cities as everything is provided for cities. However, it will not provide the service nationally.</P>
    <P>I met national lottery officials as they were concerned about comments I made in the past.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, my understanding is that one can speak about any sort of funding on Second Stage. I heard previous speakers talking about many unusual issues without interruption. The national lottery has a financial dimension. I will finish my point on the national lottery and return to the banks about which I have much to say.</P>

      <P>I have hurt the national lottery people but I did not think I was hurting you, a Cheann Comhairle. They are very upset with me but I am not finished with them yet. The national lottery will not provide a service. It has a monopoly and decides where it will locate. However, I will have an opportunity to talk about the national lottery on another day.</P>
      <P>Banks have not served the people very well. I used hear a man in Westport say, &ldquo;The one thing about the banks is they give the umbrella on the fine day and take it back on the wet day&rdquo;, and that is certainly true. One advertisement for a bank used the song &ldquo;Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me&rdquo;, but when one stops paying the banks, they get very sour quickly.</P>
      <P>No doubt the banks have mistreated many people. Deputy Perry referred to the county enterprise boards in his contribution. The ICC Bank, as bad is it was, assisted small businesses. If many young people had got a chance and had received a little help from the banks, their businesses would have been up and running many years ago. Many of them have been successful but they had to leave the State to be successful because there was no assistance available from the State and particularly from the banks.</P>
      <P>The banks would only give money to people of whom they could be sure. They never take risks, except when they go abroad. When they go abroad and take risks, they expect the taxpayers of Ireland to pick up the tab for them. That happened in the past when the Dáil had to be recalled and the taxpayers had to bail out a major financial institution. We were not quick enough at the time. The Government should have taken a 50% stake in AIB at that time and now the bank should be buying it back. The taxpayers should be rewarded for that investment but that is not happening because the bank got a free loan and was well looked after. The bank did not do that for many young business men and women who found themselves in a little difficulty. The banks were first to pull the plug and close these businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the banks depended on funding from our emigrants who went to England in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. These were people who sent home a few pounds to people's bank accounts. If this bank is to be sold, I would ask the Government to look at ways of helping our emigrants. We forgot about these people last year when we celebrated the millennium all over the State. We did not put anything in place for our emigrants, who did badly abroad but who supported this State. The records will show the amount of money which these emigrants sent back to the State on a weekly and monthly basis. These emigrants in Britain, American and elsewhere kept this country going when it was collapsing and we have forgotten about them now. <Col N="1414" /> If the ICC Bank is to be sold, I hope the Government can do something for the emigrants. I hope the Government can put something in place in this State which can help them, particularly those who have not done so well abroad.</P>
    <P>Today I received a letter from the Kerry Emigrants Support Group. That voluntary group makes the same point. I compliment the group and thank it for the wonderful work it has done over the years. They are the people who went without fuss over to England and brought back some of these people who had not done so well. If this bank is to be sold, the Government should do something, perhaps in the way of housing or care facilities, for these people who did not do so well to recognise what they have done for the State.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make a point about the post offices. I did not make this point earlier because I went off on a tangent discussing the national lottery and I had not intended to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not won the national lottery either.</P>
      <P>The day will come when the banks will become more independent. They are independent enough already because they are certainly not serving the people who have kept them in business and generated the banks' profits since their foundation. Something must be done to protect the people who are not so well off. I am talking about the elderly and pensioners, people who rarely use the banks and many of whom may not have bank accounts.</P>
      <P>I wondered in the past why elderly people put so much money under mattresses or in boxes under their beds and why there have been so many robberies of such people in the State. It is because people are no longer comfortable going into the banks because they are not treated as customers any more. The banks treat them as a number. Deputy Perry was correct &ndash; the day has nearly come when there will be a charge for going into the bank. We must do something about that. We have the opportunity now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government is selling off the ICC Bank, it must give further powers to the post offices in order that they can operate the same services as the banks. This will help the post offices to survive in rural Ireland. I ask the Minister to consider this because it is wrong that the banks are reducing the level of services in rural Ireland. If they are not prepared to take the business and provide the service, then the post offices will be delighted to do so because they are under pressure and feeling the pinch. The post offices may lose the contract for social welfare payments. This was threatened last year, although the Government negotiated in Europe to retain the <i>status quo</i>, but the day is coming when they will be told that the contract must be advertised and any European company may win it. The Government could find itself having to close more rural post <Col N="1415" /> offices. Already bank branches are closing and, as happened in the past, it is the people in rural areas who will suffer. This is a reasonable request and I hope the Government will look at it.</P>
    <P>The ICC Bank does not have a bad track record. Its staff have worked hard and have turned it around, and they must be congratulated for that. The Government should be careful when selling off this asset. If the other banks are not prepared to provide the services, perhaps the Government should look at broadening the horizons of the ICC Bank, which deals with the business community, and sending it out to compete with the other banks. If AIB Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank continue to operate in this way, we will not have much competition in the banking sector.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I must return to the subject of the national lottery on another occasion. I have a few unpleasant things to say about it but I will wait for the appropriate opportunity. I will not upset you today.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the banks that they have not been good to the people of Ireland. The taxpayers have been good to one financial institution and one good turn deserves another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their interesting contributions to the debate. I want to address a number of issues which were raised by a number of Deputies during the debate.</P>
      <P>As I said in my opening speech, I accept the concerns of the Opposition as set out by Deputy Noonan and I will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that the Minister must seek a motion of approval for a disposal of any shares. The amendment will, however, as I have said earlier, exclude the sale or transfer of shares to the employee share ownership trust from requiring a motion of approval. Legislative provision for such a transfer has already been made in the ICC Bank Act, 1999, as the Deputy will be aware, and the ESOT has been agreed with the staff.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan also asked for the strongest possible confirmation of the excellence of ICC Bank and this I am happy to give. ICC Bank has a strong record over many years of prudent lending practices and the quality and balance of its loan book is excellent.</P>
      <P>I now want to turn to Deputy McDowell's comments in which he opposed any provision being made to give the Minister power to sell his shares. I have accepted a suggestion made by Deputy Noonan that the Bill would make provision for a motion of approval by the Dáil of any proposed disposal of shares by the Minister. In fact, many Deputies who spoke in the debate supported the enabling provisions for the disposal of the bank on the basis that the Minister should have all the preparations done in advance. In all the circumstances, I do not agree with Deputy McDowell's amendment to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> A number of other issues were raised and I want to address these briefly. Several Deputies were concerned about competition in the sector when the bank is sold. Indeed, this evening Deputy Perry and others raised such matters again. I agree that the State-owned banks filled gaps in banking provision in the distant past but this is no longer the case. In competition terms, ICC Bank is a small bank and it must compete on a level playing field in both access to funds and in the provision of funds. It is not possible under the current rules applying to the Single Market to subsidise ICC Bank or to use it to subsidise borrowers.</P>
    <P>Deputies also raised the issue of competition in the area of venture capital and the potential gap the sale of ICC might leave. While ICC was a pioneer in this area, it is now one of 15 institutions active in the venture capital market which is becoming more competitive over time.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked how it was possible that ICC Bank was a listed company on the Irish Stock Exchange without its share being traded. The answer is that the State, through the Minister of Finance, owns over 99% of the issued share capital. Because there is no liquidity in these shares, there is, of course, no active market. I understand &ndash; I think Deputy McDowell and Deputy Noonan specifically asked this question &ndash; that the last share transaction occurred in 1987 between two private shareholders.</P>
    <P>Deputies also raised this issue in relation to employees being able to get value for shares appropriated through the ESOT. Shares must be held in the ESOT for a minimum period of three years for reasons of tax efficiency. The expectation is that a sale will take place well before the three years are up and that following a sale, the ESOT will swap its ICC shares for shares in the purchaser. If, however, no sale of the bank takes place in the three years after the establishment of the ESOT and shares are appropriated to employees, then any employee wanting to realise value for them could sell them on the open market. The most likely purchaser of such shares in this scenario would be the ESOT itself.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the climate for the disposal of the ICC is much better than last year. First, the market for financial shares generally is much improved with financial shares on the Irish Stock Exchange up 53% since their low point last March. Second, the uncertainty which existed last year relating to the intentions of NatWest concerning the Ulster Bank were resolved when the Royal Bank of Scotland emerged as purchaser of NatWest. Third, the financial performance of and prospects for ICC are much stronger than last year. Many Deputies referred to this and to the interim results on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister, for these reasons, has advised the board that he would be willing to consider any proposals in relation to his shareholding. The board, management and staff of the bank all agree that the change in shareholding arrangements is in the best interests of the company. I <Col N="1417" /> say to Deputy Perry, who mentioned it this evening, that the bank, its shareholders and staff are all in favour of the bank being sold. There was a number of other issues relating to specific matters to which I will return on Committee Stage. I have dealt with the main thrust of all the Deputies' points. I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 2000. The horse industry, thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred, has over the last few years continued to play a very important role and is now about to undergo significant change. This is true of many industries and is probably caused chiefly by the unprecedented growth in the Irish economy, the increase in disposable income, the radical improvements in the availability and use of leis<Col N="1418" /> ure time in people's lives, coupled with the modernisation of life styles.</P>
    <P>All of this change created great opportunities for businesses in the service, leisure and tourism sectors. This is where the breeding, training and racing of horses and greyhounds are most active and progress and prosperity in these areas all have significant benefits for the producers of the basic products, that is, good quality horses and greyhounds. We have three State bodies playing leading and very important roles in these sectors &ndash; the National Stud, the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon. All three have, through the efforts of very commercially minded and business orientated chairmen and boards, not only seized the opportunities that were there but with vision pushed these sectors beyond all apparent barriers to place them at the cutting edge for the future.</P>
    <P>This Government has shown strong commitment to these sectors by the provision of an appropriate and much increased level of investment funding for the State bodies concerned. However, that was not all. Very critically at important stages over the last few years my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and myself, have prompted much needed change in the underlying organisational and financial structures underpinning these sectors.</P>
    <P>In this process, I have also paid great attention to detail in terms of providing the essential legislative framework by introducing the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994, which provided for the establishment of the Irish Horseracing Authority, the State Property Act, 1998, relating to the power to sell part of the National Stud Farm and the Irish Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Act, 1999, which re-structured the way in which the IHA was part financed. Today, I am introducing the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and I intend to introduce, in the very near future, legislation &ndash; probably the most significant ever in this area &ndash; governing the final phase of the restructuring of the way in which the horseracing industry is organised and funded, giving it a secure and permanent footing for the long-term future.</P>
    <P>I would like to concentrate on the radical changes which the horseracing industry has undergone in recent years and the even more fundamental changes which I have indicated are to come. There is no doubt that the establishment of the IHA and the work it has done since 1994 was a major step in the development of the horseracing industry in line with the aspirations of many involved in the sector. The result is there for all to see &ndash; increased prize money, better facilities at our racecourses and improved customer services resulting in strong growth in the key economic indicators of the health of the business. Attendance levels &ndash; 1.3 million in horseracing and 700,000 in greyhound racing &ndash; in recent years are an indication of the good state of health of both industries. Attendance numbers have <Col N="1419" /> increased substantially. Betting has also increased substantially and this year it is estimated that close to £1 billion will be bet off-course and £125 million on course in both industries.</P>
    <P>Much of this positive development has come about due to the IHA and its development plan, spearheaded by its chairman, Denis Brosnan. Further and continued development is possible in both these industries.</P>
    <P>We are now at another milestone in the history of Irish racing and we have a unique opportunity to take the final leap that will provide a secure and permanent organisational structure and funding to allow Irish racing develop to its full potential and will satisfy the needs of a rapidly changing industry for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, I am talking about the establishment of a new unified structure under a body to be called Horse Racing Ireland or HRI to replace the IHA and take over certain functions from the Turf Club. It is planned that this will facilitate securing for Irish racing the revenue coming from the tax on off-course betting which currently goes to the Exchequer. Since the announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in December 1999 of his willingness to consider such a major concession the road has been long and difficult to say the least. Consultations were extensive and negotiations went through difficult periods. That is what one would expect when the level of change being proposed is so great. However, the importance of the proposals for the future of the industry and all those depending on it for their livelihood was accepted by all and I am glad to be able to record here the success of the agreement reached recently with all parties.</P>
    <P>I am now making arrangements for the drafting of the heads of the Bill and the necessary legislation will be put to Government in the near future. I am looking forward to publishing a Bill on the subject early next year. I am confident that not just are we doing the right thing, but we are now making a most profound change for the future of Irish racing.</P>
    <P>This legislation deals with the immediate requirements of the National Stud. One aspect more than anything else which has stood to those in the horseracing industry is the ability to breed and train excellent world class racehorses. It is gratifying for me and all Irish people concerned with the horse industry to observe the international standing of the Irish bloodstock breeding and racing industry. For a small nation, the level of achievement is immense. The internationally recognised quality of Irish bloodstock and the renown of our horsemen and horsewomen lead to a natural sense of pride.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is my view that the Irish National Stud is once again at the forefront of the Irish horse industry. On that basis, I am pleased to bring this Bill before the House which will allow the National Stud to develop even further. It is a tremendous national asset from the view<Col N="1420" /> point of the contribution it makes to horse breeding and the efforts of Irish breeders generally, the international reputation it helps to create and sustain and the consequential benefits it creates for the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in the context of the proposed Bill to reflect on some of the history and character of the National Stud. As I said previously in the presence of Deputy Dukes, the stud was bequeathed to the nation in the same year as myself. The Deputy hoped that Kildare got the better bargain. Of course, I disagreed with that analysis. During the past 100 years, since its inception as a stud, Tully has been the nursery of so many world famous racehorses that its name is almost a household word, synonymous with all that is best in the thoroughbred. Many people will recall Lord Gayle, Crash Course, Sallust, Ahonoora and many more outstanding international thoroughbreds. For 2001 the Irish National Stud will have five stallions standing in Tully, including Indian Ridge, one of the top proven stallions in Europe and sire of Namid, the top rated sprinter in Europe this year. The other stallions are world champion three year old of 1998, Desert Prince, champion French miler, Ashkalani and Priolo, sire of the champion miler, Sendawar, and joining them, the soon to be retired, Indian Danehill, a group one winner in France. Desert Prince spends some of his time standing in Australia in order to maximise income from a valuable resource.</P>
    <P>In addition to the stallions standing at the company's farms in Kildare are four national hunt stallions based around the country, including the proven sire, Broken Hearted, and the new addition, Rudimentary, who is owned by the stud in partnership with Anngrove Stud. This makes the stud's stallions more easily accessible to breeders throughout the country while again maximising revenues and keeping the stud's interest in partnership arrangements which are the order of the day now in the bloodstock sector.</P>
    <P>The stud company is currently trading very well with profits of in excess of £400,000 in 1998, in excess of £600,000 in 1999 and another predicted substantial profit in 2000. It is interesting to note that the total turnover generated from the company's stallions this year is more than £6 million, of which well in excess of £3.5 million is generated from foreign owned mares, such is the world class attractiveness of the Irish National Stud's stallions. For the future it is the intention of the stud to continue to invest in international quality stallions and mares. This is the core business of the company, which it has done very successfully for some years. On the stud's yearlings, this year turnover was almost £1 million at the recent yearling sales at Goffs and included the top priced filly sold in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The year 2000 was a record year for tourism at the stud, the Japanese Gardens and Saint Fiachra's Garden, the appropriate millennium project, which opened in June 1999. It is expected that final numbers of visitors will be in excess of <Col N="1421" /> 145,000, some 17,000 more than last year and almost 50% higher than the figures about which we were talking when debating the State Property Bill just two years ago. The company is currently investigating the feasibility of building a new museum of the horse which, I hope, will be completed during the coming three years. Another aspect of the Irish National Stud's function for some years is its annual training course in horse breeding, of which it is justifiably proud. This most important course will be continued in the future as it is regarded one of the best training courses in the world and has a track record second to none.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill gives the House an ideal opportunity to look back over the earlier legislation on the National Stud. The National Stud Act, 1945, vested the National Stud Farm in County Kildare in the Minister for Agriculture. It provided for the establishment by the Minister of a limited company under the Companies Acts to operate the stud farm and for the Minister to grant a licence to the stud company and to use the land accordingly. It provided also for associated matters such as the share capital and borrowing limits of the company.</P>
    <P>The National Stud Act, 1976, amended the 1945 Act by, among other things, increasing the share capital to £5 million and the borrowing powers of the company to £500,000. The 1993 amendment Act increased the share capital from £5 million to £10 million and the borrowing powers from £500,000 to £5 million. The National Stud, through organisational restructuring, particularly strong leadership at chairman level and the development of a process of strategic planning in its administration combined with State investment has, over the last few years, become a profitable State body.</P>
    <P>I wish to record my appreciation of the very good leadership shown by David Shubotham during his term as chairman and the current chairman, Mrs. Chryss O'Reilly, who have done a remarkable job for the Irish National Stud in the last few years and Mr. John Clarke, the current general manager of the stud. Since 1996 profits have exceeded £2 million. It is, however, in the context of today's requirements in the bloodstock sector restricted in its commercial operations by the current limits on share capital and borrowing and the status of its licence to use the stud lands. The Bill proposes to address these issues and deal with some other minor matters largely of a technical and legal nature.</P>
    <P>The total amount of share capital that can be issued in respect of the national stud is currently limited to £10 million. To date, the State has purchased £9,975,374 of the available share capital, leaving a total of unissued shares remaining at only £24,626. The equity investment of recent years has all been channelled into the purchase of top quality stallions or shares in such stallions. It is, among other initiatives, the acquisition of these stallions which has underpinned the success of the stud and brought the company back from <Col N="1422" /> a loss-making position in the early 1990s to a viable and profit-making operation today. The stud will have to continue to purchase shares in more quality stallions over the coming years. For that reason it is proposed to increase the share capital of the company from £10 million to £25 million.</P>
    <P>The National Stud's borrowing powers are currently limited to £5 million and such borrowing is subject to the approval of both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Finance. The price of top quality stallions in which the National Stud would be interested has increased substantially in recent years. When the stud becomes interested in a particular stallion it is crucial in competing in a tough market place and to achieve purchase at the most reasonable price available that the stud is able to move quickly in offering a price and completing a purchase. On some occasions also the stud will want to purchase 100% of the shares of a stallion and then seek investors to take up a proportion of those. Both of these manoeuvres would generally require substantial short-term borrowing. It is proposed to increase the borrowing limit of £5 million to £20 million, also to allow the stud's subsidiaries/joint ventures to borrow subject to the overall limit of £20 million and to provide that all such borrowings will remain subject to the consent of the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance.</P>
    <P>The National Stud currently holds the stud lands under licence from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It is proposed to give the Minister the power to vest all or any part of the lands in the company, to make it possible for the company itself to purchase and sell land, subject to the consent of the Minister. This is particularly relevant now because of the Kildare by-pass, which will result in the separation of parts of the stud lands from the main farm, making those parts considerably less suitable for stud farming. The stud needs to be able to dispose of land which is no longer suitable for stud farming and to purchase suitable lands as and when the opportunity and need arises. This is provided for in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have included also in section 2 safeguards in relation to funds generated from such sales so that the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance of the day can determine the uses to which such proceeds can be put. If the revenues are relatively small or reasonably in proportion to the stud's needs generally the Ministers may allow the stud to decide how the funds may be used in its best commercial interests. If there are particular purposes or projects relating to the stud which the Ministers deem require to be funded from the sales of land, they may direct that to be the case. If, on the other hand, re-zoning of the lands for instance involve the generation of funds significantly above the ordinary commercial needs of the stud company, the Minister can require that the surplus involved would be paid to the Exchequer. This flexibility will best serve the <Col N="1423" /> needs of the stud farm, the company and the State.</P>
    <P>Under current legislation, the National Stud does not have the power to form subsidiary companies. The stud is now involved in what is effectively a separate business relating to its tourism activities and does from time to time operate its search for and purchase of bloodstock separately from its main stud farm operations. These businesses can be most efficiently operated from a VAT viewpoint, in particular through subsidiary companies. It is now proposed to allow the stud to establish such companies and also purchase shares in other companies and to enter into joint ventures, subject to ministerial consent, which is in line with powers recently introduced for the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon.</P>
    <P>Under the 1945 Act each director of the Irish National Stud Company holds one share in the company. Five shares are held by ministerial nominees who are civil servants in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance with some responsibility or expertise in this area. The remaining shares are held by the Minister for Finance. To date 9,975,374 shares have issued, of which the Minister for Finance holds 9,975,362. Under the present arrangement new share certificates must issue and other documentation has to be amended every time there are changes to the board of directors or if any of the other shareholders retire or die. It is proposed to amend the Act to allow us to dispense with these procedures and to provide for the total share allocation to be held by the Minister for Finance and, if required, certain office holders in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a number of other technical changes of minor consequence, dealing with the name of the company and its objectives which clarify the totality of the role and activities of the stud as it has evolved down the years.</P>
    <P>There is no direct charge on the Exchequer in these proposals. However, if and when the Minister for Finance opts to purchase some of the additional shares in the National Stud provided for in this Bill there will of course then be financial implications for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve the general objective of this Bill which is, broadly speaking, to give the Irish National Stud Company the necessary freedom and flexibility to carry on its business in a commercial manner and to build on its strengths and successes to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always had a very special regard for this company. Apart from the fact that I live less than a mile from its very well managed lands, it gave me a very welcome morale boost at a very difficult time in the early 1980s. It was the first semi-State company that sent me, as Minister for Finance, a dividend cheque. In those days that <Col N="1424" /> was a rare event and I am delighted the Irish National Stud Company has the distinction of being the first semi-State company to do so. I am delighted a few other semi-State companies have found themselves in similar positions since. I am also delighted some previously semi-State companies are now paying dividends to private investors.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Stud Company has gone from strength to strength. I join the Minister in congratulating the various people who have been involved in that, particularly in the last 20 years. In that period the company has had, and continues to have outstanding management. One of the former managers of the Irish National Stud Company has gone on to gain a position of considerable renown in the thoroughbred industry throughout the world. I am delighted to say the current manager seems set to stay where he is for some time and is doing an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Although it is probably not fashionable to do so in these days of political correctness, I am always ready to commend and recommend the role of various chairmen and members of the board of the company, of all descriptions and stripes, who have given extremely good service over the years and to whom the State should be grateful. The members of State boards, who sometimes find themselves up to their ears in controversy, fulfil their duties for a very little consideration. Often, there is very little honour or glory to be gained either. On occasions when we can recognise and commend the role they play, we should do so.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Irish National Stud have always rowed in with the objective of the development of the company. I know the company very well and I know it to be a very happy ship. I have even seen the <i>Pirates of Penzance</i> performed on the lake in the stud, on a very cold June evening.</P>
    <P>The company has never been afraid of innovation in various fields and has, as a result, a very high reputation at home and abroad. It has a consistent policy of keeping very good stallions across the fee range. It is also involved in national hunt stallions. This is appropriate because there is more than one dimension to our racing industry. The result is that the Irish National Stud has built up a very wide appeal in the horse breeding community at home and abroad. In the last three years profits have averaged £600,000 per annum and there are prospects of a substantial profit again this year.</P>
    <P>The company both buys and sells stallions and I am sure the Minister will agree that the company has always bought and sold very well. It has done well on both its purchases and sales and there have been some cases when its timing has been extremely good, in view of market conditions. Next year there will be five stallions at the stud. They all have enviable reputations and extremely good progeny has resulted. This year the company achieved the top price of £650,000 for a filly sold in Ireland. All of this indicates that <Col N="1425" /> the company is doing its core business extremely well.</P>
    <P>The company has turned itself into a centre of excellence in breeding education. It has a thoroughbred breeding course that is fully integrated into the operation at Tully. The course is oversubscribed. There is great demand for places among young people who wish to make a career in thoroughbred breeding and they come to Tully from all over the world. It is wonderful to see that such an operation can be successful and achieve such a high reputation. The stud has been part of a wider development of Kildare as a centre of education in the equine industry. One of the National Stud's closest neighbours is the racing academy and centre of education, which was started by a group of individuals with a vision to train young people for the racing industry. It has achieved a number of remarkable successes and already includes at least one champion jockey among its former pupils.</P>
    <P>The stud has also developed a very successful tourist attraction, based originally around the old and famous Japanese Garden and now includes Saint Fiachra's Garden, linking with a long tradition of monasticism. This year the stud will have welcomed around 150,000 paying visitors. It is a very important amenity in the town of Kildare and its hinterland and is going from strength to strength. It also has a garden centre which has developed a reputation for breeding miniature bonsai trees.</P>
    <P>In the light of these successes, it makes very good sense to give the company the flexibility it requires to continue to build on the various aspects of its business. For that reason I support the provision in section 2 of the Bill that the Minister &ldquo;may, by order and without any conveyance, transfer or assignment vest all or part of the National Stud Farm in the company&rdquo;. I urge the Minister to do that as quickly as he can.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot understand why the Minister feels it necessary to attach the qualifications set out in subsection 2(3). It is provided there that the proceeds of sale by the company of any land vested in it may be used by the company, not only to achieve its principal objects or to do anything that the company considers to be connected or incidental to those objects, but may be used for purposes or projects specified by the Minister to the benefit of the company or may, on the instruction of the Minster, be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer. I wondered why the Minister felt he had to put such a spancel on the company as he explained it earlier. In an effort to understand it, I will outline it in the following way and I invite the Minister to say if he agrees with me.</P>
    <P>He said that if there is not much money involved, the company can do what it wishes with it. However, the Minister was being careful when he said that if there are particular purposes or projects relating to the stud which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Finance deem require to be <Col N="1426" /> funded from the sales of land, then they may direct that that may be the case. The company can do whatever it wishes as long as the Ministers agree.</P>
    <P>He also said that if, on the other hand, rezoning of the lands, for instance, involves the generation of funds significantly above the ordinary commercial needs of the stud company, the Minister can require that the surplus involved will be paid back to the Exchequer. The Minister then added entirely gratuitously that this flexibility will best serve the needs of the stud farm, the company and the State.</P>
    <P>The company can have flexibility as long as there is not much money involved. However, if there are funds significantly above the ordinary commercial needs of the company involved, it will have no flexibility. The matter must go to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Finance for their agreement. This is not a theoretical issue because the Minister deliberately included this provision.</P>
    <P>The construction of the Kildare town by-pass is, at long last, about to begin. This will alter not only the geography of Kildare town and its hinterland, but also the economic geography of the area. It will also do some other things and the Minister knows it. It will be a substantial impetus to development in the general area of Kildare town. It is already partly becoming a commuter town and there will be more development.</P>
    <P>As development takes place around a place such as a stud farm, it becomes difficult for it to co-exist with development in its general area. The Minister obviously foresaw this and if the National Stud takes advantage of a&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;lift in the market and cashes in on it, the Minister wants the privilege of second guessing what the company does with the money. However, if that happens, the Irish National Stud Company will be similar to many other landowners who live in the vicinity of major motorway projects in that it will have to compete for land elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The price of land elsewhere will not remain static and the Minister knows this. Unfortunately for him, and I agree with his regret, it does not apply in his constituency because the Government does not do things from the western or southern parts, although I have urged it to do so for years. However, this will be a common problem in the rest of the country in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are displaced for whatever reason by major economic or social infrastructural development will have to compete for a limited amount of land elsewhere. They will have to pay considerably more for the new land, if they can acquire any, than they paid for what they hold. If they realise a substantial gain on what they sold, as the Minister envisages the National Stud may <Col N="1427" /> do, they will need a substantial part of it to reinvest.</P>
    <P>If the day arrives when the National Stud must move a substantial part of its operation from Tully to elsewhere in County Kildare, it will not only have to acquire land but also put in place the type of infrastructure required on a stud farm. It will have to create new yards and roadways and it may have to invest in a new building for the education enterprises in which it is involved. The provision in the Bill will create unnecessary complications which will have to be addressed by a future Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and a future Minister for Finance with a future board of the Irish National Stud Company.</P>
    <P>This is an unnecessary restriction on its power and I look forward to tabling an amendment to it on Committee Stage. I hope, when he reflects on the matter, that the Minister will agree and remove this unnecessary restriction from the Bill. The company has a solid record. If it makes a decision for what it considers to be good business reasons, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Finance should allow it to get on with the job. They should not try to second guess a company which, the Minister agrees, has a very good track record and has performed extremely well.</P>
    <P>That provision contrasts sharply with the provisions in the Bill of which I approve to increase the share capital and borrowing limits of the company. Those provisions are entirely justified and well founded and I approve of them without qualification. I also approve of the provision in section 7 which will allow the company to establish subsidiary companies, the provision in section 8 which will allow the company to acquire shares in other companies and the provision in section 9 which will allow the company to enter joint ventures with other companies. These measures are entirely appropriate.</P>
    <P>The provision that allows the company to establish subsidiaries will put it in a position to acquire bloodstock in the UK without the need to pay VAT at 17.5%. It is important to do whatever we can to put the company into a better position to compete effectively in what is, I am sure the Minister will agree, an already very competitive market for bloodstock.</P>
    <P>The National Stud is an important player in our valuable bloodstock industry. It caters for the needs of breeders across the spectrum. In this connection, I ask the Minister to reflect on the point that part of the stud's business which is accounted for by the smaller breeder will be affected by the inequitable nature of the current foal levy. This levy is graded but, in its current form, it is extremely crude and unfair to the smaller breeder.</P>
    <P>For example, if a breeder pays £750 for a nomination, the foal levy payable is £25. If a breeder pays ten times that amount, £7,500, for a nomination, the foal levy will be only six times the <Col N="1428" /> amount the smaller breeder must pay. The grading in the foal levy system is wrong. It is excessively weighted against the smaller breeder. The Minister knows this and I am sure he has received as many representations as I and other Members on the issue. There is a strong sense of grievance among smaller breeders, but, so far, the Minister appears to have ignored it.</P>
    <P>These grievances have been communicated to me in specific terms and other Members have heard the same. The experience of Members is that these grievances have been brought to us anonymously. There appears to be a fear among smaller breeders that if they make their case in public and their names are associated with it, they might find it difficult to get access to nominations to stallions that they want. I do not know if there is any basis for this fear, but if those small breeders wish to speak to me about the matter, I will guarantee them anonymity. I am sure all other Members of the House would also give them that guarantee. I remind the Minister that this grievance exists and that this is a good time to resolve it given that, as he said, other things are happening in the breeding and racing industry which we hope will improve the situation for the future. It is time to recast the levy and make it more equitable.</P>
    <P>Like all those with an interest in the thoroughbred breeding business, I am pleased that agreement has been reached among all the interests in the racing sector on its future governance. However, two racing correspondents, for reasons best known to themselves, have chosen rather maliciously to misinterpret Fine Gael's position on the issue. Their actions are curious&mdash;</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the injustice done to the people involved, as recognised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, calls on the Government to provide either an appropriate milk quota or financial compensation to each of the members of the Milk Rights Group, based on the outcome of the successful legal proceedings taken by persons in the same situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in Fine Gael, move this motion to remedy a long-standing injustice. Our view of this matter has the backing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is based on decisions made by the courts in over 100 specific cases of people who are in situations similar, if not identical, to those in which members of the Milk Rights Group now find themselves.</P>
      <P>The roots of this injustice go back to the early 1980s. Given the views subsequently taken by the courts and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the time has come for the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to take appropriate action to remedy that injustice. It has often been said that justice delayed is justice denied. On that basis, the members of the Milk Rights Group have been denied justice for far too long, and any further delay will only increase that injustice.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment, which I hope he will decide not to move, asks the House to accept that the position taken by the Minister up to now is the appropriate one in the circumstances. It flies in the face of what courts have decided and an Oireachtas committee has supported. The Minister is effectively inviting Members of this House, particularly members of his party who support the committee's view, to deny themselves and to reverse the position they took when they accepted the case made by the Milk Rights Group. The amendment invites Members of this House, knowingly and wilfully, to prolong and maintain an injustice. It invites Deputy Healy-Rae, who is a paid up member of the Milk Rights Group, to turn his back on an organisation to which he freely adhered, to apostatize himself and to give the back of his hand to people who up to now regarded him as a friend and ally.</P>
      <P>Neither the Government nor the Minister has claimed the courts got it wrong. They have, however, adopted the much more craven and dishonourable stance of sheltering behind the Statute of Limitations. They do not argue with the courts or say the courts were wrong to do what they did. They say that too much time has now passed for them to believe they are in any way obliged to act to redress this injustice. That stance by the Government may be legal in the strictest sense of the word but it is not honest, realistic, fair or compassionate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael invite the Minister to take an <i>ex gratia</i> action to remedy an injustice with which he has been familiar for many years. His only response is a pathetic amendment which invites members of his party to make liars of themselves and to turn their backs on their decent instincts and invites us to believe that the Minister is to be <Col N="1430" /> totally trusted in his handling of all aspects of the milk quota regime.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that the issue taken up by the Milk Rights Group is not the only issue of difficulty with the milk quota regime. He must know by now that the most recent milk restructuring scheme has left many farmers, including a number in his constituency, with a strong sense of grievance. He must know that the operation of the milk quota system has been and will continue to be controversial in many respects. It is a piece of brazen political effrontery by the Minister to invite the House to state that it supports him in his handling of all aspects of the milk quota regime.</P>
    <P>The problem raised by the Milk Rights Group goes back to the beginning of the milk quota system. I have always been against such systems. I know that is not a common view in public among the leaders and spokespersons of the main farming organisations. Quota systems unnecessarily freeze production patterns and they restrict as many people as they help, if not more. We have enough evidence of that in the European Union's farming system today. There is now almost nothing one can do on a farm without getting permission to do it. One must have a quota to produce milk, to run a suckler herd, to keep ewes and to grow corn. One must now get and pay for a licence to keep livestock since the Minister reneged on a commitment given by the Minister of State. We now have a more regulated system of agriculture than was ever seen in the old Soviet Union and we are not the better of it.</P>
    <P>In a previous employment I was partly instrumental in delaying the introduction of the milk quota system by a few years. I had hoped to be instrumental in preventing its emergence but, unfortunately, that was not to be. For good or ill, the system was introduced in 1983. At the time the quota system was instituted, a number of farmers in member states of the European Community, as it was then, had farm development plans which included a dairy enterprise as an essential part of ensuring the viability of their farms. Many Members of the House will remember what it was like in those days to work out development and viability plans. They were not taken lightly by anyone. Numbers of farmers whose plans included a dairy enterprise had the misfortune at the time to have recently had an animal disease problem which meant they were not engaged in milk production at the relevant times when entitlements to milk quota were being considered. They were not the only ones who had a grievance.</P>
    <P>Any quota system, no matter how fairly its architects try to construct it, is of necessity arbitrary and restrictive and will fail to provide for the legitimate aspirations of many of those affected by it. In the specific case of the milk quota regime, its design was inherently susceptible to influence and interference by the type of animal health problems which unfortunately emerged even on the best run farms. Thus, a <Col N="1431" /> number of people who had a legitimate expectation and a pressing need to have a dairy enterprise were excluded from the milk quota system.</P>
    <P>That is where the injustice began which our motion seeks to remedy. Many of the people affected by being denied milk quota at the beginning went on to develop a dairy enterprise by leasing or buying quota over the years. Anyone who knows the operation of the quota system will realise that no matter how hard those people tried, they were inevitably adversely affected by the fact that they did not have a milk quota of their own to build on as a base from which to develop. That has been an obstacle with which those people have had to contend for the greater part of the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>The matter ended up before the courts, first in the Mulder case and subsequently in many other cases. That went on for a long time. The Minister and Deputies on this side of the House know how long those procedures took. The cases all had one thing in common. The courts vindicated the rights of the applicants and found that they were entitled to the same consideration that had been given to other people involved in milk production but who did not have disease problems at the material time. In the case of the problem focused on by the Milk Rights Group, over 100 people brought their cases before the courts and found their rights were vindicated. They were entitled to be compensated for the fact that they had been excluded in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Not all the details of these cases have been settled. I understand that further detailed action still has to be worked out in individual cases to give effect to what the courts have decided. Many of the people affected by this injustice found themselves unable to take the risk of committing potentially large amounts of finance to the hazards of the courts. Who can blame them? We know from many connections that not everybody can afford to take a case before a court. Inevitably proceedings last for some time and in some of these cases they were very protracted.</P>
    <P>The result of what has happened is that there is a substantial number of people who have basically the same grievance as those who could afford to go before the courts, who see their rights have been vindicated. They therefore have a legitimate expectation that in comparable cases they should receive comparable treatment and redress for the injustices they have suffered. That lies at the core of the motion.</P>
    <P>The motion does not seek to impose a specific formula of address in each case. It calls on the Government to provide either an appropriate milk quota or financial compensation to each of the members of the Milk Rights Group based on the outcome of the successful legal proceedings taken by persons in the same situation. It is specifically designed to leave those affected by this injustice &ndash; and the Minister &ndash; a substantial <Col N="1432" /> latitude as to how to find the remedy for each individual case.</P>
    <P>While the problems are common, the situations of individual affected have evolved differently over the years. Personal, family and farming circumstances have changed in different ways for different people. That is why we propose a solution that leaves latitude to both parties to find the most appropriate remedy in each case. The Minister appears to have the latitude to deal with the situation in cases where it seems that a quota allocation is the right way to proceed. When responding to the motion I invite him to say how much latitude he has.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to take a constructive view of the motion. Let us have, for once, a Minister responding to a motion with a solution to the problem. He should not tell us what he considers to be the problems in the motion because we have deliberately left it wide to allow him and the parties with a grievance the flexibility to find ways to resolve specific cases.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the members of the Milk Rights Group who have fought their case with energy and persistence over the years, through many vicissitudes and in the face of considerable personal difficulties. The have made a deep and lasting impression on Members to whom they have spoken. It was they, and their energies, who helped my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, who preceded me as Agriculture spokesperson for my party, when he brought the matter before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The committee approached the issue with its usual application and understanding and, after due deliberation, unambiguously concluded that the Milk Rights Group had made a case deserving of its support. Accordingly, it unanimously recommended that provision be made for compensation for the members of the Milk Rights Group.</P>
    <P>The committee was, rightly, careful not to be specific about the form of the compensation because it saw the matter in the same way as I did. Members of all parties in the committee supported its conclusion, including the Chairman, Deputy John Browne from the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, Government backbenchers from the Dáil and the Seanad and Deputies and Senators from the Labour Party and Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Since then, nothing has happened that should cause any of the committee's members to change their view and there is nothing in the Minister's proposed amendment to the motion that could lead any member of the committee to change his or her view. Nor is there anything in the amendment that could lead any Member of the House who is not a member of the committee to change his or her stated view, whether that Member be a Government backbencher, a member of the Opposition or one of the so-called Independent Members who have slavishly supported the Government in every nonsense it has perpetrated.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister will persist with his pathetic amendment to the motion, but I hope <Col N="1433" /> he does not. He would do a great favour to a great many people if he accepts our case. There would not be much triumphalism at that, rather many people would consider the best way to approach a resolution of their difficulties. I would like to see the energy represented by the people who supported the Milk Rights Group being devoted to that kind of constructive work rather than being spent on trying to persuade the Minister to do the decent and inevitable thing by supporting the motion and accepting the conclusion of a committee of this House.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to stop hiding behind the Statute of Limitations and to stop ignoring the fact that courts have decided that people who have been treated in the same way as the members of the Milk Rights Group are entitled to redress. He should stop trying to deny the existence of the problem by attempting to sweep it under the carpet. Let us find a way to deal with this problem. It is not the only problem to have emerged from the milk quota system.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposed amendment to the motion is the flimsiest of figleafs. I reject it. I ask the House to do so, but to save us that trouble I ask the Minister to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is present to hear some common sense in so far as it relates to the farmers concerned with this motion. In 1997, in the case of Duff <i>v.</i> the Minister for Agriculture, the Supreme Court finally determined that the Minister had made a legal mistake in the method used to allocate milk quota and that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages. That was a clear legal position. However, because the members of the Milk Rights Group were not among the plaintiffs in that case, the Department has refused to compensate them for losses and damages suffered and has adopted the position that their claims are &ldquo;statute-barred&rdquo;. This famous double-barreled word does not make a tráithnín of sense as far as the members of the Milk Rights Group are concerned.</P>
      <P>Having carefully considered the facts, I maintain that the members of the group who are currently engaged in farming and who can demonstrate that they, like the plaintiffs in the Duff case, suffered loss or damage as a consequence of the mistake of law made by the Minister, are morally entitled to compensation for past and future losses or damages. This compensation should be awarded on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis and the Department should not shirk its moral responsibilities by sheltering behind the statute-barred defence. Members of the group should not be further penalised because they did not have the necessary financial resources to pursue the State through the courts or were unwilling to incur further financial losses by so doing. The Minister knows in his heart that the majority of the farmers concerned were not in a financial position to go to court to prove their rights in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> The Department should now assist those currently engaged in farming to obtain compensation. This could be achieved through an examination of the Department's files and-or newspaper advertisements. The Milk Rights Group has already undertaken such an exercise and has estimated the numbers affected. The group could greatly assist the Department by providing it with this information and other documentation such as farm development plans and cattle disease facts.</P>
    <P>The Department has a number of options available to it. It can allocate all currently unallocated 11.5 million gallons of milk quota to farmers represented by the group still in production and who can demonstrate they suffered loss or damage. If this is the Minister's preferred option, he should immediately ring-fence that quota until precise quota allocations are calculated. The figures compiled by the Milk Rights Group indicate that this would involve an allocation in excess of eight million gallons. I understand the IFA has negotiated, or is in the process of negotiating, a deal with the Minister for six million gallons of quota. If that is the case, he should accept our motion in good faith. If the Minister is unwilling to pursue the above course of action, he should compensate affected farmers for past and future losses through the provision of a monetary award or combine the above options. As the Department is responsible for the original error, it is a matter for it, in consultation with the damaged parties, to decide which of these options is most appropriate.  </P>
    <P>The current difficulties arise from a legal error made by departmental officials under a previous Government but the resolution lies in the Minister's hand. There is the strongest conceivable moral obligation on the Minister and the Department to devise an appropriate remedy.</P>
    <P>The quota year was based on the farm production of milk for the year 1982-3 and the quota was established on the basis of the amount of milk supplied by each farmer during that year. No concessions were made for farmers who experienced disease problems in their herds that year and who strictly complied with the rules governing diseased herds at the time. I know of a farmer in the Minister's constituency who had a herd of 75 milk cows in the period 1980-81 but lost 25 of them as a result of bovine tuberculosis. How could that farmer have been expected to reach his target for the quota year 1982-83 when he lost 25 animals in spite of having diligently complied with the Department's instructions? </P>
    <P>The Minister should come out from the shadows and accede to the request before him. It would not break his heart to make a settlement in this very important matter. As many of the people concerned are in the Minister's constituency, it would be to his benefit to accede to this request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is past time that the issue of the milk quota was debated and voted on in <Col N="1435" /> this House. I do not have the necessary time to go over the painful history of so many potentially viable dairy farmers, many of whom I have known personally, from 1983 onwards. Many of the farmers who had high hopes in the early 1980s have left farming in a bitter and confused state and I am sure some of them are here this evening. The debacle placed others under such a severe financial burden that they have been discriminated against repeatedly over the years.</P>
      <P>No group in Irish society has such a compelling entitlement to compensation as the Milk Rights Group. Legal precedents have been set both here and in Europe. The famous Mulder case made EU history some years ago when a Dutch court found in favour of a Dutch dairy farmer. The Irish court system has granted compensation to a group of farmers which fought its way through a maze of court proceedings, some of which are still ongoing.</P>
      <P>The only defence advanced by this Government in regard to the Milk Rights Group is that its case is statute-barred. The Minister does not contest the fact that these farmers and their families were hurt, and in some cases ruined, by this debacle. I have never heard him publicly state that there is any difference between this group and the first one. Yet, he hides behind the legal definition of statute-barred. Two groups of dairy farmers wished to make a living from the land; the courts found in favour of one of them but the second group did not have the necessary financial wherewithal to go to court. When a farmer loses dairy cows and, therefore, his or her plans are ruined, he or she is not really in a position to pursue a legal case against the State. Many of the farmers here tonight, and others who are not present, did not have any alternative but to stand back in the absence of the financial backing required to go to court.</P>
      <P>Precedents have been set in regard to this matter. Everyone agreed that the first group had a case and the case was also made in Europe. Significant numbers of Irish farmers, who are members of this group, are entitled to be compensated in some way. I have met hundreds of these farmers over the years. They are not necessarily seeking everything to which they might be entitled but they are seeking a fair settlement.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister and all the members of the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine state that these farmers have a genuine case. We come to the Minister on their behalf. They are entitled to be looked after.</P>
      <P>In terms of the amendment, we have been listening to that long playing record for years. It is about time it was changed and the Minister came up with an equitable system which will financially help farmers who have spent almost 20 years trying to get their rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The injustice visited upon those farmers who participated in the farm modernisation scheme, who found the legs cut from under <Col N="1436" /> them in terms of establishing a milk quota, dates back almost 20 years. To borrow a phrase from another area of political debate, those who had that injustice inflicted upon them have not gone away. The fact that they have been campaigning for justice for almost 20 years is a clear indication of their belief that a serious injustice has been inflicted upon them.</P>
      <P>Neither an official in the Department or a Minister deliberately inflicted that injustice on them, but what is at issue is whether the Minister, now in a unique position because of milk and money availability, will deliberately withhold justice from the group. That is the essence of what we are debating tonight. None of the Minister's predecessors were in his unique position in terms of Exchequer buoyancy beyond our wildest dreams, to provide financial compensation and an additional 11 million gallons of quota. These could be combined to provide a compensation package for farmers.</P>
      <P>Either the stamp of agencies of the State &ndash; Teagasc, or ACOT in the early 1980s &ndash; and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development mean something or they mean nothing. It would be a calamity if these farmers, who were enticed, invited and encouraged to undertake development programmes on their farms, now found, when a unique opportunity exists to resolve their dilemma, that we closed the door on them on the basis that they are statute-barred.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year we had a debacle in terms of concerned quota holders, many of them in the Minister's constituency and substantial numbers in County Cork, and changes to the milk quota regime. Farmers were extremely aggrieved about changes introduced. The milk quota regime is a minefield, because it is very difficult not to disadvantage some by moving in one direction. However, in this case there is a clear-cut opportunity, given that 11 million gallons are available to the Minister from CAP reform and the Exchequer buoyancy, to introduce a package to give justice to these people after 20 years. It is past time that this matter was brought to a financial and satisfactory conclusion. That they have persisted in campaigning for so long is indicative of the injustice they believe was done to them.</P>
      <P>Not every injustice has a legal remedy, but in today's climate people should have access to a political solution, and the Minister is in a unique position to deliver that, unlike his predecessors. So that we can bring finality to this issue I urge the Minister to accept the motion as tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Independent Deputies will vote on this motion tomorrow night if the Minister does not accept it. One cannot say one thing on the plinth of Leinster House and do the exact opposite in this House. They are either Independent Deputies in the true meaning of the term &lsquo;independent', who will weigh up every issue in terms of justice, or they are in effect Fianna Fáil by another name. I particularly call on Deputy Healy-Rae, who has given commitments the <Col N="1437" /> length and breadth of the country to individual members of the Milk Rights Group that he supports its case, to back his words with action in the Chamber tomorrow night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to declare my interest. I am a dairy farmer and was one of the lucky ones in that my herd was closed by one animal following testing and I had, therefore, to hold on to many others, resulting in my quota increasing in the period while that of many others decreased. It caused major financial problems, but now at least I have a decent quota for the farm I still own.</P>
      <P>When the milk rights group approached me I did not sign the petition it put forward, but I gave a clear letter of support for the case being put forward by them. Some individuals were very annoyed with me at that time. I wonder what will happen tomorrow night when Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae walks into the House and votes with the Minister, unless the Minister is forced by the Deputy to change his position. Deputy Healy-Rae and his three Independent colleagues were negotiating with the Minister's office today and I hope for the sake of farmers that negotiation was fruitful &ndash; Deputy Healy-Rae claims to be able to do all sorts of things. He guaranteed he would get special status for Kerry, but failed, and unfortunately it might be the same in this case.</P>
      <P>About 110 cases went to the courts and 500 or 600 others have similar rights. I question whether the State should use the Statute of Limitations against people seeking their just rights. The statute was changed in the area of personal activity, and there is a just reason for it to be changed in this situation. I support my colleagues, particularly Deputy Dukes, who have put forward the legal and technical case for this process.</P>
      <P>Farmers should either receive quota or financial compensation. If it is to be financial compensation, the Minister must ensure people who genuinely want to go back into milk production are allowed into the system. I can think of a case, for example, of a family which had about 30,000 gallons under a farm plan and which has bought in more than 100,000 gallons since that time at enormous cost. That may be an extreme case, but there is a need to work out ways of helping such people.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, under the Chairman, Deputy John Browne, reached a unanimous position, put forward by the Milk Rights Group, which would ensure the Minister did the right thing. The Minister cannot ignore the committee structure or the people who voted on the committee. I wonder how some Members can agree on something in a committee and then vote against it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cavan-Monaghan, my constituency, we have few opportunities outside grassland production &ndash; there are very few areas which can produce corn, potatoes, etc. Therefore, milk production is of extreme importance. While additional quota was received this year, the Minister should have made <Col N="1438" /> better use of opportunities on previous occasions, when Italy and others received quotas.</P>
    <P>A letter from an individual who had a farm plan drawn up for him by a Government agency and who was told exactly what he should and must do reads as follows:</P>
    <P>This year, once again, I appeal to you for assistance. I started supplying milk in 1979. In 1983 supplies to the creamery were 19,000 gallons. In 1994 my herd had increased and supplies to the creamery were 31,000 gallons. In order to continue in milk production I had no choice but to buy quota and over the following years things got no better.</P>
    <P>Farmyard pollution control necessitated building a slatted shed and then dairy hygiene regulations meant I had to build a milking parlour. Every step of the way I complied with Department regulations. Never have I qualified for any assistance, be it national reserve allocation, subsidised restructuring scheme or the financial rescue package. Capital expenditure on my part over the past years has been huge but if the quota base year had been 1984 instead of 1983 I would automatically have had 12,000 more gallons and may not be in a financial crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;accepts that the position taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in response to the demands of the Milk Rights Group is the appropriate one in the circumstances and supports the Minister in his handling of all aspects of the milk quota regime.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment, confident in the knowledge that when the House is fully aware of the background to this complex issue it will support the balanced and realistic approach I have taken in dealing with the demands of the Milk Rights Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complex issue which has been around for a long time. The initial decision was taken by an elected Member and the decisions taken since and those not taken were also the responsibility of elected Members and we should not shove the <Col N="1439" /> blame on civil servants in any way. I accept my responsibility in this matter. In relation to the quota as a regime, people may or may not support it. It has upsides and downsides but given that there will be a review of the quota regime in 2003 anybody who dislikes it will have an opportunity to seek to have it scrapped.</P>
    <P>It may be useful by way of introduction to briefly describe why the milk quota regime was introduced in the first place and how the demands of the Milk Rights Group evolved from the operation of the regime. The milk quota regime was introduced by the Council of Ministers in 1984 to combat the structural imbalance in the market for milk and milk products in the Community. An additional levy or super levy was chargeable on milk produced above a specified reference quantity or quota assigned to each member state. This system was initially set to run for a period of five years but was extended first to 31 March 1993 and then to 31 March 2000 and is now due to expire on 31 March 2008 with a review in 2003.</P>
    <P>Ireland's guaranteed total quantity in respect of milk deliveries to milk purchasing creameries, based on national milk production in 1983, was 5,280,000 tonnes plus, out of a Community reserve, an additional allocation of 303,000 tonnes. The national quotas of other member states, as at that time, were, generally speaking, fixed at the level of their milk production in 1981 increased by 1%.</P>
    <P>Although member states were enabled by the relevant Community legislation to constitute reserves of quota, the Minister of the day in 1984 allocated the entire 5,583,000 tonnes of available quota, without holding back any in reserve. The allocation was made to take particular account of the difficult position of small scale producers faced with the prospect of limited output from then on. The decision to issue the entire national Irish quota was taken after intensive consultation with representatives of the farming and dairy organisations.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the consensus at the time was that it was essential that, within the constraints of the system, the country's national quota should be available without delay to be utilised to the maximum in view of the importance of dairying to the Irish economy. I would add that since then, the management of the quota in Ireland down through the years was done in a way which always took special account of the needs of small scale and less well off producers.</P>
    <P>The Community legislation provided that, in fixing an individual farmer's milk quota, account should be taken of certain special situations. These were where the farmer was still then or had during the reference year, been pursuing a development plan under a farm modernisation scheme, where he or she was a young farmer setting up in or new to dairying and where a farmer's milk production during the reference year had been adversely affected by exceptional events, akin to <i>force majeure</i>, such as a serious natural disaster, accidental destruction of fodder or build<Col N="1440" /> ings or a disease affecting all or part of the dairying herd. Only in the latter category, where the dairy farmer had incurred exceptional setbacks detrimental to the size of his quota, was the allocation of special quota made mandatory on the member state. The grant of special quotas to &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers and to new entrants to dairying was at the discretion of the member state.</P>
    <P>The initial view of the Minister at the time was that the special categories of producers referred to in the preceding paragraph could be dealt with by creating a reserve by availing of unused quota held by producers who were not fully utilising their quota or producers who had ceased milk production altogether.</P>
    <P>However, the European Commission took the view that legally the Minister could not make permanent reallocations, as proposed, of unused quota caused by reduced deliveries by producers or quotas freed by producers ceasing production. In view of the Commission's misgivings, the Department in 1984 and in 1985 established reserves to cater for two categories of producer, namely, a national reserve of 7 million gallons in November 1984 set up by means of a nationally funded cessation scheme so that additional permanent quota might be granted to producers the size of whose milk deliveries in 1983 was adversely affected by disease or personal illness. The extra quota was the difference between the beneficiary's deliveries in 1983 and those in either 1981 or 1982, if higher, where animal disease was shown to be the cause, or half that difference in the case of a long-term human illness. A &ldquo;new entrants&rdquo; reserve in July 1985 was established by way of progressive deductions from the quotas of existing suppliers exceeding 20,000 gallons, varying from 0.25% to 1.25% depending on quota size &ndash; the reserve was redistributed, again on a permanent basis, subject to certain ceilings, to persons who commenced milk deliveries between 1 January 1983 and 21 May 1984.</P>
    <P>While no special arrangements were made for &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers under a national reserve during the initial years of the regime, special measures were taken to ensure they were given priority access to additional quota on either a temporary or permanent basis under the schemes introduced as part of detailed implementation of the Community legislation in Ireland. In the first instance, &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers were granted priority access to unused quota, flexi-milk, temporarily allocated after the end of each milk quota year. Furthermore, after 1988, &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers were entitled to receive, at reasonable cost, milk quota on foot of temporary leasing and restructuring schemes, then introduced and administered on behalf of the Department by the milk purchasers. In addition, specific provisions were made for smaller scale &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers under an EU 1% reserve created in 1989.</P>
    <P>When the quota system was extended in 1993 &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers lost their priority to <Col N="1441" /> flexi-milk under the provisions of the relevant EU legislation. I introduced as a national measure a scheme giving such producers some additional quota on a permanent basis. Special quota allocations have been made in recent years to some &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers on the grounds of extreme hardship as a result of financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>A number of &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers pursued a case in the High Court in what became known as the &ldquo;Duff&rdquo; case. This action commenced on 21 February 1990. The 100 or so plaintiffs joined in that action and in associated lawsuits were members of a group called the Milk Quota Action Group and were, or claimed to be, development farmers following dairy investment plans at the time milk quotas were introduced in 1984. Their contention was that the introduction of milk quotas in 1984 prevented them from realising their milk production targets and that the State should have set up a special reserve to cater for them on that account. The proceedings were initiated in the High Court by a plenary summons issued on 21 February 1990.</P>
    <P>They were relying on the first indent of Article 3(1) of Council Regulation 857/84 which stated that producers who were implementing milk production development plans under Directive 72/159/EEC lodged before 1 March 1984 may obtain according to the member state's decision a special reference quantity taking account of the milk and milk product quantities provided for in the development plan.</P>
    <P>The claims of the plaintiffs were dismissed by the High Court after a full hearing in a judgment delivered on 10 July 1992. The court held that the power to grant special quotas to &ldquo;development plan&rdquo; farmers was a discretionary one and that it had not been exercised arbitrarily in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The judge concluded that it seemed to him that &ldquo;the unhappy situation in which the plaintiffs find themselves is not due to any legal wrongdoing on the part of the Minister or the State&rdquo;. The plaintiffs appealed this High Court judgment to the Supreme Court and on 14 January 1993 the Supreme Court referred certain questions to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.</P>
      <P>The European Court, in its ruling of 15 February 1996 on these questions, again held the power in question to have been discretionary and that the Minister had not, in relation to the plaintiffs, breached any rights available to them under the fundamental principles of European law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court, however, on further consideration of the matter, by a majority of three to two, ruled in the plaintiffs' favour. While accepting the judgment of the European Court that special provision for development farmers was optional, the majority ruling of the Supreme Court was in favour of the plaintiffs. The ruling was on the basis that the Minister made a mistake in law by not establishing a national reserve, which he was legally obliged to do in order to deal with mandatory provisions, thereby debarring himself from exercising any discretion in favour of the development farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court also held that, as a matter of national law, the plaintiffs had a legitimate expectation that the Minister would honour his commitment to them to develop their holdings by exercising his discretion in granting them quota. The Supreme Court ordered, on 7 March 1997, <Col N="1443" /> that the proceedings be remitted to the High Court for the assessment of damages suffered by any of the plaintiffs. On 25 March 1999 the High Court, as a preliminary matter, ruled that the extra quota which the Minister might have bestowed had he not committed a mistake of law was 50% of the difference between the quota actually generated in 1983 and the amount of milk production projected for the final year of a producer's development plan. Based on this formula, claims of seven of the eight plaintiffs in the Duff case have since been assessed. The other claims, representing the 100 or so persons involved in the associated cases, have still to be settled.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the Milk Rights Group was formed in the aftermath of the Supreme Court judgment. The group's objective was to secure, on behalf of its members, treatment similar to that secured by those who had won the test case and those in parallel actions. I understand that the group has a membership of 1,200, or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>I have indicated my position in relation to the demands of the group to Dáil Éireann on a number of occasions in reply to parliamentary questions, and I also outlined this in my response to the Chairman of the Oireachtas joint committee on 19 July last. I also made my views known in the course of an Adjournment debate in the Seanad on 22 October 1998. My position has been that no special provision has been made in respect of any persons or group of persons who are not party to the legal proceedings in the Duff case and other associated cases. Furthermore, I have received legal advice to the effect that any proceedings that may be initiated by such persons are barred by the passage of time. I have written likewise to some of the Deputies who have proposed this motion.</P>
    <P>In last week's issue of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>I read a statement, attributed to Deputy Dukes, that the Government should &ldquo;stop hiding behind technicalities and give these people justice&rdquo;. The matter is not, of course , as simple as that. I do not think the statute of limitations ought to be considered a technicality, and Members of this House should understand that point. The statute must be presumed to have been enacted by the Oireachtas for the common good and in pleading its provisions in regard to time I am merely taking my stand on the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, a Government dealing with cases such as this must have regard not only to the situation of the persons involved but also to that of the general taxpayer on whom the cost of every settlement would ultimately fall. I must also have regard to the overall interests of the milk sector. Let us look, therefore, at the possible costs involved. The Milk Rights Group estimated <Col N="1444" /> compensation of £40 million to £50 million plus eight million to ten million gallons of quota. That, of course, refers only to the 1,200 or 1,300 farmers in the group. There are, however, many other farmers who were in the farm modernisation scheme or rescue package in 1984 and who had dairying plans. These could number between 15,000 and 16,000. There was a total number of 22,000 in the farm modernisation scheme at the time. If all these cases were to come forward, additional quota amounting to 40 million gallons could be involved, as well as compensation approaching £500 million.</P>
      <P>The figures used in the above estimates, while crude, are based on the outcome of the cases already heard by the High Court. While it may be argued that a high proportion of those referred to might not at this stage pursue any possible claims, there can be no certainty about that. The likelihood is that a high proportion would pursue such claims.</P>

      <P>The experience in relation to the Mulder situation would indicate that to be the case. In taking the position I have on this matter, I have taken account of a number of factors. First, there is the fact that though a case in relation to this matter was initiated in February 1990 and ruled on by the High Court as early as July 1992, no legal cases were initiated on behalf of the persons represented by the Milk Rights Group. Neither were any cases initiated on behalf of the group following the Supreme Court judgment of March 1997. Second, I have taken account of the initiatives introduced over the years, some of which I referred to earlier, to give priority access in the allocation of quota to development farmers.</P>
      <P>A number of meetings have been held over the past 18 months or so between the Milk Rights Group and officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, at the request of the group and on a &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; basis. At the most recent meeting on 27 April the group's representatives confirmed that their objective was to secure extra milk quota for their members and suggested that this might be met out of the additional quota which I secured as an outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
      <P>I am not being hard-hearted or obstinate in this matter. I am dealing with an issue that is extremely complex, has gone on for a considerable length of time and has implications for the generality of milk producers in that there is limited quota available. It is also the case that the State simply cannot take on legal responsibilities where they do not exist, as has been suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, notwithstanding the position outlined earlier and despite the fact that there is no legal obligation to go further towards meeting the demands similar to those represented by the group in question, I am prepared to look at what <Col N="1445" /> can be done in the context of the additional quota which will become available on 1 April 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are roughly 11 million gallons of milk quota available to be distributed. I want to make it clear, however, that the amount of quota is limited and if quota is allocated to producers in this category it will mean that there is less to go to other deserving cases. There is not a Member in this House, representing a rural constituency, who has not been asked to help people out with an additional milk quota, either at a clinic or meeting dairy farmers socially. Many farmers just do not have adequate quota and everybody would like to help, especially if such farmers are the smaller, less well off producers who are committed to the industry and who have demonstrated this commitment in the past.</P>
      <P>There is also the fact that the potential number of applicants for quota in the development farmer category could be very high, although I do not know how many additional ones would come forward. All I can say is that the number is likely to be higher than the numbers represented by the Milk Rights Group. If this were the case, the amount of milk quota to go around would be limited.</P>
      <P>As the Minister in 1983-4 consulted the various social partners in the industry, so have I, specifically the Milk Quota Review Group which represents all the farming organisations and bodies. It is representative of all the major players in the industry and has helped me and previous Ministers, having regard to its views, to arrive at decisions on milk quota over the years. I have also consulted it on this matter. I will also have regard to the views of the Attorney General given the complex legal issues surrounding this matter.</P>
      <P>One thing is certain, we know the amount of milk available must be allocated between now and 1 April next because the next milk quota year commences then. I am prepared to look at what can be done for the people in this category in the context of that additional quota and what might be done to help the members of this group and the other members with development plans in the years immediately concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate and to indicate that the Labour Party will support the motion without equivocation. I am one of the few people present who has been a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food over the past number of years where there has been intense focus on this topic. The members of the Milk Rights Group would attest to that. I congratulate that group and its committee for the dedication and commitment it has given to this <Col N="1447" /> matter and to Mr. Ned Nagle, its agriculture consultant, who has worked extremely hard in this regard.</P>
      <P>It should not have been necessary for this motion to come before the House. It has been clear for some time, especially since the 1997 Supreme Court judgment in Duff <i>v.</i> Minister for Agriculture and Food, that an injustice was done to an estimated 800 to 900 development farmers who had been denied milk quotas since 1984 when the milk quota regime became a reality for the dairy farming industry. The vast bulk of those farmers, 35 or 36 of whom live in my constituency, who are scattered throughout the rural areas, are generally small farmers whose continued existence is essential to maintaining the fabric of rural Ireland. Some of them have gone by the wayside, as someone said earlier. Those who have struggled on against the tide have made a major contribution to the rural areas and communities in which they live.</P>
      <P>As an agricultural consultant, I have dealt with some of those farmers. As a barrister, I am in the position that I understand the advice the Minister has been given by the Attorney General and its motivation. However, there is a difference between the legal strictures or impositions of statute law and the legal moral force of a case which is clearly evident here. One must take advice but one may also believe that the moral force of the argument is such that one does not have to rely upon the advice.</P>
      <P>The Statute of Limitations Act was brought into being in 1957 and amended in 1991 for certain circumstances to bring legal certainty, especially in the ownership of property. That was one of the major issues. It was also brought in for claims against the State. In this case, property rights are being claimed and a resort to the Statute of Limitations means it is being used as a sword rather than a shield to ensure legal certainty.</P>
      <P>It is never the wrong time to do the right thing. The Minister has examined section 2(1) of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act and has received advice. He is being told that, if the people in the Visitors' Gallery and the 800 or 900 people they represent throughout the country, including those in my constituency of Westmeath, believe they have a case, they should have initiated it by March 2000. Bringing cases can be a very severe imposition in terms of funding, especially given that a legal precedent exists which sets out that there was an undeniable mistake in law made in 1984 when this EU regulation was brought into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a denial of a property right to these people, who are easily categorised. I put various questions to them and their consultant when they were before the joint committee. I know the legal advice of the Minister and one of the arguments of his officials is the opening of the floodgates, and the Minister indicated at the end of his speech that that is one of his concerns. One <Col N="1448" /> can appreciate that, but I understand that this group, which has existed since 1997, has travelled a circuitous route to try to ensure the people directly affected by this directive and its implementation in 1984 have been identified. It has a number of files with which it is prepared to furnish the Minister to help him in this regard.</P>
    <P>The joint committee indicated that the Department should advertise to ensure no one who should be included was excluded. That is always a concern. An advertisement with a time limit of two or three weeks to help ensure that everyone involved was identified might have been the way forward and the committee made a recommendation in that regard from which no one deviated. The joint committee did not prescribe a solution and that is important to note. It left open the possibility of obtaining a quota to compensate them for their losses. In fairness to the group, it was not looking for the optimum but a reasonable amount which would give its members the opportunity to continue in farming, to earn a livelihood and to pass on a valuable and tangible asset to their families. This is important, given the threats. The 2010 report highlights the fact that it is getting more difficult for people to remain in full-time farming which is what many of these people who struggled against the tide would like to do. The Minister could achieve this through a quota allocation, compensation, a combination of both or whatever other measures are possible.</P>
    <P>The plaintiffs in the Duff case claimed an entitlement to a milk reference quantity or quota under Article 3(1) of Council Regulation 857/84. This article provided for special or additional quotas in particular circumstances otherwise than by reference to the quantity of milk or milk equivalent sold by the producer. Two formulas were involved. Formula A applied to milk or milk equivalent sold by the producer and formula B applied to that purchased by a co-op or factory. Both formulas referred to the base year which, for Ireland, was 1983 and 1981 for other countries, such as Italy. The additional quantities were not part of an increased quota designation for Ireland but had to be drawn from a reserve. This was one of the difficulties at the time. This reserve had to be constituted by Ireland from within the given or designated quantities available.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to refer to the farm modernisation scheme. The scheme was designed to help restructure agriculture on the basis of assisting farmers who had the occupational skills and agricultural resources to adopt rational methods of production with a view to the formation and development of farms which would enable farmers in this category to attain a level of earnings compatible with those in the industrial sector. ACOT was the Department's implementing agency. I was a private consultant at that time and opportunities to participate in ACOT were limited.</P>
    <P>The directive laid special emphasis on the preparation of a development plan which had to iden<Col N="1449" /> tify the work to be done and the period within which the expansion could be achieved. It also provided that those farmers who implemented such a plan should be encouraged and aided financially by a system of incentives and grants. ACOT was charged by the Department to ensure the implementation of the scheme. The aim was to draw up a plan which would show an expanded farm output sufficient to generate an income which would compare favourably with the average earnings of a farmer's industrial counterparts.</P>
    <P>All the plans drawn up envisaged expansion of or entry into dairy farming which was the backbone of many rural areas. The real threat was that many of the plans of Milk Rights Group members would not have come to fruition until after 1983 which was the base year. The scheme was an attempt to achieve viability for thousands of farmers. It follows therefore, despite the fact that farmers who embarked on these expansionary plans with the full support, guidance and encouragement of the State, through ACOT, with clearly identifiable annual output expansion targets, could be allocated any of the milk quota they expected to get in respect of the gallonage projected in the development plans even though the production targets in the plan were achieved, as that gallonage was not sold or purchased in the base year of 1983. The crux of the problem was that those people who had just entered the plan or who were in mid plan but who had not achieved the target set out, were cut off in mid stream. It was as if their life saving equipment was taken from them and they were left to paddle their own canoe, with nowhere to go. They were often distraught and struggled because they were in a five year plan.</P>
    <P>Depending on the stage their development plans had reached with reference to 1983 and the amount of expansion envisaged by the scheme, the quota allocated to farmers could be very nominal. Some farmers who thought they might get 15,000 or 20,000 gallons only got 2,000 gallons. These people were left high and dry.</P>
    <P>Interest rates in the period 1979 to 1981 were 20% or 21%. Inflation was rampant and in double digits. Huge sums of money were borrowed from financial institutions to help major infrastructural undertakings such as land reclamation, new silage pits, cubicle housing, cattle crushes, concrete yards, milking parlours and machines and the purchase of additional cattle. Each step of the plan was carefully circumscribed and overseen by ACOT. Consultants did not get a look in. A farmer might have achieved only 10,000 gallons under the plan in 1983 but would have been designated between 20,000 or 25,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>Before 1983, not achieving such targets was insignificant as farmers never anticipated that the circumscribed milk production would evolve into a super-levy and the imposition of a national quota. Because these farmers did not have the capacity or the quota to produce and achieve their planned output, they found themselves unable to meet substantial financial commit<Col N="1450" /> ments. Some farmers went out of business while others struggled on without the opportunity to reach their potential output. Farmers believed they would be protected because they had prepared plans and expanded production in accordance with the development plans.</P>
    <P>In complying with European and national directives it is clear these farmers had a legitimate expectation of bringing their plans to fruition. This legal argument found positive expression in the 1988 Mulder case in the European Court of Justice. If these people do not get a special allocation at this stage the State is guilty of negligence and a breach of duty in allowing and encouraging them to prepare plans they were not allowed to bring to finality. The Statute of Limitations arises but farmers were encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>The then Minister probably thought he was doing his best and we will not say that everyone was involved. Much consultation took place and it was agreed that no national reserve should be created. The Minister referred to this outcome. It was also agreed that the entire national quota should be allocated to co-operatives. The then Minister appears to have been of the view that he could make provision for development farming out of the flexi-milk supply which was available. However, the EU Commission intervened some months later and knocked this suggestion on the head which meant that permanent quotas could not be allocated from the flexi-milk supply. This was a mistake. Mr. Justice Barrington, who was held in high esteem, had served on the European Court of Justice for several years and was very <i>au fait</i> with European law, decided it was mandatory on the Minister and the Department to provide a quota for farmers with diseased herds and that the Minister should also have used his discretion to establish a quota for young farmers and for development farmers.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court found this situation to constitute a fundamental mistake in law in that the Minister failed to establish a national reserve as he was obliged to do under EC regulations. The Minister had an opportunity to keep his commitment but he flunked it and put himself into a position where he could not exercise the discretion vested in him and which he should have done. Tonight we ask the Minister to recognise the legal difficulties involved and not behave like an ostrich burying his head in the sand. The Minister now has an opportunity to rectify an injustice which those people suffered. It has had a crippling and damaging effect in so far as it has curtailed their ability to reach their potential, something which is important to them but which is essential to us as a nation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Barrington made no bones about it. He said:</P>
    <P>The State, on its own behalf and as agent for the European Commission, induced these farmers to borrow money and to develop their farms on the basis that there would be an expanded outlet for the sale of their milk. Now, <Col N="1451" /> long after they incurred heavy expenditure, they find that they will not get the outlet for the sale of their milk which they expected and were induced to believe they would receive.</P>
    <P>He then referred to Council Regulations EEC/856/84 and EEC/857/84, the two EEC Council regulations which combine to form the milk super levy system which came in at that time. As somebody who has taken some quota regime cases, I know they are a legal minefield. It is virtually impossible for anybody to deal with them with any certainty. It is something which we might get an opportunity to discuss in this House at some future time.</P>
    <P>While the general principles of Community law might not provide a basis for member states to provide for the grant of special reference quantities or quotas to producers, there is nothing to prevent such a requirement being founded in the principles of domestic law. That is an essential point in the Supreme Court's findings. That is where the people who constitute this group have found solace and inspiration to carry on their fight. That means that although there was nothing in the general principle of Community law to compel the Minister to provide a grant of a special quota, there was nothing in it to prevent him from doing so either. That was the essential point. That argument was made but it died in the Supreme Court and this obviously affords protection to producers such as the Milk Rights Group. Therefore domestic law provided greater protection to them than that available under the legal principles applicable in the Community legal order.</P>
    <P>The principles of the protection of legitimate expectations and the assurance of legal certainty are all certainly part of the Community legal order. That principle, the principle of legitimate expectations, is important. It cannot be used to enforce the view that the law will not ever be changed by the EU, but it can be utilised by people such as those in this group who set out on a course of action, expended money and acted to their detriment. While in strict legal terms the Minister could come in and argue, as he must do, that the Statute of Limitations applies, defences like that would fall if they were argued in court in an equity case. This is a different situation but in such equity cases where somebody has acted to their detriment and incurred fairly substantial expenditures, one could make such an argument. Whether such an argument would succeed is open to question, but certainly I would be prepared to make it.</P>
    <P>Three classes of farmers could qualify for the extra milk under Article 3 of Council Regulation EEC/857/84. As Mr. Justice Barrington stated in his judgment in the Duff case, the Minister made a mistake in law in failing to establish a national reserve to facilitate the three categories and in particular in the case of development farmers and the young farmers, the eggs had been scrambled and could not be unscrambled. That is why those <Col N="1452" /> people were left high and dry and therefore the allocation was gone. It was critical.</P>
    <P>In other circumstances, for instance, if it happened in the late 1980s or early 1990s, we would find it difficult to come into this House to argue a case for compensation but now we are fairly well off, although there are huge number of people excluded from this wealth. The economy should serve society and society should not be beholden to the economy. There is a huge number of people excluded and the Minister should use the resources available to help the 800, 900 or 1,000 people and compensate them for an injustice done to them.</P>
    <P>It is a matter which we in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine have discussed <i>ad nauseum</i>. I uphold the view of my colleagues on that committee, that there is a moral obligation to compensate those farmers for a mistake of law arising in 1984 which had nothing to do with them. That is the essential point.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he has referred this matter to the Milk Quota Review Group. We hoped the group would come up with a solution but it is putting it on the long finger. Some member of that group is afraid to make decisions.</P>
    <P>We are not privy to much of what goes on and there is an attempt to make sure we do not know, but we find out. I understand there was a whirlwind of activity today and we all anticipated that the Minister would arrive into the House as if he were Santa Claus arriving early bringing some goodies. In the end he arrived with a bag but there were no goodies. At the end of his speech, he tried to leave a gap open. I suppose that if I were in Deputy Sheehan's constituency, I might try and leave some gap open also.</P>

      <P>While I have some understanding of the points the Minister made, this case is one where the Minister should not adopt a defensive &ldquo;gung-ho&rdquo; attitude in which he relies on a statute which exists to bring certainty to the law to ensure that people are aware of their legal rights and can assert them at a point in time. That did not apply in this case. There was not a fundamental mistake made by the people involved. Once the regulation took effect in Ireland, the farmers followed the letter of the law. They carried out instructions according to the letter of the law. Therefore they are not responsible.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in making cases for people who have contributed to their own downfall, although it would be acceptable for me to do so in a criminal case, where I must make a case.</P>

      <P>If the people involved, some of whom are from my county and are in the Public Gallery, were responsible and had contributed to their own downfall, one would have to accept <Col N="1453" /> that. However, in this case, where they came into court whiter than white because they complied with everything asked of them, it appears they set off on a trail which was incorrect because of the Department's interpretation, application and implementation of the EC directive. If there was a mistake, in fairness I am sure it was made in all innocence. However, the outcome of that mistake should not be visited on people who are innocent and have done no wrong. My plea to the Minister this evening is on behalf of the 1,000 people still active and working in this area. Many of them are married with young families and are struggling to make ends meet. It is about time the Minister brought this matter to an end and rectified an error which was not of their making.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to share my time with Deputy Enright. This is an issue of great importance to every student. In 2000, we must recognise finally that a student maintenance grant of £49 per week is insufficient and inappropriate. In recent years, the rate of increase in the student maintenance grant, the support structure, has been minimal. The increase in the cost of accommodation, travel, food, etc., is three or four times greater than the increase, in percentage terms, in the maintenance grant. That cannot continue if we are to give access to all to third level education.</P>
      <P>The decision of the last Government to introduce the free fees system was very welcome and has been a godsend to thousands of students. Getting to college and having college fees paid is only half the battle. The student must meet his or her commitments each week. It is impossible to do so on the grand sum of £49. We must stop the platitudes and stop talking about our fine young people and their great efforts to build up the country. We must ensure that instead of paying lip-service to students, we pay them a realistic level of college support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will tell me of yet another review to look at this subject. Over the past decade, four or five different reports have been produced on this subject but, unfortunately, they are not being acted on. If the current initiative of the Minister to again look at the system of student grants, the level of maintenance, etc., is going to take another six or 12 months, it will mean students will be surviving on pennies for the next year. It is causing a high drop out rate among students because they simply cannot afford to remain at college and that is a great tragedy. It is a tragedy for those who worked hard at second level in order to obtain a place at third level to have to give up that place because they <Col N="1454" /> cannot afford to pay the weekly costs of being a student.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government want to be realistic they should forget about commissioning extra reports because all the work has been done and all the statistics are available. They should give a clear commitment to introduce a realistic level of student support. I challenge any Member of this House or anybody outside it to try to exist in one of our major cities on £49 per week. I know one could not do so and yet that is what we expect of third level students. I ask the Minister of State to relay to his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Woods, the need for immediate action. We do not need more reports, we have plenty of reports. We need action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bradford for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter. I will outline for the Minister of State the case of a young person looking for a maintenance grant and will give him the name and address later. The parents of this young person applied to Offaly County Council for a maintenance grant and they sent in everything on time. I communicated with Offaly County Council on 1 August and received correspondence from it refusing the grant to this person because the family income exceeded the guidelines.</P>
      <P>I took the matter up with the Minister, Deputy Woods, on 5 September. I wrote him a very comprehensive letter outlining the full details and I enclosed the letter from Offaly County Council. I asked the Minister to use his discretion to allow this person a higher education grant. I outlined the fact the father was suffering from a brain tumour for which he was receiving considerable treatment and that he had to attend Beaumont hospital frequently. It has been an ongoing problem for a number of years. I also outlined the fact the mother had lost the sight in one eye and was in danger of losing the sight in the other eye. I explained to the Minister the ongoing cost of laser treatment.</P>
      <P>I received an acknowledgment from the Minister on 21 September. I took the matter further and sent the Minister another letter on 2 October and I telephoned him. The father is seriously ill and the family does not have a medical card. These are ordinary working people who are barely above the guidelines. They have been refused a higher education maintenance grant. It is a shame. If I gave this story to the <i>Sunday World </i>or some other newspaper, I guarantee the Minister would pay it. I am not looking for any publicity but for honest and fair play in this case. I would ask the Minister of State to look after the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Enright wishes to give me the name and address of the person, I will certainly pass it on to the Minister and ask that he reply to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities <Col N="1455" /> (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
    <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase the rates of third level maintenance grants annually in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. Last June, in line with this policy, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant and 5% in the qualifying income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. The reference value for inflation for the purpose of the annual review is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to February. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins the Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard, there is provision in the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently established an action group on access to third level education with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students. This action group will advise the Minister on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. The group, which has held four meetings to date, has been asked to provide a report within three months.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, the Minister has announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows, from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>As regards the future administration of the schemes, Department officials have been engaged with officials from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in relation to possible options.</P>
    <P>On 1 November, the Minister also announced that he is setting up immediately a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students.</P>
    <P>The review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and <Col N="1456" /> income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team will be asked to report by the end of March 2001.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for choosing this matter on the Adjournment. The one-day rail strike, which has paralysed train services the length and breadth of the country once again, is but another example of how industrial relations in many of the State utilities have gone off the rails. The frightening aspect of each of the disputes is not only that there is no solution in sight for any of them, but they are all at a stage of strike, go slows or work to rule. The consequences for the economy and consumers are very serious.</P>
      <P>On the current Iarnród Éireann dispute, there are no trains operating today apart from the DART services in Dublin. The withdrawal of labour by signal staff is the third rail strike this year. There has already been industrial action by permanent rail staff. Throughout the summer services outside Dublin were crippled for ten weeks because of the ILDA dispute. In spite of the fact that IFI in Arklow was closed down for weeks because of lack of supplies and the tourism industry was devastated, there was an eerie silence from the Minister and a marked disinclination by the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission to get involved. Finally, after millions of pounds in losses to Iarnród Éireann and multi-million pound damage to the economy, both the LRC and the Labour Court were eventually prevailed upon to try to work out a solution. As in the present dispute, why was decisive action not taken earlier?</P>
      <P>Today's dispute concerns a new basic pay rate and new working arrangements by signal staff. My understanding is that unless a resolution is found to this problem, services will be again immobilised on 22 and 23 November and successively afterwards. We are told the company accepts that basic pay rates are low. Why then was it not possible to head off today's action by getting meaningful dialogue under way? There is now news that DART drivers are also serving notice of their intention to strike on 20 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adding to the current climate of poor industrial relations, the Minister and the company could be heading for yet another confrontation with ILDA because of the unprecedented leaking by the Labour Relations Commission to a Sunday newspaper of a summary of the alleged findings of a rail safety consultants report on safety concerns expressed by the train drivers before the joint Labour Court-Labour Relations Commission, which was charged with the investigation, prior to the completion of the report. This is an extremely serious breach of long-established procedures. What, if anything, has the Minister <Col N="1457" /> and the Tánaiste done to establish the source of these leaks?</P>
    <P>There is a huge industrial relations malaise within Iarnród Éireann. There is one litany of disputes after the other, with endless problems and inconvenience for passengers and industrial users. Unless the industrial relations problems within Iarnród Éireann are sorted out soon, irrespective of the investment poured into the rail system, there will be constant disruption and trouble ahead. It goes without saying that there is an urgent need for the Minister to carry out an immediate and detailed examination and audit of the human resource section and human resource policy of Iarnród Éireann and CIE to establish why they have not been more successful in building a peaceful industrial relations climate in the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I agree with everything he said.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of grave concern that approximately 130 signal persons are on strike today in Iarnród Éireann, which has had the effect of closing down the mainline rail network and discommoding 50,000 passengers. I think of stations in Mullingar, Maynooth, Celbridge and so on which are in darkness and have no trains operating. This is not a once-off action and further actions are threatened next week in pursuit of demands. The action follows a breakdown in talks in recent days on new pay arrangements and conditions for signal persons.</P>
      <P>A low basic pay regime, supplemented by overtime and allowances, has been a feature of Iarnród Éireann down the years. On putting proposals on the table, the company is endeavouring to address those issues. Signal persons currently work on average approximately 60 hours per week. The new proposals on offer from Iarnród Éireann include a pay deal with better basic pay and conditions, including a 48 hour week. When the deal is agreed, once-off compensation for individual loss of earnings will be paid on a scaled basis up to a maximum of £20,000, under a general formula predetermined by the Labour Court. For example, an employee who loses up to £3,200 per annum as a result of reduced overtime will be compensated at a rate of 2.5 times the loss, that is, £8,000. An employee who loses £5,000 will receive compensation in excess of £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This dispute has been the subject of very extensive talks with the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. The issues have been refused and referred back to the parties on several occasions. The Government is committed to the future development of the railway system by providing in excess of £2.2 billion to public transport. A significant proportion of this, £1 billion in total, has been provided for investment in the rail network. Crucial to the success of that investment is confidence in the capacity of CIE and Iarnród Éireann to deliver these ambitious targets in a <Col N="1458" /> cost-effective manner and on time. Increased customer confidence in a reliable and effective service is also critical to the successful development of the public transport option.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the recent and ongoing cycle of industrial relations unrest has the potential to further undermine confidence in the railway system at a time of unprecedented levels of investment. Iarnród Éireann cannot develop the public transport rail network required for the future development of the country where successive claims by one group after another are adversely affecting customer confidence.</P>
    <P>There is a need to restore good working relations and focus on the primary objective of the company, the delivery of quality rail transport. The taxpayer needs to be assured in relation to the capacity of CIE and Iarnród Éireann to deliver the targets set out in the national development plan. Customer confidence in a reliable and effective service is also critical to the successful development of the public transport option.</P>
    <P>After consultation today with the social partners and the management of CIE, I am arranging to meet all the parties involved tomorrow with a view to discussing a new way forward for dealing with the industrial relations environment of Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise this matter this evening and I am pleased other Deputies are doing likewise.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express the sense of outrage that exists at decisions being taken without adequate public debate. I thank organisations such as AFrI whose publication Towards Real Security sought to initiate a debate and make points for which I and others are grateful. There are a number of important outstanding issues which require not just a Dáil debate, but public debate. For example, the force to which the Minister, on behalf of the Irish people, will make a commitment has not been defined in terms of what it is purported to deal with. To put it simply, the conflicts with which the rapid reaction force is alleged to deal have not been defined, nor have the ranges of response been specified. A number of other questions arise when one begins to think about the issue, that is, which conflicts are envisaged, which responses would be appropriate, how would they be legitimised, what would be the source of legitimacy, with what possibilities for accountability and with what consequences for peacekeeping operations? That to which we lend ourselves has a relationship with NATO. The deficiencies which have been spoken about by those who will participate have been structured by NATO in terms of technical equipment. This <Col N="1459" /> raises the question of why we are taking such a momentous decision without public debate.</P>
    <P>The people with whom the Minister will sit down are people who speak about raising the proportion of gross domestic product in different countries so as to create a force that will be effective and meet the gaps which have been identified by others. He may defend himself by saying we will have the right to choose that with which we will relate ourselves. However, this sacrifices a fundamental principle of foreign policy. The cornerstone of Irish foreign policy was the building of security through greater reliance on nonviolent skills and the use of diplomacy as a set of tools of prevention.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter with a great sense of anger at images I have seen. As an Irish citizen I felt humiliated by the sight in an Irish newspaper of the Taoiseach in military uniform with his companion. When I read the justification of the rapid reaction force in terms of its capabilities I think of the bad faith of Rambouillet where we saw that the diplomatic game was not over, indeed had not really begun, before those with military intent were ready to act. We are witnessing the defeat of diplomacy by militarism.</P>
    <P>We are also witnessing the appalling suggestion that we increase expenditure on equipment and release men for tasks that have no generic relationship with the traditional tasks of peacekeeping carried out under the mandate of the United Nations. Will the Minister tell the House how he proposes to meet his commitments without implication for the traditional tasks mandated by the United Nations? How can he go to a meeting which calls for increased expenditure on arms and forges an even deeper alliance between those who produce and sell armaments and those who determine policy while suggesting that we will be short of troops to participate in conflict resolution and peacekeeping in different parts of the world? We are told the Defence Forces are to integrate seamlessly, but with what and with what accountability?</P>
    <P>I am not so naive as to say there should not be a discussion of our obligation towards the structures and institutions of security within the European Union. However, I resist the suggestion that issues of defence, defence purchasing and the sale and production of armaments can be used as a substitute for a genuine consideration of security.</P>
    <P>How can one say it is of no importance to go to a meeting and say how a force will be deployed? How does the Minister reconcile the statements that this will be a global force with other statements that it will be parallel to NATO and yet others that it will not be in competition with NATO? These are matters of the greatest import. It fills me with great sadness to think we can drift without accountability towards commitments that have implications for the fundamental principles of our foreign policy and support actions that will be taken in our name.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> My position is not merely irredentist and opposed to security. Other countries will make and sell equipment and we, with other Third World countries, will be asked to supply bodies. I hope the world examines what happened in Kosovo, looks at the statements of Lord Robertson and Javier Solana and concludes that to reduce war to a video game while inflicting dreadful damage on the civilian population and civilian infrastructure was an appalling degradation to humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredible that the Government, in a week's time, will pledge nearly 1,000 Irish troops as well as military equipment to an EU rapid reaction force without any discussion, debate or analysis in this House. What implications does this commitment have for our neutrality, our role as UN peacekeepers, the size of our military budgets and our involvement in the arms trade? What are the implications for the future of the EU as it develops a military wing? What is this rapid reaction force for and what can we do within this force that we can not already do within the United Nations? The answer to the last question is truly worrying.</P>
      <P>Next week Ireland is to join an EU force of more than 200,000 troops with the ability to deploy up to 80,000 troops within 60 days to a range of 4,000 kilometres, far beyond the EU's borders. The EU will seek 350 combat aircraft and 80 warships. There have already been significant informal pledges of troops and equipments including, for instance, an aircraft squadron of F-16 planes from France and, possibly, a nuclear powered aircraft carrier. The command structure for this force is already evolving. There are four EU-NATO working groups in progress and the September joint meeting of the EU-NATO ambassadors has been viewed as a significant step towards strengthening EU-NATO links.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister will tell us this is all about peacekeeping, peacemaking and humanitarian missions &ndash; the, so-called, Petersberg Tasks approved in the Amsterdam Treaty. The Irish people were grievously misled during the Amsterdam Treaty referendum. The Government did not spell out what peacemaking actually meant. It means enforcing peace or making war to make peace. The Minister would be hard put to point to any war in history which was not defined in such a way by those fighting in it.</P>
      <P>When the Irish voters approved of the Amsterdam Treaty they were not approving the establishment of a European army of more than 200,000, which is what this rapid reaction force will be. The Government vehemently denied at the time that the treaty would lead to a European army but this is what we are getting. The President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, said:</P>
      <P>If you do not want to call it a European army do not call it a European army. You can call it Margaret. You can call it Mary Ann. You can find any name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> That is a contemptuous statement.</P>
    <P>What is to become of our UN peacekeeping role? Two former Chiefs-of-Staff have publicly voiced their concerns about whether we can play both roles, one in the UN and one in the EU. Something has got to give and it is obviously to be our highly reputable UN peacekeeping. Plans are now under way to withdraw our UN peacekeeping forces from Lebanon. Protestations from the Minister that Irish troops in the new Euro army will only operate under a UN mandate are totally misleading. All other EU states have not agreed to this. The real reason for this EU force is to by-pass UN mandates and to allow the EU to go it alone in the military field and to ignore the UN Security Council. If this is not the case why create an EU rapid reaction force in the first place? Why not operate through the United Nations?</P>
    <P>We are aware that UN mandates can be open to misinterpretation. We need only look at the former Yugoslavia, Kuwait and the disgraceful ongoing bombing of Iraq. As Ireland assumes a UN Security Council seat, an honour due in no small part to our neutrality and our highly respected UN peacekeeping reputation, the Government has decided to undermine, not only our neutrality but the United Nations itself by establishing a rival and extremely dangerous international security body.</P>
    <P>In the campaigns for the referendums on the Single European Act and the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, the Green Party has been steadfast in highlighting the dangers to our neutrality from the creeping militarism of the European Union. This militarism is no longer creeping. It is proceeding in leaps and bounds. I am appalled by the latest recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces which states, &ldquo;The Celtic tiger needs more claws&rdquo;. Who do our armed forces intend to maul, in whose name and for what purpose? Does the economic growth of our Celtic tiger economy really require military claws?</P>
    <P>The Green Party asks the Minister to make no commitments at the EU meeting next week. I ask him to make it clear that the Irish people have not yet been consulted on this important departure from our traditional policies and that a period of consultation or a referendum is now required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>That the Deputies raised this important matter gives me an opportunity to deal with a number of points in relation to the EU Headline Goal. I am concerned that the issues as presented in the two matters put forward by Deputy Higgins and Deputy Gormley are different from reality and I welcome the opportunity to address many of the misapprehensions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next Monday, the planned EU Capabilities Commitment Conference will take place. This conference represents the culmination of a range of planning work directed at giving effect to the Treaty of Amsterdam and the more recent EU <Col N="1462" /> Council decisions at Cologne, Helsinki and Feira in relation to security and defence matters.</P>
    <P>I have at earlier stages, in reply to parliamentary questions, set out the position in relation to the EU Headline Goal as it has evolved, most recently on 24 October. Current developments are based on the aim of the Amsterdam Treaty's objectives of making the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy more effective, coherent and visible. The treaty's provisions concerning security and defence, focus on a range of humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks, known as the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the Cologne, Helsinki and Feira European Councils provided clear political directions for the further steps needed to enable the European Union to take effective actions and to have an operational capacity for peacekeeping and crisis management operations. With regard to the decisions of the EU Council, a number of points are noteworthy. The elaboration of the Headline Goal will facilitate the achievement by 2003 of an EU capacity to conduct the Petersberg Tasks. The development by the EU of this role is consistent with Ireland's tradition of involvement in UN peacekeeping missions.</P>
    <P>Developments towards the achievement of the Headline Goal for the development of capabilities for the Petersberg Tasks do not envisage the creation of a European army. This reality was explicitly stated in the conclusions at Feira in June 2000. The focus is on Petersberg Tasks, not mutual defence, on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty. The Cologne European Council in June 1999 clearly identified the issue for the EU as the Petersberg Tasks and not mutual defence commitments which are appropriate to alliances.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently sought to ensure a fully inclusive approach to European security issues. In this regard, the centrality of the UN and the primary role of the UN Security Council in matters of peace and security is explicitly recognised by the EU. Ireland would only participate in missions authorised by the UN. Finally, participation in an individual Petersberg Tasks mission remains a sovereign decision by the Government in every instance and on a case by case basis. Any decision to participate would require Dáil approval in accordance with existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence, published earlier this year, sets out key elements of Government policy on overseas peace support operations. It recognises the important role these operations have as an element of Ireland's foreign and security policy and as a demonstration of support for the United Nations and the conduct of international relations according to the UN Charter. Furthermore, the White Paper sets out a comprehensive development strategy for the Defence Forces to ensure that they are geared to face the challenges and opportunities of the evolving defence and security environment. Most importantly, the White Paper makes provision for <Col N="1463" /> a significant new equipment investment programme.</P>
    <P>Following the decisions taken at the Cologne European Council in June 1999, the Helsinki European Council adopted the concept of the EU Headline Goal for the provision of military self-sustaining forces of up to 15 brigades or 50,000 to 60,000 persons to undertake the full range of Petersberg Tasks. These forces are to be capable of being deployed at 60 days notice for up to one year and available in 2003 and are required to have the necessary command, control and intelligence capabilities, logistics and so on.</P>
    <P>The Capabilities Commitment Conference which takes place in Brussels next Monday and Tuesday is intended to enable EU member states and other countries to indicate formally the capabilities which they have available for the Headline Goal. Earlier today, the Government approved proposals submitted jointly with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in preparation for next week's conference. The Government's decision authorises the commitment of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within the current United Nations standby arrangements system commitment of 850.</P>
    <P>As participation will only arise where UN authorisation is in place, the commitment to the EU Headline Goal will not impinge in a negative way on the overall thrust of the overseas peacekeeping effort. As participation in any individual mission will be considered by Government on a case by case basis, this will enable us to determine on each occasion how best to balance commitments to an EU led operation, under UN authorisation, with our support for UN led peace support operations within the overall number.</P>
    <P>It is planned that the proposed commitment of up to 850 personnel will mainly comprise a light infantry battalion of up to 750 personnel, an Army Ranger Wing platoon of around 40, in addition to small numbers in headquarters, national support and observer elements. The precise configuration of any particular deployment as regards numbers or equipment will be based on the task required and the situation at that time. An important infrastructural support for future overseas operations will be the acquisition of new armoured personnel carriers being funded through the reduction in personnel numbers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> The planned contribution to the EU Headline Goal does not degrade our commitment to UN peacekeeping. This contribution reinforces in a conspicuous way our continued intention to support efforts to maximise international peace and stability. At a time when the UN increasingly looks to regional organisations to undertake peace support operations on its behalf, it is critical to support efforts at EU level to give effect to the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam. What is involved in developing the Headline Goal is no more than giving effect to the treaty.</P>
    <P>As the White Paper on Defence recognised, and the Deputies will agree, Irish soldiers have played a significant role in seeking to bring peace to many parts of the world and have deservedly won the respect and admiration of people at home and abroad. The loss of personnel while undertaking overseas peacekeeping tasks is a sacrifice which we must not ever take for granted.</P>
    <P>We must continue to give due emphasis to the necessary training and equipment to undertake peacekeeping missions. Ireland's membership of Partnership for Peace will be an important support in this regard. PfP provides a menu of training opportunities which will seek to ensure that the Defence Forces can continue to participate in modern peacekeeping missions and achieve the levels of inter-operability appropriate to these. The PfP Planning and Review Process &ndash; PARP &ndash; is also important with regard to planning for Petersberg Tasks. Like the other neutral EU states who participate in the PARP, Ireland proposes to use the PARP as a mechanism for planning in relation to the Headline Goal.</P>
    <P>The recent Brahimi report on the overhaul of UN peace operations contains many points of similarity with the approach taken by the EU on capabilities, including rapid reaction. My Department has indicated to the Department of Foreign Affairs that it will provide whatever assistance it can in relation to Brahimi implementation issues. EU and UN processes should be mutually reinforcing. EU-UN relations in the military crisis management area are likely to be further developed during the forthcoming Swedish Presidency. In keeping with what I have said already in relation to the importance of the UN, the Deputies can be assured that this is an area in which Ireland will seek to provide a positive impetus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive are the only directives relevant to the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The Habitats Directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, in March 1997 under the last Government. A total of 363 sites, covering over 800,000 hectares have been publicly proposed for designation and receive protection in Irish law from the date of public notification in each case. Prior to my appointment as Minister, no sites had been formally transmitted to the EU Commission but I have since transmitted 320 sites. I have accepted an obligation to transmit the balance by the end of this month, in the context of approval of EU funding for the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission initiated proceedings against Ireland for a failure to implement the EU Habitats Directive in March 1999. The failure related to the non-transmission of special areas of conservation as required by Article 4(1) of the directive. At that time Ireland had advertised 207 sites but only 48 of these had been formally transmitted. The Irish defence to this case has been submitted to the European Court of Justice and an oral hearing has been requested. As previously stated, my Department has now formally transmitted 320 candidate SACs to the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The EU Birds Directive requires member states to establish special protection areas for areas hosting internationally important populations of bird species and for bird habitats. 110 SPAs have been established to date covering 220,000 hectares of land and my Department has agreed to extend some existing SPAs and designate some new SPAs in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Commission has initiated proceedings against Ireland in connection with overgrazing and the decline of the red grouse population in the Owenduff-Nephin Beg complex, a special protection area for birds under the EU Birds Directive. The rural environment protection scheme, administered by the Department of Agri<Col N="1466" /> culture, Food and Rural Development, together with farm plans implementing stocking levels set by commonage framework plans will alleviate and recover the situation. I am awaiting approval from the EU Commission for my Department's scheme before implementing these plans. I am confident that all these measures will, when fully implemented, redress the problem of overgrazing. The commonage plan for the Owenduff-Nephin Beg complex is ready for implementation, and will be initiated as soon as my Department's scheme receives approval from the EU Commission. In the meantime my Department in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office has prepared a robust defence of the case.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that at the end of last year I initiated a process of public consultation on the review and consolidation of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994. This process was completed earlier this year and my Department has evaluated the submissions received. A significant range of issues has arisen through the public consultation process and the internal departmental review. I have decided to publish an outline of the issues and this document will be available shortly. It will clarify the matters involved for the public as well as illustrating the scale and complexity of this task.</P>
      <P>As I have stated before, it is my intention that the process will involve the consolidation of national monuments legislation as well as its revision and extension to ensure the protection of the archaeological, architectural and historic heritage. I plan to bring draft proposals for legislation to the Cabinet during the first half of 2001.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the report prepared for the Heritage Council which showed a severe decline in the number of well known bird species due to changes in farming methods; the steps being taken to deal with the threat to these species and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent report by the Heritage Council highlights that a number of birds in agricultural areas such as the grey partridge, turtle dove, corn bunting, yellowhammer <Col N="1467" /> and linnets have suffered serious contractions in their breeding range. Many formerly common and widespread bird species have suffered declines in numbers &ndash; in some cases contractions in their ranges &ndash; due to agricultural intensification, mechanisation and other changes in agricultural practices.</P>
      <P>The protection afforded by the designation of special protection areas, natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation will contribute to the maintenance of suitable habitats for wild birds including the birds in question. This, together with the environmental benefits from improved practices under the rural environment protection scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, will, I believe, represent a significant benefit for the protection of all our wildlife, including the bird species referred to above.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has also supported specific conservation initiatives on two endangered species of farmland birds, the grey partridge and the corncrake. The grey partridge project, part-funded by Dúchas since 1991, is a programme of survey, research and management of remaining wild populations. The rural environment protection scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the corncrake grant scheme, funded by Dúchas since 1993 in partnership with BirdWatch Ireland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, encourage farmers with nesting corncrakes to farm in a corncrake friendly manner.</P>
      <P>As a response to the scarcity of quantitative data available on these birds, a countrywide bird survey was set up in 1998. Dúchas has been partners in and co-funders of the countryside bird survey since its inception in 1998. This is a nationwide annual monitoring programme which quantifies population changes of common Irish birds and will be a valuable database for assessing the impact of changes on farmland birds in the future. Such data will facilitate a response to threat in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to set up a national trust as suggested by the Deputy. The State already has a sizeable portfolio of more than 700 national monuments and historic properties which are in the care of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. The resources required to conserve and manage such properties are already considerable and continue to increase. While it is neither feasible nor desirable for the State to control all heritage properties, I am obviously conscious of the need to support the protection of the architectural heritage not in State care.</P>
      <P>The national heritage plan, which will be published shortly, will outline the future approach to the protection of heritage properties in private ownership. This will include the use of the Planning and Development Acts, the completion of surveys such as the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, and increased levels of training in skills and craft areas which are crucial to the protection of heritage in private ownership. Of course, owners of heritage properties may receive assistance under the conservation grants scheme announced last year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and also under the provisions of the Finance Act in respect of maintenance works carried out to heritage properties which are open to the public.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the report commissioned by the Heritage Council and I have already welcomed the publication of the report on this subject as it brings a new focus to the problem of the destruction of archaeological monuments, which has been a source of concern to me and the heritage service of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously acknowledged that this problem exists, notwithstanding the significant legislative powers which are available to me. However, I am satisfied that good progress is being made by my Department in protecting our archaeological heritage notwithstanding the increased impact on that heritage arising from the upsurge in development work on foot of our unprecedented economic growth. A number of improvements which will support the protectionof the archaeological heritage have been recently introduced by me. These involve the following: the resolution of the long-standing contractual difficulties in relation to the archaeologists employed on contract in my Department. The people involved have now been given contracts of employment for five years; the provision of an eight additional archaeological posts in the archaeological service of my Department; addressing the backlog of archaeological licence reports and reducing the period for processing new applications; agreement on a code of practice with the National Roads Authority on the protection of archaeological sites under its road development programme. This code will serve as a model for similar codes with other development <Col N="1471" /> sectors with whom discussions are already under way; advancement of plans for the re-organisation of structures and resources that will give a regional focus to the operation of the archaeological services, thus providing better service delivery to many of the Department's customers. A key feature of this will be a localised system of monitoring sites that the Heritage Council has identified as being threatened by destruction and; promoting the recruitment by local authorities of their own archaeologists.</P>

      <P>My Department has undertaken archaeological excavation and a detailed site survey of the Rock of Dunamaise to expand the knowledge and history of the site and to clarify the purpose and sequence of the structures which survive there. In this way an informed judgment can now be made as to how the conservation works should proceed. On this basis, a schedule for a pilot programme of conservation works has been prepared and is due to go to tender soon. The results of this pilot programme of conservation works will allow for a full specification and schedule of works to be prepared as well as a working methodology to be established. It is envisaged that these works will continue over the lifetime of the current NDP, up to 2006.</P>
      <P>The programme involves the following elements: conservation of vulnerable masonry structures such as the gate tower and the inner ward wall which were uncovered during excavation; conservation of all other structures; provision of safe access; ground clearance and presentation; provision of information signs-panels; floodlighting.</P>

      <P>The main elements of the development programme for the built heritage under the national development plan, which I announced in Ennis on 5 November, are as follows. There will be expenditure of £78 million on capital projects in the period to 2006. Some £65 million will be allocated for work on major projects and £13 million to undertake minor works which inevitably arise with a property portfolio of 740 properties. There will be an allocation of £3.5 million to enhance the existing education and visitor services of my Department. This funding will be used to used to attract additional visitors to less popular sites and to extend the season at as many as possible of the Department's sites. There will be an allocation of £4.5 million in the period to 2006 specifically for a programme of upgrading existing exhibitions and audio visual displays at a number of existing sites and an allocation of £1 million to accelerate the installation of information panels at sites around the country which are popular with visitors but where there is no guide service. There will be an allocation of £1.7 million in the period to 2006 for an extensive apprenticeship programme, primarily in the crucial skills of carpentry, stonecutting and stonemasonary. To commence this initiative I am hopeful that 2001 will see as many as 20 young people commence training in their chosen field.</P>
      <P>While much of the country's heritage not in State care can and will be protected by the Planning and Development Act, 2000, I am anxious that my Department continues to play a proactive role in this area. To this end I announced an allocation of £9.8 million towards what can be broadly described as assisting in the regulation of the built environment. This provision will enable me to accelerate architectural and archaeological surveys so that planners and developers can be better informed before making project decisions. Efforts will also be made to promote the recruitment of archaeologists in planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy I set out on 5 November for the built heritage area in the period to 2006 is comprehensive and wholly realisable and its full implementation will ensure the continued conser<Col N="1475" /> vation and protection of our national monuments and historic properties in that period.</P>

      <P>The Habitats Directive requires the favourable conservation status of the listed habitats and species to be maintained or restored. Management plans are not a formal requirement but are one of the appropriate measures that may be used to achieve this.</P>
      <P>My Department is preparing management plans for special areas of conservation and special protection areas as an aid to landowners and land users to meet these requirements. My Department has recently undertaken a pilot programme of public consultation regarding management plans for a number of sites, in order to establish an effective system for suitable public consultation. This system will be applied to public consultation about draft management plans for all other sites for which draft plans have been prepared, including one covering the conservation requirements of Bull Island. No plan will be finalised until after the public has been consulted.</P>
      <P>In the meantime it should be noted that most of Bull Island is managed by Dublin Corporation which is aware of the conservation interest involved and which, in respect of planning law, is obliged to ensure the favourable conservation status of the island is maintained.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should know that any activity or development likely to have a significant adverse impact on the site is obliged to undergo an appropriate assessment of its likely impact on the conservation interest involved.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that I explained in my reply to Question No. 86 of 4 Deireadh Fómhair 2000 that the board of the National Theatre Society Ltd. had submitted a number of options to me in relation to the redevelopment of the Abbey and Peacock theatres and indicated that its preferred option was for the redevelopment of the theatres on the existing site at an estimated cost of £50 million. I sought the advice of the Arts Council and the Office of Public Works on this option with a view to bringing proposals to Government.</P>
      <P>Recently, however, the board of the National Theatre Society indicated to me that, on foot of a proposal put to it by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, its preferred option now is to relocate the national theatre to a site at the Grand Canal Dock, subject to the funding package being available and terms being agreed with the Dublin Docklands Authority. The society has now advised that it would cost between £75 million and £90 million to develop a high quality landmark theatre on this site. I am now evaluating this option, in particular the financial support that will be required from Government.</P>

      <P>Under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, Irish must be used as the normal spoken language of the applicants household before a grant can be sanctioned. It is not intended to change this condition.</P>
      <P>The type of applicants referred to by the Deputy are treated with understanding and flexibility by my Department. Quite often, in order to help these households establish Irish as the normal spoken language, a time period is given &ndash; three or six months normally. Subsequently, my Department is prepared to re-examine the application and to consider all aspects of the case before a final decision is made.</P>
      <P>It was to help households like these that Scéim Spreagtha na Gaeilge was established in 1980. Any applicant who is refused assistance under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts because of Irish can apply to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the first time new house grant. If, in the meantime, the applicant can establish Irish as the normal spoken language in the new house, he can apply for assistance under Scéim Spreagtha na Gaeilge. This is worth £800 within two years and, together with the grant from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, a total of £3,800 is payable to the applicant compared to a Gaeltacht new house grant of £4,000.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994-99, planning authorities are obliged to notify certain prescribed bodies of planning applications received by them, depending on the impact of the proposed development on the remit of the body concerned. My Department, as the State authority charged with the protection and conservation of the nation's natural and built heritage, is one of the prescribed bodies. Where such applications are referred to my Department, they are assessed by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, and, where necessary, a submission is made to the planning authority.</P>
      <P>Between 1 January and 3 November this year, my Department received 6,300 such planning and development notifications. Some 129 objections were lodged with planning authorities in the same period. Having made such recommendations, it becomes a matter for the planning authority to determine the application under the local government (planning and development) code and neither my Department nor I is party to such decision-making process. None of the 129 objections related to road works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general where my Department has concerns about the impact of such proposals on the built and natural heritage, it will endeavour to have such concerns addressed at the pre-planning stage <Col N="1483" /> of the proposed development. Many proposed developments are discussed with my officials in advance and this has given the opportunity to provide advice at an early stage to balance development with conservation. Very few applications, about 2%, which would impact significantly on the built and natural heritage are opposed and this pre-application consultation mechanism can help avoid delay. The volume of referrals by planning authorities has grown from 2,700 in 1995 to 7,700 in 1999 and it is not possible to have consultations in all cases.</P>
    <P>I should also state that a code of practice has been agreed between my Department and the National Roads Authority relating to the protection of archaeological sites in the context of its road development programme.</P>
    <P>The question of objections by bodies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the intended bodies concerned.</P>

      <P>Salmon is one of 200 animal species listed in the EU Habitats Directive. Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, did not initially propose special areas of conservation &ndash; SACs &ndash; for salmon. It was felt that the protection afforded the species through the regimes operated by the fisheries boards were sufficient to secure its conservation. However, following discussions at the Atlantic Region Biogeographical Conference held in 1999, salmon has been formally included as species to be conserved in 13 existing SAC sites.</P>
      <P>My Department has held no discussions with the Commission on this matter other than those within the framework of the biogeographical conference and no such meetings are anticipated in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that my primary responsibility under the Wildlife Act, 1976, is to protect seals and other mammals to ensure the conservation of the species as a whole. The care of individual seals is an animal welfare matter for which I have no function under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>The work of the Irish seal sanctuary is primarily of a welfare nature. It involves the rehabilitation of individual seals and, as such, does not come within the remit of my Department. On a number of occasions I have acknowledged the worthwhile nature of the work carried out by the Irish seal sanctuary and recognised the commitment of its members. However, from a conservation point of view, the work does not impact significantly on overall seal numbers.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of the Irish seal sanctuary last year at their request to discuss their future plans for the sanctuary and officials from my Department later examined a draft development plan prepared by the sanctuary. The Irish seal sanctuary has made many approaches in the past for aid in running its existing facility at Garristown but the fact remains that the proposed new sanctuary is a rehabilitation facility which caters for a relatively small number of injured seals rather than contributing to the overall conservation of the species which is my concern. Considering the plan has a very strong tourism element and a strong appeal for environmental tourists, I suggested that they seek funding under tourism development budgets.</P>
      <P>There are no plans, therefore, by my Department to make provision for the funding of the Irish seal sanctuary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Habitats Directive requires member states to propose relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation for the conservation of listed habitats and species, and to protect their favourable conservation status. It also requires member states to transmit a list of the proposed areas together with full information on each site to the EU Commission, within three years of the date of the notification of the directive, but no member state met <Col N="1485" /> that deadline. The directive specifies scientific criteria for the selection of these areas.</P>
      <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. A total of 363 sites have been publicly proposed for designation and receive protection in Irish law from the date of public notification in each case.</P>
      <P>I have formally transmitted 320 of these sites to the EU Commission since coming into office. I have accepted an obligation to transmit the balance by the end of this month, in the context of approval of EU funding for the national development plan. In the light of evaluation of our proposals at EU level my Department is examining the question of proposing additional SACs for raised bog and for salmon. Any additional sites will be publicly advertised in 2001 with a view to transmit them to the EU Commission by June 2001.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that the Irish list will be found to be sufficient at the next Atlantic Region Biogeographical Conference due in September 2001.</P>
      <P>The formal designation of SACs does not occur until after the commission has adopted national lists of sites. No national lists have been adopted to date. I am unable to say therefore, when the directive will be fully implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is acutely aware of the importance of our sites to the tourism sector, and thus takes an extremely pro-active approach to promoting them, including: the production of a range of high-quality promotional material, available in several languages, and distributed within Ireland and overseas <i>via</i> Bord Fáilte market offices, regional tourism authorities, bed and breakfasts, hotels, etc.; attendance at major overseas trade and consumer pro<Col N="1486" /> motions in key markets, for example UK, US, France, Germany, Benelux and Italy, and at travel trade workshops in Ireland; advertising the heritage card in key tourism publications; ongoing contacts with tour operators, Bord Fáilte personnel, and travel writers; upgrading the Heritage of Ireland website and participation in promotional schemes aimed at domestic and overseas markets.</P>
      <P>With regard to education, I have always believed the effective communication of the conservation message to children of school going age is a key element in our efforts to effectively protect our heritage in the long-term.</P>
      <P>Towards that end, I have instructed the education and visitor services division of my Department to examine how this message might be better delivered to schools, and in that context a number of avenues are being actively considered. These include a more effective system for liaison by my Department's heritage sites and properties with local schools, the preparation of an appropriate heritage module for use at transition year level, and a video which would present the essentials of the heritage message in clear and easily understood terms.</P>
      <P>Some of these proposals will take longer to pursue than others, and may have staffing and other resource implications which will have to be evaluated. Relevant issues will also have to be fully discussed with the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>In January this year, I announced a scheme of free educational visits for schools, under which primary and secondary school pupils have free access to Dúchas sites on a pre-booked basis. Since then, 27,279 pupils have visited heritage sites under this scheme. I believe that, as this scheme develops further, it will give many more school children a real experience of their heritage, which they will learn from and enjoy.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department has been actively promoting the activities of the national cultural institutions which include the Chester Beatty Library, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Archives, the National Concert Hall, the National Gallery of Ireland, National Library of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland and The National Theatre, Abbey and Peacock Theatres.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the Department decided to specifically market the national cultural institutions internationally and developed a unique design concept, Dublin: A Magical Trail of Culture, which was successfully translated to a range of promotional material and advertising media primarily a high-quality colour brochure, comprising, for the first time information on the group of institutions concerned. This promotional activity was targeted to the overseas markets, primarily Britain, North America, France, Germany and Italy. This year it was decided to raise the profile and highlight the activities, valuable resources and social events at these Institutions to the domestic market utilising the Dublin: A Magical Trail of Culture concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> The initiatives taken this year include the expansion and enhancement of the brochure, as well as the production of a combined programme of events taking place at each of the institutions for the period November 2000 to February 2001. In line with the tourism generation potential of these initiatives, it was my pleasure to have launched this inaugural publication at the World Travel Fair in London this week. In addition, my Department in association with the institutions themselves has organised the production of a new TV commercial, which is currently being broadcast on the four national TV channels, aimed at raising the awareness of the public to the wealth and variety of these resources.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> I received a formal outline application on 5 October 2000 from RTE for an increase in the television licence fee. On 31 October 2000, I received documentation in support of the application.</P>
    <P>The application will receive careful examination in my Department and my proposals will be brought to Government in due course. In this regard, I refer the Deputy to my answer earlier today to a priority question on this matter.</P>
    <P>Television licences may be purchased at any of An Post's nationwide network of post offices. An Post estimate the level of evasion to be 10.5% at present. It should be pointed out that not every country calculates the level of evasion in the same manner and superficial comparisons with other countries can be misleading. An Post is also considering additional methods of pursuing evaders and more flexible payment methods.</P>

      <P>Our officials have also been consulted by the IIF about the draft code of practice. The draft code sets out the conduct to be followed by the industry in Ireland in relation to use of genetic tests and seeks to balance the legitimate interests of insurers and of the totality of policyholders with the concerns of individual consumers. My understanding is that the industry intends that applicants for insurance policies will not be required to undergo a genetic test in order to obtain insurance. However, in accordance with current requirements that a client act with utmost good faith, life assurers expect individuals who have previously undertaken a genetic test to disclose full details at application stage. This is to protect the insurance company and to protect other insurance policyholders who would have to pay more into the insurance pool.</P>
      <P>I understand that the industry is prepared to agree to ignore the results of genetic testing in respect of mortgage protection policies up to a limit to be determined. In addition, no one will be required to disclose the result of a genetic test taken after the policy is taken out nor the test results of any relative. I understand that the draft code confirms that existing provisions relating to confidentiality of medical evidence will also apply to genetic information.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the initiative by the industry, I am conscious of the need to consider whether Government regulation in this area is warranted. As I have said, there are complex issues at stake, including public health concerns. Accordingly, I have asked that a process of consultation with interested parties be undertaken by my Department. When this process is completed, I will consider what, if any, action is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 to 171, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objective of the National Biotoxin Programme is to protect public health and safeguard the position of the Irish shellfish industry by ensuring that shellfish placed on the home and <Col N="1496" /> export markets comply with the highest standards. The programme has been comprehensively reviewed in recent months and is being further reinforced at present. The Molluscan Shellfish Safety Committee, chaired by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, is the forum representing all key agencies and the industry which is overseeing the changes in train.</P>
    <P>Resource requirements for the natural biotoxin programme are being significantly enhanced. The recruitment of additional staff for the Marine Institute's national biotoxins reference laboratory, and for my Department's sea fisheries control division is getting under way.</P>
    <P>Chemical testing of shellfish is in place for the testing of scallops for the presence of domoic acid using the HPLC method. Chemical testing of shellfish on a nationwide basis for the presence of a range of biotoxins, including AZP, is being fully scaled up at the Marine Institute and Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of seawater samples for the presence of toxic phytoplanktons has been carried out by the Marine Institute on a seasonal basis since 1989. This programme is being comprehensively scaled up to provide a year round service from 1 January next.</P>
    <P>The closure and re-opening of shellfish production areas is undertaken on the advice of the Marine Institute. Re-opening of a closed area is permitted only where results for two successive weeks confirm that shellfish samples from the area are not contaminated by biotoxins. Changes to these arrangements could only be considered after detailed scientific investigation which would show that an alternative arrangement fully safeguards public health.</P>
    <P>Species specific closures of shellfish production areas are already operated in certain circumstances where the scientific advice indicates that such a course of action is an appropriate measure for the protection of public health. The question of a more extensive use of such closures will require further scientific investigation by the Marine Institute, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and my Department.</P>
    <P>Fresh shellfish samples from producers have been frozen at the Marine Institute or at associated laboratories on 11 occasions, involving 43 samples, during 2000. I am advised that sample results will be made available to producers by the Marine Institute within 48 hours of receipt of the sample at the relevant laboratory. This follows the introduction of twice weekly sampling and testing of shellfish production areas from last September. The arrangements for conveying sample results to producers are being kept under review with the objective of ensuring that results are transmitted in the most timely and effective way achievable.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-06, a figure of IR£20 million over the seven year period has been allocated to the marine leisure and tourism sector, with improvements in access infrastructure, including marinas, slipways, etc., highlighted as requiring special attention. These moneys will form an integral part of the Regional Operational Programme 2000-06.</P>
      <P>Among the elements that will need to be decided upon in any ensuing detailed scheme in relation to the marine leisure and tourism measure are: the type of projects eligible for aid; the rates of aid for each type of project; the monitoring and financial systems to be put in place; the specific eligibility criteria for deciding on access to any aid; and the format of application form to be used. This scheme is not expected to be in place before the end of this year or the beginning of 2001. Until then formal applications for grant-aid cannot be received.</P>
      <P>During a recent visit to Ballycotton, I suggested, and it was only a suggestion, that a leisure development by Cork County Council might be capable of being funded in part at least through related commercial development such as holiday homes. Such a suggestion did not imply that this was to be a requirement for possible assistance under the marine leisure and tourism measure mentioned above in respect of marine access infrastructure. Nor was it implied that this was an activity in which Cork County Council was obliged to get involved in. On the other hand, there are limits on the availability of funds from central sources and local authorities should in partnership with the private sector seek out innovative funding mechanisms to support local marine leisure infrastructure development schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no direct role in the removal of the sunken tug boat at Clogherhead Pier, there are clear statutory powers and responsibilities in the Merchant Shipping <Col N="1499" /> (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, which address the removal of wrecked vessels where they pose a threat. There are three key statutory provisions in the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, which govern the removal or rendering harmless of wrecked vessels. First, section 51(2) of the Act places a responsibility on the owner of a wreck to remove or render it harmless where it is likely to become an obstruction or danger to navigation or to lifeboats engaged in the lifeboat service, or a threat of harm to the marine environment or related interests, which include fishing and tourist activities, which constitute the means of livelihood for persons concerned, and the tourist attractions of any area concerned.</P>
      <P>Second, section 51(3) of the Act empowers appropriate authorities, which are defined as harbour authorities, local authorities and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, to serve a notice on an owner requiring the owner to remove or render harmless a wreck in these circumstances. Third, under section 52 of the Act, the appropriate authorities also have certain powers to themselves remove or render harmless an offending wreck and to recover the expenses incurred from the relevant person. The relevant person is defined as the owner of the wreck at the time when it sunk or was wrecked, grounded, stranded or abandoned. While harbour authorities' and the Commissioners of Irish Lights' powers to remove a wreck arise only where it is likely to be an obstruction or danger to navigation or lifeboats, local authorities &ndash; in this instance Louth County Council &ndash; have further discretion to act if the wreck constitutes a threat to the marine environment or to related interests. I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The EU Common Strategy on the Mediterranean, which builds upon the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, seeks to support the efforts of Mediterranean partners to attain the goals agreed under the Barcelona Declaration which was adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the EU member states and Mediterranean partners at the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Conference on 28 November 1995. Under the strategy, the EU will work to develop good relations in the region; improve prosperity and eliminate poverty; promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy, good governance and the rule of law; promote cultural and religious tolerance; and develop co-operation with civil society, including NGOs.</P>
      <P>Ireland strongly supports the common strategy and together with our EU partners sees the promotion of a prosperous, democratic, stable and secure Mediterranean region as being in the best interests of the EU as well as of its Mediterranean partners, and as an important aspect of EU policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland worked closely with EU partners on the elaboration of the common strategy which situates the EU's undertakings in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in an overall policy framework. In particular, we sought throughout to <Col N="1501" /> ensure that the strategy was coherent and comprehensive in setting out an EU vision for the region, together with areas of action and specific initiatives which would enhance existing EU relations with the countries of the region.</P>

      <P>The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership meeting at Foreign Minister level in Marseilles on 15 and 16 November will continue the work of developing and strengthening the partnership, following on from the Stuttgart ministerial conference last year which called for the elaboration of a Charter on Peace and Stability in the Mediterranean region. I will attend this meeting.</P>
      <P>The intention is to negotiate an evolving framework agreement to enhance the implementation of the Barcelona Declaration for the purpose of avoiding tensions and crises and promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the region. In discussions on the charter, Ireland has sought to maintain a strong focus on human rights and the promotion of the role of civil society.</P>
      <P>It had been hoped that the charter would be adopted at a summit to be held in Marseilles on 17 November. However, while significant work on the charter has proceeded, the current situation in the Middle East has caused some of our Mediterranean partners to delay its adoption at this time.</P>
      <P>Ireland places a high value on the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership as a gradually evolving forum for the cultivation of regional stability, prosperity and inter-cultural harmony, and would therefore hope to see the charter adopted at the earliest practicable date.</P>

      <P>Thirty-six countries are expected to qualify for assistance under the World Bank and IMF's enhanced heavily indebted poor countries debt relief initiative, HIPC. Thus far, eleven countries have qualified for relief under the enhanced framework &ndash; Benin, Burkina Faso, Bolivia, Cameroon, Honduras, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda &ndash; with total committed assistance estimated at roughly US$18 billion. Côte d'Ivoire, Mali and Guyana had already qualified under the original framework. By the end of 2000 it is hoped that up to one half of the 40 HIPC countries will be eligible for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC. Some <Col N="1502" /> of the remainder cannot meet the qualification criteria because of civil strife. When completed, it is expected the HIPC initiative will deliver more than US$50 billion in debt service relief to eligible countries.</P>
      <P>Since the World Bank and IMF's meeting in Cologne in September 1999, a number of major creditor countries have announced their willingness to write off 100% of the debts owed to them by countries qualifying for enhanced HIPC debt relief. In July of this year, the EU announced a contribution of over 1 billion to debt relief efforts. The contribution is a timely and crucial step forward in a concerted international effort to remove the burden of unsustainable debt. The majority of the contribution &ndash; 734 million &ndash; is directed to the HIPC Trust Fund, of which 300 million is being made available immediately. This contribution by the EU is the single largest, equalling roughly one-third of the total amount pledged to date by all donors. Of the more than 1 billion contribution, 680 million will be directed to the trust fund to help multilateral creditors provide debt relief to HIPCs which are members of the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) arrangement with the EU. Another 54 million will be made available to the trust fund for countries in Latin America and Asia which are not ACP members. Finally, 348 million will be used to reduce debt owed directly to the EU.</P>
      <P>Although not a bilateral creditor of the developing countries, Ireland strongly welcomes measures, whether through debt relief or debt cancellation, aimed at easing the burden. At the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Prague in September, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, supported calls for all bilateral creditors to implement an immediate moratorium on bilateral debt repayments for the world's heavily indebted poor countries, stating that an immediate debt moratorium would free up resources for heavily indebted countries to spend on urgent social priorities and poverty reduction strategies.</P>
      <P>Ireland has already contributed US$15 millions to the HIPC Trust Fund. We have also provided assistance of IR£9.5 millions directly to a number of heavily indebted countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Ireland is also responsible for a proportionate share of the EU contribution of 1 billion to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Our share is about 6 million.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's recent announcement at the UN Millennium Summit of the Government's commitment to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for ODA in 2007 and an interim target of 0.45% in 2002 should enable us to devote more resources to deal with the debt issue both bilaterally and multilaterally.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which the Government proposes to monitor and influence the IMF's pro gramme in low-income countries, now called poverty reduction and growth facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>To reflect a strengthened emphasis on poverty reduction, the International Monetary Fund's &ndash; IMF &ndash; concessional facility for low-income countries, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), was renamed the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in November 1999 and given new terms of reference. The earlier ESAF had been criticised by Ireland and others for the stringent conditionality under which it operated and for its insufficient focus on poverty reduction. Several of the points made by Ireland in its national submission on the review of ESAF were incorporated into the new instrument with the subsequent adoption by the IMF of the PRGF.</P>
      <P>The PRGF now governs the fund's lending to low-income countries. A total of 80 low income countries are eligible for PRGF assistance. Eligibility is based, <i>inter alia</i>, on a country's <i>per capita</i> income, currently pegged at US$895. Subject to a number of macroeconomic conditions, an eligible country may borrow up to a maximum of 140% of its IMF quota under a three-year arrangement. In exceptional circumstances, this limit may be increased to a maximum of 185%. Loans under the PRGF carry an annual interest rate of 0.5%. Repayments commence five-and-a-half years after the initial disbursement. The loan is repaid over a term of four and a half years.</P>
      <P>PRGF-supported programmes reflect current development thinking in that they are firmly situated within country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving all stakeholders including civil society and other partners. PRGF operates in conjunction with the World Bank's poverty reduction strategy paper approach, PRSP. The intention is to ensure that each country programme supported by the fund's PRGF is consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to promote growth and reduce poverty. Ireland believes that the fund's new framework represents a significant advance on ESAF in view of its enhanced focus on poverty reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the joint statement issued by the IMF and the World Bank in September 2000. The statement, <i>inter alia</i>, says that the two institutions share the same broad objective: helping to improve the quality of life and reduce poverty through sustainable and equitable growth. The statement also helped to clarify the respective roles of the IMF and the World Bank and stressed that they should work in a complementary fashion. A strengthened partnership between the bank and the fund within the context of a shared poverty reduction objective should facilitate a holistic approach to development in which <Col N="1504" /> economic and social concerns are carefully balanced.</P>
    <P>The Department has a number of different channels through which it can form an objective assessment of the performance of the PRGF, particularly in least developed countries. The active involvement of our missions in donor wide co-ordination related to PRSPs allows Ireland Aid to monitor and, wherever possible, to influence World Bank and IMF programmes. In addition, I welcome contributions from the Irish NGO Community many of whom also have a presence on the ground in these countries. The Department of Finance's representatives at both the IMF and the World Bank in Washington enable Ireland to monitor progress and to influence the direction of policy. There is close co-ordination between the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs on the policy issues.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the ongoing civil war in Sudan and the enormous humanitarian impact it is having on the Sudanese people. We have raised these concerns on many occasions, both in public and privately. We attach great importance to efforts to achieve a permanent ceasefire in the civil war and the negotiation of a comprehensive and lasting political settlement.</P>
      <P>As an active member of the International Partners' Forum of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, we will continue to fully support and encourage efforts to bring about progress in the peace talks, and to reaffirm the importance of a constructive dialogue aimed at developing stability and co-operation in the country itself, as well as in the wider region. We will continue to raise our concerns and to offer our support for a long-term peaceful solution through our contacts with the Government of Sudan and other Governments in the region.</P>
      <P>We have appealed to the warring parties to comply with the principles of international humanitarian law, particularly those relating to the safety of UN personnel, as laid down in the Convention of 9 December 1994, and to free access for NGOs to civilian populations in distress. In 1999 the Irish Government contributed £1,085,000 in emergency assistance to Sudan. This funding was channelled through the International Rescue Committee, UNICEF, the International Red Cross, Oxfam, Concern and GOAL. To date this year a total of £702,032 has been allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland will emphasise the importance of the humanitarian dimension in the promotion of international peace and security. We believe that full and timely support for humanitarian needs can be critical in ensuring and enhancing the sustainability of any peace agreement and post conflict peace-building. The Government is determined to play a positive role in conflict prevention and resolution wherever the need arises and will ensure that the humanitarian needs of people affected by conflict are not neglected.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, investment of £500 million in the rail network under the national development plan is focusing on two key <Col N="1506" /> elements: £350 million to complete the implementation of the Railway Safety Programme 1999 to 2003, as approved by the Government in March 1999, which includes replacing jointed track on passenger lines with continuous welded rail, signalling improvements and renewal of bridges and fencing; and £150 million for a renewal-upgrading programme, including the purchase of new rolling stock and equipment and upgrading stations. The renewal-upgrading includes significant investment in upgrading the main intercity routes, including the Athlone-Westport and Athlone-Sligo lines.</P>

      <P>A key element of the strategy to improve public transport under the national development plan is to exploit more fully the potential for development on the suburban rail network for the greater Dublin area. Twenty new railcars will be introduced in the coming weeks on the Dublin-Maynooth service providing a better frequency of service for passengers. As a result, Iarnród Éireann expects commuters between Maynooth and Dublin to use this service to a greater extent than the Dublin-Mullingar service, thus relieving overcrowding and improving passenger comfort for passengers between Dublin and Mullingar.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>The recently published DTO Platform for Change Strategy 2000-2016 proposes an integrated transport system which will meet the long-term transport needs of the greater Dublin area, which includes Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. Part of the strategy provides for the provision of additional suburban stations on the existing rail network, including the coastal suburban line to Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The national development plan published by the Government in November 1999 already makes provision for the investment of £185 million on short-term developments on the suburban rail network in the greater Dublin area. The upgrading of the railway line from Greystones southwards to Arklow forms an integral part of the development plan. You will be pleased to know that work on the Greystones to Arklow line has commenced and the re-laying of four miles of track will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The extension of the DART to Wicklow town or a new suburban rail line connecting Kilcoole to Newtownmountkennedy are not envisaged under the plan.</P>

      <P>I regard animal welfare as a high priority in view of both the legitimate concern that animals be transported in acceptable conditions and the pragmatic reason that it is in the interests of livestock farmers and their families that their animals reach their destination in the best possible condition. I therefore regard rigorous enforcement of animal welfare criteria as vital to our export trade in live animals.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that animals are leaving this country in full compliance with the regulations governing animal health and welfare.

      <P>Under the Agenda 2000 negotiations 20.5 million gallons of additional milk quota were allocated to Ireland with effect from 1 April 2000. Some 20 million gallons were distributed by way of the 15 million gallon scheme, for producers with quotas under 55,000 gallons, and the five million gallon scheme for younger producers. I set aside 500,000 gallons to cater for those producers who for exceptional reasons fell outside the provisions of these two schemes. The eligibility criteria for the allocation of that 500,000 gallons of additional milk quota were published in August 2000. The milk quota appeals tribunal considered the cases under this scheme and made recommendations to me.</P>
      <P>In addition there were a number of applicants under the five million gallons scheme who furnished proof of eligibility after this scheme had been finalised. In those cases, an allocation from the 500,000 gallons was also granted following recommendations from the tribunal. The maximum amount allocated was 2,390 gallons and the minimum amount was 112 gallons.</P>

      <P>Investments in dairying facilities and in pollution control measures have been eligible for grant aid since the introduction of the farm modernisation scheme in <Col N="1516" /> 1974. This grant aid continued for farm plans taken out under the farm improvement programme until 1994. Grant aid totalling some £293 million and £187 million has been paid out under the FMS and FIP respectively of which it is estimated that 80-90% of the grant aid related to pollution control type investments.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development 1989-94 a control of farmyard pollution scheme operated. Under this scheme grant aid totalling £96.4 million was paid to 20,821 farmers.</P>
      <P>In September 1994 a scheme of investment aid for upgrading of on-farm dairying facilities, dairy hygiene, and a scheme of investment aid for the control of farm pollution were introduced under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99. The dairy hygiene scheme had to be suspended in October 1996 when demand for the scheme exceeded the funding available. Some £36.3 million has been paid to 5,013 dairy farmers under this scheme. The control of farm pollution scheme was suspended in April 1995 when the number of applicants had exceeded the financial provision made available for the scheme. All applications received under the scheme were processed and since its commencement a total of 14,250 farmers have being paid grant aid totalling £139.6 million.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the national scheme of investment aid for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards and the national scheme of investment aid for the control of farm pollution were both introduced. The schemes are open to farmers with not more than 100 income units. The schemes aim to provide aid to those farmers who had been unable to avail of the 1994 scheme or in the case of the control of farm pollution scheme who had availed of less than £10,000 in grant aid on pollution control facilities in the 1994-99 period. To date £0.16 million has been paid to 43 applicants under the national dairy hygiene scheme while some 5,700 valid applications have being received under the national control of farm pollution scheme and grant aid totalling £7.1 million has been paid to 1200 farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-06 provision is made for a new enhanced schemes for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards and for farm waste management. These schemes will form part of the new regional operational programmes for the Border, midlands and western region and the southern and eastern region. The operational programmes have been submitted for approval to the European Commission and this approval is expected shortly. It is proposed that both schemes will be open to farmers with a minimum of 20 income units from farming together with sufficient other income to ensure the viability of the farm and a maximum of 200 Income Units including off-farm income. The grant will be calculated at the rate of 40% for farmers having up to 150 income units. Farmers having 150 Income units to 200 income units will <Col N="1517" /> be eligible for a 20% grant rate. In addition, it is proposed that young trained farmers under 35 years will qualify for higher rates of grant aid.</P>
    <P>Pending introduction of the new schemes for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards and for farm waste management, the current national schemes remain in place and applications made under these schemes continue to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 to 215, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department maintains a central register of all overpayments. The purpose of the register is to ensure that any overpayments are registered as soon as possible and that recovery is monitored and effected on an ongoing basis. As the reason for overpayment is distinct to each individual case and relates to specific factors exclusive to the case it would not be possible to register overpayments <Col N="1518" /> by reference to the specific reason for the overpayment. Consequently, it would not be possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy without a full manual examination of each individual case on the overpayments register. If the Deputy wishes to seek information in relation to an individual or a number of individuals I will arrange to provide this information.</P>
    <P>Audit needs are fulfilled by maintaining a register of overpayments and effecting recovery. If an audit query arises it is resolved by reference to the individual file on the case under query.</P>
    <P>In so far as Teagasc is concerned each herdnumber has been individually examined and I can confirm that no overpayment of special beef premium has been made to Teagasc in recent years for reasons associated with multiple herdnumbers held by that body.</P>
    <P>Each herd number held by Teagasc, whether for research or other farming purposes, is in respect of a separate operation-enterprise and is managed as an individual production unit.</P>

      <P>The person named had his participation in REPS terminated because penalties for non-compliance with the scheme requirements, detected in the course of an inspection of his farm in September 1998, amounted to 235%. The matters detected were serious and included failure to maintain records in accordance with the scheme requirements and exceeding the permitted nitrogen and chemical phosphorous levels. He lodged an appeal with the national REPS appeals committee. The committee overturned one of the smaller penalties but the total still came to 225%. The decision of the appeals committee is my Department's final position on any case in which penalties are applied under REPS.</P>
      <P>As the penalties amounted to more than 100%, the scheme conditions at the time required that his participation in REPS be terminated and that he refund all payments received. He was notified of this. When he made no arrangements to refund the payments, my Department had to seek to recover the amount owed from payments due to him under other EU-funded schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to the person named to apply to join the new REP scheme which commences later this <Col N="1519" /> month, but no application could be considered until his existing debt has been repaid in full.</P>

      <P>The person named applied under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 15 beef cows and one other bovine over two years old.</P>
      <P>He was paid his full entitlement of £1,059.75 under the 2000 cattle headage scheme on 19 October 2000. This is in accordance with clause 27 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme which sets limits on the amount of grant to be paid per forage hectare. The forage area as shown on the area aid application for 2000 of the person named was 12.22 hectares.</P>
      <P>Based on this area, the grant payable on the 15 beef cows and the other animal applied on was £1,059.75. If no restriction applied, the grant would have been £1,293. Accordingly, the grant of the person named was restricted by the difference between the two amounts, which was £233.25.</P>

      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%. Therefore, in this case no penalty is applied, leaving the area determined for payment purposes at 11.47 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>While the proposals which are to be adopted through the co-decision procedure &ndash; Council and the European Parliament &ndash; have yet to be fully debated, the main focus of the EFA will be to provide excellent independent scientific advice and establish a network of close co-operation with similar bodies in the member states. It will have a key function in assessing risks related to all food and animal feed operations.</P>
      <P>Its organisational structure envisages a management board with overall responsibility for an advisory forum, comprising representatives of national food agencies in the member states, and a scientific committee comprised of the chairpersons of each of the eight scientific panels which it is proposed to establish together with six other independent experts. The EFA intends to collaborate with scientific institutions in the member states and the joint research centre of the commission to make the best possible use of available expertise. It is expected that the authority will set up fully integrated networks with authorities, universities and research institutes in the member states.

      <P>I draw to the Deputy's attention that the 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the health contribution levy, below which there is no liability to the levy. This threshold was substantially increased in the Social Welfare Act, 2000 and currently stands at £14,560 per annum, or £280 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levy threshold was introduced to focus <Col N="1524" /> assistance on those on low incomes. I appreciate that once a person's income exceeds the annual-weekly threshold the levy is liable on all his or her gross income from pound one and that this creates a &ldquo;step&rdquo; effect at the threshold.</P>
    <P>However, I would point out that the threshold for the health levy is reviewed annually in the context of the budget.</P>

Individuals aged 65 years or over, or whose spouses are over 65 years, and individuals who are unable to look after themselves due to permanent ill health are entitled to a refund of DIRT paid if their income is below the income tax exemption thresholds. In the Budget 2000, I increased the exemption limit for the over 65s to £7,500 single/£15,000 married &ndash; any income earned up to this limit is free of tax.

      <P>The general position is that section 231 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, exempts from income tax the profits or gains arising to the owner or part-owner of a stallion from the sale of services of mares by the stallion where the stallion is ordinarily kept on the land in the State and where the services of the mares takes place in the State. The exemption also applies where a bloodstock breeder trading in the State acquires a share in a foreign stallion in order that mares owned by the breeder may be serviced by the stallion. In this case, the exemption applies to tax on any profits or gains from the sale of any nominations from the breeder's share in the stallion. Taxpayers are not required to include income arising from tax exempt stallion fees in their tax returns. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is, therefore, no basis on which to provide an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of the tax exemption.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a number of years ago, free fees were introduced for full-time undergraduate students in publicly funded colleges in the State. The 1995 Finance Act, introduced tax relief at the standard rate for the tuition fees of full time undergraduate students attending private third <Col N="1526" /> level colleges in the State, provided the course is of at least two years duration. As free fees are available, tax relief is not available for any full time courses in publicly funded colleges and this includes teacher training courses in publicly funded colleges.</P>
      <P>In the 1999 Finance Act, I introduced tax relief for the fees paid by full-time undergraduate students in publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. However the relief does not apply to courses in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or teacher training. This restriction reflects the provisions in the higher education grant scheme which also does not provide student support grants for these subjects.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act 2000, provides tax relief at the standard rate for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in the EU as well as private colleges in this country. The relief is available for full-time and part-time postgraduate courses. My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Woods, must approve the courses for this relief and I understand that he is considering the question of relief for postgraduate primary teacher training courses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question raises four separate points, which I will answer in turn: The Government provides the premises for the Mount Street crèche free of charge. It also meets the cost of heat, light and the telephone service. Other running costs are met from fees paid by parents. As neither the Government nor the Civil Service crèche co-operative were given full financial information by the previous crèche operator, figures are not available to show the precise value of this subsidy. However, it will be clear that the provision of free premises is, on its own, a very substantial benefit for the crèche given the cost of accommodation in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The funding of the crèche is in line with the policy on work place crèches set out in national agreements. Under this policy, the employer covers the capital costs of the crèche, and, as a result, the fees paid by parents are generally less than those charged in other crèches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mount Street crèche is operated by the Civil Service Crèche Co-operative. The board of the co-operative is made up of representatives of <Col N="1527" /> the main civil service unions. The co-operative decided to engage managers, under licence agreements, to provide child care in Mount Street. The Government has no direct involvement in the actual operation of the crèche. However, in view of the importance of child care provision, my Department and the co-operative have always worked very closely together. This co-operation has been all the greater since the temporary closure of the crèche.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the problems faced by parents as a result of the temporary closure of the crèche. For most parents, the provision of good child care is essential in order to allow them to work. I know that many parents in the crèche have been forced to make other arrangements and that some have had to take special leave. I am determined that this situation will not continue for very long.</P>
    <P>Re-opening the crèche requires two things: (a) engagement by the co-operative of a new manager and (b) the refurbishment and re-equipping of the crèche:</P>
    <P>(a) following its decision not to continue the previous manager's licence, the co-operative sought another manager to operate the creche. A new manager has now been identified. I understand that discussions between the co-operative and the manager are nearly completed. My Department has been kept fully informed about the discussions. I have approved the proposed financial arrangements between the co-operative and the new operator which may involve public funds.</P>
    <P>(b) the Eastern Health Board inspected the Mount Street crèche after its closure. The inspection showed that the premises did not meet mandatory child care standards. I approved a proposal to allow the Office of Public Works to carry out the refurbishment as a matter of urgency. I understand that this work was completed by the contractor last week, allowing the re-equipment of the crèche to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I understand that the co-operative hopes to be able to re-open the crèche very shortly.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy should be aware that my Department and the relevant unions have begun discussions on possible new longer-term management arrangements for the Mount Street crèche and any other civil service crèches which may be opened in future.</P>

However, I am informed that there is currently a backlog of appeals to be dealt with by the board and that this has resulted in delays of over six months between the date of appeal to the board and the offer of an appointment. At present there are approximately 270 persons on the waiting list and this is an indication of the level of demand for tax relief under the scheme as evidenced by the fact that in the first nine months of this year, over 1200 new applicants were admitted to the scheme. I am afraid that there is no obvious solution to the problem which seems to be exacerbated by the fact that many of those who appeal to the board are aware that they do not meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations but still insist on exercising their right of appeal. As the Deputy is aware, an inter-departmental group is currently examining all aspects of the scheme and will furnish a report in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments, including social welfare pensions are, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes. This means that the social welfare pension is combined with any other income a person might have for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>The extent, if any, to which taxation will arise in a given case will essentially depend on the level of other income that a recipient or the recipient's spouse has in the same tax year. If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>
      <P>I draw to the Deputy's attention the fact that prior to the introduction of the new system of PRSI in April 1979, part of the former flat-rate contributions were tax relieved. On the introduction of the new system of PRSI, the tax relief was withdrawn in the 1979 Finance Act. However, in setting the new PRSI rate account was taken of the fact that income tax relief would not be available.</P>
      <P>Those aged 65 and over are treated more favourably under the Irish income tax code than the generality of taxpayers. The last three budgets have implemented substantial improvements in the tax treatment of the elderly, with the exemption limits for those aged 65 and over being increased to £7,500 single/£15,000 married. The age exemption limits compare favourably with the general exemption limits of £4,100 single/£8,200 married. The large increases in income exemption limits for the elderly announced in the 1999 and 2000 budgets will have removed around 25,000 elderly persons from the tax net.</P>

    <P>Where pensioners aged 65 and over are taxed under the normal personal allowance tax system, they are eligible for the special age allowance in addition to the normal personal allowances. The 2000 budget converted this allowance into a standard rated allowance, in line with the standard rating of the main personal and PAYE allowances in the 1999 budget. It also doubled the allowance so that from 6 April this year the age allowance has been increased to £800 <Col N="1531" /> single/£1,600 married, benefiting standard rate taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Elderly people will also have benefited from the general tax improvements introduced in the last three budgets, i.e., the increases in the allowances and bands and the 4% reductions in both the standard and top income tax rates.</P>
    <P>The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states that the Government will continue to review the income tax allowances and exemption limits for those over 65 years with a view to further assisting the position of the aged. I assure the Deputy that the tax position of the elderly will, of course, be borne in mind in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, in last years budget, the basic allowances of a widowed person aged 65 and over totalled £7,500 and the small income exemption limit for the same category of person was also £7,500, implying that there is no extra exemption to small income earnings for such categories; and if an assessment has been carried out of the case for providing some additional exemption for such persons.</Quest>

      <P>Elderly persons who are widowed enjoy a more favourable tax regime than that of elderly single persons. Both receive the general personal and PAYE allowances of £5,700 and also an age allowance of £800. However, elderly widowed persons also receive a widowed allowance which is currently £1,000 and this brings their total personal allowances up to the same level as their exemption limit, i.e. £7,500. In effect, this means that for elderly persons who have income marginally above the limit of £7,500, the widowed elderly taxpayer will end up paying less income tax than a single elderly taxpayer. This is because they will be liable to tax at the standard rate of tax at 22% whereas the income in excess of £7,500 of the elderly person who is not widowed will be liable to tax at the marginal relief rate of tax, i.e., 40%.</P>

      <P>Since 1 July, 1999, a common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and community drugs schemes. In order for any item of medicine to be included in the common list, it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. One of the criteria stipulates that the product should be one which may be used under the supervision of a general medical practitioner and which is not restricted to hospital or medical specialist use.</P>
      <P>An application for the addition of the product referred to by the Deputy to the schemes was examined by my Department and, having noted that the manner of administration of the product was such that it required administration in a hospital or in a specialist clinic associated with a hospital, it was considered that the product should continue to be administered <i>via</i> such hospitals and clinics. Since it has always been the normal practice that medicinal products administered in such a hospital or clinic are supplied by that hospital or clinic, it was considered inappropriate to include this product as a reimbursable medicinal product in any of the community based schemes.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the reimbursement or supply of specialised medicinal products, which are ordinarily hospital-specialist clinic-based products, are under consideration by my Department at present. The arrangements for the reimbursement or supply of this product will be considered in the light of the overall examination.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental services to eligible persons in County Mayo is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. The health board dentist who operated in Killala retired in September 1999 and the board has not yet filled the resultant post.</P>
      <P>The board is currently experiencing difficulty in recruiting dentists to work in geographically remote areas such as Killala. The board is reviewing the situation in light of the restructuring of the health board dental services under which it might be possible to make posts in these areas more attractive by creating promotional outlets.</P>
      <P>Adults who are eligible under the dental treatment services scheme in the Killala area are currently being treated by private dentists under an arrangement with the health board. Children from the area are being treated at the Ballina health centre which was the case prior to the retirement of the dentist in Killala.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board is satisfied that all eligible persons in the region have access to dental services.</P>

The current maximum rate of mobility allowance is £45.60 per month. The rate is increased each year in line with budgetary increases in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that this allowance, among others, is being considered in the context of the following interdepartmental working groups: the review group which is examining the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) scheme, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and the working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which is examining the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment, and chaired by my Department.</P>

Health boards are involved with these grants to the extent that an assessment of the individual case must be carried out by an occupational therapist from the health board, in order for the grant to be approved.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>If people are concerned that they have breast disease and they attend their general practitioner, the general practitioner may refer them to an acute hospital to be assessed. The appropriate further investigation of the patient will be the responsibility of the hospital at this stage and <Col N="1538" /> some patients may be referred for mammography. The Deputy will be aware that a review of the services for symptomatic breast disease was carried out by a sub group of the national cancer forum and I have received its report. I have considered this report, and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. However, some further refinements are needed in implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I established an advisory group, chaired by Prof. Niall O'Higgins, St Vincent's Hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. I am confident the development of symptomatic breast disease services which will result, will greatly enhance the quality of the services currently available.</P>
      <P>In addition to the symptomatic service currently being provided in the acute hospitals, I have recently launched the national breast screening programme, BreastCheck. Phase I of this programme will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 136,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population. The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February, 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion unit. In addition, the first mobile screening commenced on 21 August 2000 in Longford.</P>
      <P>The Health (Provision of Information) Act 1997 facilitated the compilation of a national population register from which BreastCheck invites women in the target age group for screening. General practitioners do not have a role in the referral process. Women who attend for screening under the programme are not liable for any fees or charges.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the continued development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services. In this regard additional funding of £1.6 million in 2000 has been provided to the health boards. Boards have been asked, when developing policy, to concentrate on measures aimed at reducing unwanted pregnancies in the 15-34 age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principles which should underlie such developments are that services should be access<Col N="1539" /> ible to young people and should seek to meet their needs in relation to issues such as confidentiality and hours of operation. Boards' educational/promotional activities should focus on such issues as the need for responsible sexual behaviour of young people at risk, increased awareness of pregnancy counselling services and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity.</P>

      <P>Officials in my Department are currently working on two major pieces of adoption legislation, the Adoption Information Bill, and the Bill to ratify the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.</P>
      <P>Legislation is at an advanced stage in the area of adoption information. Currently access to birth information is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952, although tracing and reunion services are provided on a non-statutory basis by the Adoption Board, the health boards, registered adoption societies and some voluntary groups. This Bill will regulate on a statutory basis search and reunion services and will provide for information rights for adopted people, birth parents and other parties to the adoption. It is also proposed that this Bill will deal with access to records and the care and management of records held by the various agencies. I anticipate having the scheme of a Bill in this area to Government in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland signed the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption in 1996 and work is also at an advanced stage on legislation to ratify the convention. This legislation will involve major and fundamental amendment of our inter-country adoption laws. The primary objectives of the con<Col N="1561" /> vention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interest of the children concerned. A child-centred approach incorporating structures and procedures which accord with good practice in intercountry adoption is being taken into account in the preparation of this legislation. It is proposed that this legislation will deal with the following areas: the establishment of a central authority under the convention &ndash; this authority will co-operate with central authorities in other countries and will be responsible for carrying out or overseeing the procedures for inter-country adoption under the convention. It is proposed that the Adoption Board will be designated as our central authority under the legislation; the establishment of an accreditation system whereby competent bodies can be accredited by the central authority which may provide assessment services or mediation services for prospective adopters; criteria for eligibility to adopt including age limits for people wishing to adopt, and the issue of non-convention adoptions which is not covered by the actual provisions of the Hague Convention. It is not the intention to exclude any countries with which we already have agreements or working arrangements in place which uphold the spirit and principles of the convention.</P>
    <P>Other areas include the preparation/assessment of applicants, the promotion of adoption counselling and post adoption services, the recognition of foreign adoptions, consents and the eligibility of children, the preservation of birth information on the child, appeals procedure and sanctions. I anticipate having the scheme of a Bill in this area to Government early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Both adoption legislation measures will have far reaching consequences in terms of the rights to information and the regulation and funding of the tracing and reunion service and the regulation of inter-country adoption in the best interests of the children concerned. These legislative proposals are still under examination in my Department and final decisions have yet to be taken in relation to both Bills.</P>

      <P>In fulfilment of a commitment in the EU White Paper on Food Safety, the European Commission published a draft directive on the approximation of the laws relating to food supplements in May 2000. To date, there have been three meetings of the EU working party of experts to discuss this draft directive. Officials from my Department, the Permanent Representation and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland have attended these meetings.</P>
      <P>In developing a national position on this draft directive, my Department has met the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board and industry representatives, including the Irish Association of Health Stores. My Department has taken careful note of that association's views relating to the draft directive and the manner in which the upper safe level will be applied in that context.</P>

    <P>I welcome the initiative for a legislative framework on food supplements and consider that the proposal is an overall balanced approach. There <Col N="1565" /> are still some issues in the draft directive that need to be resolved at European level. One of these issues is the procedure for setting of the upper safe levels, in liaison with the EU Commission's Scientific Committee for Food.</P>

      <P>While the regulation of the general insurance industry is primarily a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have responsibility for the regulation of the common good aspects of the private health insurance market. Section 7(2) of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, states that &ldquo;premiums payable under health insurance contracts shall not be varied by reference to &rdquo; ... the suffering or prospective suffering of a person from a chronic disease, illness or medical condition&rdquo;.  Section 8 provides for open enrolment and prohibits insurers terminating or refusing to renew a health insurance contract except in prescribed circumstances. The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which is currently on Second Stage in the House, retains in full the prohibition on taking genetic testing into account in determining health insurance premiums and the relevant open enrolment provisions contained in the 1994 Act.</P>

      <P>The group charged with implementing the recommendations of the report Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures presented me with a report on progress on implementation in July of this year. I am making a copy of this report available to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to bring the Deputy's attention to chapter 6 of the report which highlights that the duration of assessment has already been reduced. Statistics collected from the health boards at the <Col N="1567" /> end of September 2000, indicate that the projected waiting times in some of the boards with the longest waiting times have been reduced in the interim. This is as a result of initiatives taken by the boards in relation to the recruitment of additional social work staff and the efficiencies arising from the introduction of the standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment. In particular, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, whose service for the three area boards is provided by the south-west area health board, has reduced from 36-42 months projected waiting time in June 2000 to 24-36 months in September 2000.</P>
    <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board area the projected waiting time for assessment has reduced from 30 months in June 2000 to 18-20 months in September 2000. In addition, the overall waiting list has reduced from 1,056 at the end of June to 1,002 at the end of September. While this data has not been adjusted to reflect any seasonal variations in the number of applications they seem to indicate that the waiting lists are being shortened and that the excessive waiting times being experienced by applicants in some boards are being reduced. I am satisfied that the initiatives already taken have brought about improvements and that this trend will continue.</P>

      <P>The audiology service has two staff members &ndash; one audiologist and one audiological scientist &ndash; covering the Southern Health Board area. There is increasing demand on the service in this region. To reduce waiting times for treatment, arrangements have been made to contract in sessional staff from the Royal Hospital in Belfast.

These additional clinics will con<Col N="1568" /> tinue until waiting times for treatment are reduced to a satisfactory level.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to recruit audiology staff to the service.

    <P>*Includes 8 places in the new special care unit in Ballydowd which is being opened on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>**Includes 7 places in the Gleann Alainn special care unit which is a regional facility for the southern region including the SHB; SEHB and MWHB and 8 places at the high support Loughmahon Unit which is being opened on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Plans are under way to develop an additional 74 places nationally as follows.</P>
    <P>In the eastern region, the balance of the 16 places in the Ballydowd special care unit will be opened over the next few months. Also the construction of a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane has commenced. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001. These units will operate on a mixed basis.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board, the North Eastern Heath Board, the North Western Heath Board and the Western Heath Board are co-<Col N="1569" /> operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus. This unit will operate as a mixed unit.</P>
    <P>Places being developed in the other boards are as follows: ten high support places, five for girls and five mixed, and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Heath Board which will act as a regional facility for the southern region, ( that is, the SHB, SEHB and MWHB); five high support places for boys in the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>These places are due to become available by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition, two high support places will be opened on a phased basis in the North Eastern Health Board over the next few months.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements for individual children will continue to be provided and this will bring the total number of places available to about 160.</P>
    <P>I should add that it has been agreed that because of pressures on health boards, the special care unit at Ballydowd can be used to accommodate children from outside the ERHA area as an interim measure pending the completion of the national programme of high support and special care units.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the con<Col N="1570" /> sumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 July 1999, the drug payments scheme has been introduced. Under the drug payment scheme a person and his/her dependants will have to pay no more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>

      <P>The provision of medical services at Mayo General Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>At the request of my predecessor, the National Cancer Forum was asked to review symptomatic breast cancer services. A sub-group of the forum carried out this review. The sub-group had the following terms of reference: to assess the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the national breast cancer screening programme; the increase in the target population; the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening; and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening.</P>
      <P>The sub-group was also asked to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services; the resources required to develop these services; and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
      <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought regarding how the service should be developed in their region. In addition, three members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
      <P>The sub-group found that, although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received the report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. No final decisions regarding implementation arrangements at health board level have been taken. I have established an advisory <Col N="1573" /> group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group has recently met Western Health Board officials and clinicians and I understand that, following this, further discussions will take place with the chief executive officer and the Western Health Board following which a definitive plan will be formulated for the treatment of breast cancer in the health board area.</P>

      <P>While there is no grant scheme specifically directed at assisting senior citizens to install central heating in their own homes, there are a number of options available to assist lower income households and elderly persons in particular to secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled person's and essential repairs grant scheme, the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly.</P>
      <P>The grant and loan schemes operated by local authorities are governed by terms and conditions as laid down in statutory regulations. These schemes are designed to give a degree of flexibility to local authorities and it is a matter for the authorities to exercise an appropriate degree of discretion in deciding on individual grant applications.</P>
      <P>The special housing aid for the elderly scheme, operated by the health boards, is governed by guidelines issued by the task force. Under it, necessary basic repairs and improvements are carried out to the houses of elderly persons. In the interests of elderly persons, it has, since its inception, been administered with a minimum of formality and it has been an objective to avoid rigid procedural and other requirements. Works are, in appropriate circumstances, carried out at no cost to the applicant.</P>
      <P>I expect that, where an applicant is not successful in obtaining assistance under a scheme, the other options available would be explored by the relevant authority.</P>
      <P>I have introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant scheme since coming into office. The effective maximum grant available under the disabled persons grant scheme has increased from £8,000 to £14,000 with the grant now covering up to 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds previously. In addition, I have increased the maximum grant available under the essential repairs grant from £1,800 to £6,000. I also allocated record funding of £8 million to the task force on special housing aid for the elderly in 2000. These improvements have allowed local authorities and health boards to extend the type of work that can be undertaken in individual cases, particularly in regard to the provision of heating systems.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the operation of the shared ownership scheme and with the revised income and subsidy limits introduced during the summer. Having said that, my Department has requested authorities to actively promote the scheme and recently reminded them that they should facilitate applicants wishing to purchase apartments.</P>
      <P>The success of the scheme can be seen from the increased activity levels achieved in recent years. In 1998 some 805 transactions were completed under the scheme. In 1999 this rose to 1,314 and indications suggest a further increased level of transactions. The operation and management of the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authority. In operating the scheme, authorities should have regard to local circumstances and, therefore, maximum price limits and other details are best determined by them.</P>
      <P>In the case of Fingal County Council, I understand that a policy decision was taken to limit the maximum price for shared ownership properties to £90,000 with a view to limiting, as far as possible, house price increases. They are keeping this limit under review. I would also point out that that council is currently building houses under the scheme at a number of locations in the county, a number of which have already been sold under this limit.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to modify the scheme at this stage but its operation will continue to be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The Government recently launched a national climate change strategy which provides a framework for achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the most efficient and equitable manner while continuing to support economic growth. It requires action to be taken in all sectors, as early as possible and in a sustainable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the built environment and residential sector, key measures include improved spatial and energy use planning; more efficient new buildings through amendments to the building regulations in 2002 and 2005 to reduce energy use in new housing and an adjustment to be made to the new house grant to encourage energy efficiency; improved efficiency of existing building through education and awareness programmes to promote domestic energy efficiency, changing the fuel mix <Col N="1582" /> in households and energy efficiency rating for housing.</P>
    <P>The significantly increased rate of house building activity, particularly since 1995, and the projected further increase in housing output to 2010, will ensure that a very high proportion of the housing stock will, by that time, meet the higher energy efficiency standards introduced in 1992. By the end of this year, it is estimated that 25% of the housing stock will have been constructed since 1992 and this will rise to over 50% of the housing stock by 2010. Ireland will, therefore, by 2010, have a very modern housing stock constructed to high energy efficiency standards in comparison to other European countries.</P>
    <P>Many effective measures to improve energy efficiency in the pre-1991 stock can be achieved at negative or zero equivalent annual cost to the householder. Educational and awareness programmes being undertaken by the Irish Energy Centre will be intensified to promote these options and to fill the existing information gap for consumers.</P>
    <P>The modernisation of the existing housing stock is also progressed by a number of Government assisted schemes, operated by local authorities and the health boards to improve the housing conditions of those considered most at risk of fuel poverty, local authority tenants and the elderly.</P>
    <P>At present, I have no plans to introduce a grant scheme specifically to retrofit older housing stock.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the reported shortage of planners working with local authorities, he will have examinations made into the work content and practice of such planners to ascertain if some decisions on purely architectural features of applications for domestic dwellings, such as the size and number of windows, colour of materials used and so on, should be exempted form planning requirements as was the case with some boundary walls and house extensions previously; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June this year I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000 which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 square metres to 40 square metres. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas to allow planners to concentrate on forward planning issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the planning system, many minor works to structures are classified as exempted development and do not normally require planning permission. Many classes of development within the <Col N="1583" /> curtilage of a dwelling house are also exempted development, subject to conditions.</P>
    <P>These conditions are provided to ensure that any changes to the development do not result in any injury to the amenities of adjoining properties and are in line with the proper planning and development of the area.</P>
    <P>My objective is an effective planning system that respects the principles of proper planning and sustainable development. I will keep the matter under consideration in the context of the comprehensive review of the exempted development regulations which is currently under way in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the negative effect that the Seveso Directive 2 is having on planning applications in the Cork region due to the preponderance of designated industries located there; if he has satisfied himself with the implementation of the directive since the Health and Safety Authority took over responsibility for it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary objective of the Seveso directive is to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances, and to limit the consequences of such accidents for human beings and the environment. Primary responsibility for transposition of the directive rests with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>The directive requires that appropriate consultation procedures be put in place, to ensure that technical advice is available to planning authorities when planning decisions are being taken in respect of Seveso type establishments and development in the vicinity of such establishments. The Health and Safety Authority, as the central competent authority designate for the purpose of overseeing implementation of the directive in Ireland, has responsibility for providing the necessary advice to planning authorities.</P>
      <P>Pending adoption of the necessary changes to the planning code, my Department wrote to planning authorities in July 1999 urging them to take immediate steps to meet the directive's requirements. In particular, they were advised to take account of the specific requirements in relation to the setting of development objectives in the development plan and also in relation to the processing of planning applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received correspondence on the implications of the directive for the Cork area. I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority is or may be concerned. I am <Col N="1584" /> advised by the HSA that advice provided by the authority in respect of individual planning applications is backed by risk assessment which stands up to international scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The regulations to give statutory effect to the directive's planning requirements will be incorporated in the detailed regulations, currently under preparation, to give effect to the main body of the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make funding available to enable the road access to Fort Villas in Cobh, County Cork, which has been lost due to two landslides, to be restored especially in view of the inability of the emergency services to access the residences; the amount of funding made available to Fort Villas to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Cobh landslide programme involves the provision of financial assistance by my Department to Cobh UDC to undertake remedial works to strengthen areas susceptible to landslips. The criterion for assistance is that works undertaken must be necessary in order to avert danger to the public and, to date, approximately £1.8 million has been expended under the programme on remedial and preventative works at different locations.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions, Cobh UDC has sought funding under the programme for the reinstatement of a private vehicular access to Fort Villas. While some remedial work is required in the area to avert danger to the public, the reinstatement of the vehicular access does not meet the criterion for financial assistance under the programme. Contract documents from the UDC for works involving the stabilisation of an existing masonry wall at Fort Villas are currently awaited in my Department.</P>

      <P>The actual amount of capital expenditure on the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing programme for the period 1997 to 1999 is set out in table 1. The amount shown in respect of the year 2000 is the allocation amount. Actual expenditure under the extensions sub-programme for the period 1997 to 1999 is set out in table 2. The allocation for the year 2000 extensions sub-programme is included with their over<Col N="1585" /> all allocation under the main local authority housing programme and is not separately identifiable at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has encouraged local authorities to avail of both of these schemes as much <Col N="1586" /> as possible and should local authorities require additional funding they have the flexibility to make adjustments within their overall housing capital allocations to cater for any increased demand for these schemes that might arise.</P>

      <P>Statistics on the amount of rent supplement paid and the number of recipients in each health board are presented in the following tabular statement. Details are provided for 1999 and to date in 2000.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on rent supplements was approximately £100.6 million in 1999 and it is expected that expenditure will increase to approximately £118.4 million in 2000. The number of recipients has increased from 41,873 at the end of 1999 to 42,478 at 27 October 2000.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially over the past ten years. In recent years, this has mainly been due to increases in rent levels rather than recipient numbers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312, 313 and 322 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that my Department has received an application from the organisation concerned in relation to the provision of specialist technical assistance for community development projects in areas of rapid urban change under the Department's community development support programmes, CDSPs. My Department already provides considerable support assistance for projects within the programme through the funding of regional-based support agencies and through specialist support agencies.</P>
      <P>This application was referred to the standing operational committee of the community development programme for consideration of additional support structures, including specialist support needs within the Department's programmes. The standing operational committee took the view that before individual proposals to provide technical assistance were considered, a strategic decision was required on whether such technical assistance was an identified need within the programme. The committee intends to revisit this at its next meeting.</P>
      <P>The application from the organisation concerned will therefore be considered when the committee has concluded its deliberations on the matter. My Department will be in touch with the group in due course regarding its application.</P>

      <P>The back-to-education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups, including people who have been unemployed for a certain minimum period, with a view to improving their skills and <Col N="1594" /> qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce.</P>
      <P>To qualify for participation an unemployed person must, <i>inter alia</i>, be pursuing a full-time day course of study at a recognised second or third level institution. In this case, the person concerned is pursuing a part-time course of study and is not eligible for the allowance. Unemployed people who wish to pursue part-time education courses may continue to receive their unemployment payment for the duration of the course. The person concerned is eligible to do this and my Department will be in contact with her shortly regarding the matter.</P>

      <P>Class S contributors are currently covered for old age contributory pension, payable from age of 66, widow's-widower's contributory pension, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, orphan's contributory allowance and bereavement grants. These contributors are not covered for retirement pension which is payable from the age of 65. One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension is that a person must be retired from insurable employment or self-employment. The retirement condition ceases to apply from the age of 66.</P>
      <P>Any consideration of the extension of cover for retirement pension to class S contributors would have to have regard to the financial implications of such a move, the necessity to adjust class S contribution rates to reflect the increase in cover provided and the administrative implications of applying a retirement condition to the self-employed.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to extend cover for retirement pension to class S contributors.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to his recent statement that employment was the solution to high poverty levels, his attention has been drawn to the continuing serious barriers to progressing from welfare to work for many of those who are dependent on rent allowance; and if he will take measures to allow rent assistance as an in-work benefit to ensure that employment is a viable option for persons in these circumstances in view of this poverty trap and the fact that labour shortages are a problem in some areas.</Quest>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full-time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent supplement recipients to retain their rent supplement as an in-work benefit on taking up employment, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, <Col N="1596" /> were reviewed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000. The main objective was to address poverty and employment traps faced by people making the transition from unemployment to work. Following those discussions, substantial improvements in the conditions for the retention of rent or mortgage interest supplement were introduced on 6 April 2000.</P>
    <P>These changes include the abolition of the limit of £250 per month in the amount of supplement that could be retained. That limit was particularly problematic for families which could be paying rent of up to £800 per month. The means test was also eased, with the introduction of a disregard of the back to work allowance &ndash; BTWA &ndash; and family income supplement &ndash; FIS &ndash; in the assessment of means for the £250 gross household income limit. PRSI and any reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test. Furthermore, support is now provided over four years instead of three years and the withdrawal of the supplement is now tapered at the rate of 75% in year one, 50% in year two, and 25% in years three and four, instead of being withdrawn in one step at the end of the third year.</P>
    <P>The additional cost of these improvements amounts to £1.8 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Other improvements were also introduced during 2000. An employment programme for those who were unemployed for five years and over was introduced with effect from 21 August 2000.</P>
    <P>Participants in the scheme will receive an additional payment of £35 per week for up to six weeks compulsory training with an employer followed by an automatic transfer to the back to work scheme when the person takes up regular employment. There will also be two payments of £200 each after the person joins the BTWA programme. All of these payments will be disregarded in the assessment of the £250 income limit for the purposes of rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>I also decided that there is a need to enable and to encourage people to avail of any full-time job that they find without having to go through an employment programme. Therefore, anyone who has been unemployed for 12 months or more and who moves from a welfare payment into a full-time job will be allowed to retain their rent or mortgage interest supplement subject to a weekly gross household income limit of £250 on the same tapered basis as outlined above. This is effective from 28 August 2000.</P>
    <P>Finally, people who take up part-time employment or participate in training courses will have £25 of their earnings disregarded in the assessment of means for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these new initiatives encourage and ease the movement from welfare to work for people who are reliant on rent supplement. They represent a substantial improvement in the scheme and, together with the national minimum wage and other measures, such as family income supplement and back-to-work allowance, they <Col N="1597" /> ensure that all unemployed people who receive rent supplement are substantially better off at work than they would be if they remained on unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>The recently published White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector recognises the need to promote the active involvement of people in community and voluntary groups as an essential component of a democratic society. A range of concerns and interesting proposals regarding recognition and encouragement of volunteering have been put forward in the course of the White Paper consultation process.</P>
      <P>These concerns and proposals will be examined by the national committee on volunteering as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This committee, with participation from all the relevant interests and stakeholders, will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the international year, but for the longer term.</P>
      <P>The national committee on volunteering is currently in the process of being established and an announcement regarding its composition, to include the name of the chairperson, will be made shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A budget of £1 million has been allocated to the workings of the committee and its work will take account of the importance of proactively fostering a culture of support for volunteering. It will also examine and make recommendations on: the <Col N="1598" /> possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer; measures to widen the pool of volunteers; and the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has designated the year 2001 as International Year of the Volunteer &ndash; IYV. It is proposed that the initial function of the national committee be to agree a broad strategy for IYV 2001. The main objectives of the year are the recognition, promotion, facilitation and networking of volunteering contributions world-wide. The international year provides an opportunity to further raise the profile of volunteering in Ireland and progress the Government's policies with regard to the development of social capital and encouragement of voluntarism.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the free fuel allowance has not been increased to keep pace with inflation; if his attention has been drawn to the huge price hike in gas, briquettes and coal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is made to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>The fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and, of course, the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year.</P>
      <P>In that regard, substantial increases were made in all the social welfare primary payments of either £4 or £7 which came into effect at the beginning of May 2000, a month earlier than last year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the qualified adult allowance was increased by amounts ranging from £3.80 for people on disability benefit, £4.70 for old age contributory and retirement pensioners and £8.50 for invalidity pensioners where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the extent to which general price inflation, including fuel price inflation, is impacting on the significant improvements in social welfare payments which I have made. I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but improving the overall position of social welfare <Col N="1599" /> recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided for people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Social security schemes in countries belonging to the European Union &ndash; EU &ndash; or the European economic area &ndash; EEA &ndash; are co-ordinated by Council Regulations (EEC) 1408/71 and 574/72.</P>
      <P>The aim of the regulations is to protect the acquired social security rights of employed and self-employed persons and their families moving within the EU and the EEA.</P>
      <P>A fundamental principle of the regulations is the export of benefits. The regulations provide that invalidity pension, old age contributory pension, widow's and widower's contributory pension and pensions for accidents at work and occupational diseases which have been acquired under the legislation of a member state must be paid to the person concerned even if he or she resides in another member state and cannot be subject to any reduction, withdrawal, modification or suspension. Liability to export other benefits, for example, disability benefit, is more limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who has become entitled to disability benefit may be authorised by the Department to return to the territory of the EEA member state in which he or she is habitually resident or to transfer his or her habitual residence to another member state of the EEA. The authorisation referred to may be refused only if it is established that the movement of the person concerned <Col N="1600" /> would be prejudicial to his state of health or the receipt of medical treatment.</P>
    <P>A person staying in another EEA member state for the purpose of receiving medical treatment which has been authorised in advance of departure by the Department of Health and Children or the health board may also continue to receive disability benefit.</P>
    <P>A person may be paid disability benefit for up to four weeks while on holiday in an EU or EEA member state.</P>
    <P>Non-statutory schemes such as free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free bottled gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and the free television licence are payable to persons in receipt of invalidity pension who are permanently resident in the State. As these benefits apply to services provided within this State and as there are no co-ordinating arrangements under the EU regulations for their provision in other member states, the benefits cannot be provided outside of Ireland. A person who was eligible for these benefits before his departure will resume entitlement on their return to Ireland provided they continue to satisfy the conditions for entitlement.</P>
    <P>With regard to obtaining information on localised benefits in Italy, the INPS &ndash; Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale &ndash; Divizione Generale, Servizio Rapporti e Convenzioni Internazationali, Via della Frezza 17, 1-00100 Roma will be able to assist with information regarding localised benefits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 to 328, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that it is intended to pay another round of compensation, similar to that paid by my Department in December 1999, to those farmers who participated in the compulsory 30% destocking of sheep. It is anticipated that figures as to the amount of compensation payable will be finalised shortly and it is intended that payments will be made around the end of November.</P>
      <P>While final figures are not yet available, it is anticipated that adjustments in the value of premia will, more or less, balance any increase in the market value of sheep. The levels of compensation per head this year will, therefore, be approximately the same as those paid in 1999.</P>
      <P>I am not clear as to what the Deputy means by his reference to &ldquo;all sheep destocked&rdquo;. The compensation payments which have been made by my Department to date are in respect of those farmers in the six western counties of Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Leitrim, Galway and Kerry who took part in the compulsory 30% reduction in sheep numbers.

      <P>Determinations which I make under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, are confined to determining the intrinsic scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest of the building, and do not purport to determine the entitlement of owners-occupiers to claim tax relief under the Act.</P>
      <P>The position is that the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural, or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief for expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>This scheme was first introduced in the Finance Act, 1982, and was superseded by section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. Since its inception a total of 357 determinations have been made.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied with my Department's administration of the scheme, this element of the protection of Ireland's architectural heritage is being reviewed as part of the national heritage plan process initiated by me.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has this year secured additional funding during the duration of the national development plan for the improvement of strategic Gaeltacht roads. As a result it has this year embarked on a seven year plan, the objective of which when completed is having one good road of a suitable standard into every Gaeltacht area. In this context I, together with officials of my Department, have over recent weeks held initial discussions with Cork County Council, and with all the other relevant county councils, in relation to the preparation of a programme of works for the year 2001 and subsequent years for the improvement of these roads. Officials of my Department have subsequently been in contact with officials of Cork County Council and the other county councils in order to finalise proposals which will then be submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department gets advice from the Department of the Environment and Local Government in relation to technical and other aspects of these works.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on capital projects in the built heritage area in the period to 2006 will be £78 million, £65 million on major projects and £13 million to undertake minor works which inevitably arise in a property portfolio of in excess of 740 properties. A list of the major projects I am proposing to undertake in Connacht and Ulster follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to capital projects the other main details of the built heritage elements of the <Col N="1605" /> national development plan I announced on 5 November were as follows: an allocation of £3.5 million to enhance the existing education and visitor services of my Department, this funding to be used to attract additional visitors to less popular sites and to extend the season at as many as possible of the Department's sites; an allocation of £4.5 million in the period to 2006 specifically for a programme of upgrading existing exhibitions and audio visual displays at a number of existing sites; an allocation of £1 million to accelerate the installation of information panels at sites around the country which are popular with visitors but where there is no guide service; an allocation of £1.7 million in the period to 2006 for an extensive apprenticeship programme, primarily in the crucial skills of carpentry, stonecutting and stonemasonary, to commence this initiative I am hopeful that 2001 will see as many as 20 young people commence training in their chosen field.</P>
    <P>While much of the country's heritage not in State care can and will be protected by the Planning and Development Act, 2000, I am anxious that my Department continues to play a proactive role in this area. To this end I announced an allocation of £9.8 million towards what can broadly be described as assisting in the regulation of the built environment. This provision will enable me to accelerate architectural and archaeological surveys so that planners and developers can be better informed before making project decisions. Efforts will also be made to promote the recruitment of archaeologists in planning authorities.</P>
    <P>I believe the strategy I set out on 5 November for the built heritage area in the period to 2006 is comprehensive and wholly realisable and its full implementation will ensure the continued conservation and protection of our national monuments and historic properties in that period.</P>

      <P>I set up the SAC appeals advisory board to consider each landowners objections on scientific grounds to lands being included in special areas of conservation. The board makes a recommendation to me on each such objection or appeal referred to it when the matter cannot be resolved directly between Dúchas and the landowner.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that, at the outset of the appeals process, it issues to the appellant a list of consultants who have agreed to have their names put on a panel for this specific purpose. The appellant is advised that he-she may choose from that list of experts or, if they so wish, engage the services of a suitably qualified person whose name is not on the list. A guideline laid down in the latter situation is that the chosen expert is asked to contact the secretary to the board. This is to ensure that an expert, who has not previously carried out this work on behalf of an appellant, is suitably qualified, fully understands the brief and is in possession of the required grounding documents.</P>
      <P>Before the actual work is commissioned neither the board nor anyone else commits any appellant to using a particular consultant. On the contrary, every effort is made to ensure that the appellant is happy with the expert who is undertaking the case on his-her behalf.</P>
      <P>The board is aware that on a few occasions consultants have disqualified themselves from cases in which they had a previous involvement.

      <P>I do not consider the use of the term &ldquo;saturation point&rdquo; to be appropriate. I recognise that in County Galway, and some other western counties, a relatively high percentage of the land area is included, because of the high ecological quality of these lands.

Bills in preparation: Official Languages Equality Bill &ndash; the general scheme of this Bill is being prepared at present with the intention of circulating it to Departments for their observations by the end of this month. It is hoped to submit the scheme to the Government in January for approval. The Bill would then have to be drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is hoped to publish the Bill by mid-year 2001; Heritage Fund Bill &ndash; drafting of the heads of the Bill is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to have them ready for circulation to other Departments shortly. While it is difficult to give a precise timeframe for the completion of the legislative process in this regard, I am hopeful that the necessary legislation will be finalised early in 2001. Legislative reviews: review of arts legislation &ndash; the review of arts legislation has progressed rapidly with the completion of a public consultation process late last month. Some 230 submissions were received and are being assessed. It is hoped that the draft heads of a new arts Bill will be ready for Government consideration in 2001; review of National Monuments Acts &ndash; the review of the national monuments legislation is well under way and it is envisaged that the draft heads of a Bill will be ready in the first half of 2001.</P>

      <P>As I have already explained in my response on 11 October to Parliamentary Question No. 257, the most immediate priority in the Castletown Estate is the restoration of the house itself, and Connolly's Folly will have to wait until a later stage.</P>
      <P>However, basic improvements, including fencing, have already been undertaken at the folly. A report on the history and condition of the folly was commissioned in 1998, and the situation is monitored on an ongoing basis. The architectural advice available to my Department is that the folly is not under immediate threat.</P>

      <P>The Record of Monuments and Places &ndash; RMP &ndash; completed in 1998, lists approximately 120,000 monuments nationwide. The RMP for each county consists of Ordnance Survey constraint maps with an accompanying index, which shows the locations of monuments and places and a classification for these. The RMPs are publicly exhibited at various locations around each county such as local authority offices, county libraries, farm development services and Teagasc offices.</P>
      <P>The Archaeological Survey of Ireland is involved in recording and interpreting our heritage of archaeological sites and monuments and in making the results available for publication. Sixteen volumes in the series of county inventories have been published to date, covering all or part of counties Carlow, Cavan, Cork, Galway, Laois, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow. These inventories are designed to be of interest to both scholars and general readers.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nationwide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. The Government is committed to completing all interim county surveys within the next two years and the complete national inventory within a period of 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority must, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, histori<Col N="1611" /> cal, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. Under section 4 of the Act, I may recommend to a planning authority that specific structures be included in its record of protected structures. To date, I have recommended that 791 buildings be included in the record of protected structures of a number of planning authorities.</P>
    <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwelling-houses. Part III of the (No. 2) Act provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwelling-houses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 15 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is also no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the (No. 2) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill, introduced as a Private Members' Bill in 1997, proposes, among other matters, a date for the termination of ground rents. The Bill raises constitutional, technical and practical difficulties which cannot be easily overcome. If and <Col N="1615" /> when difficulties of that kind can be met in a way that would substantially improve on the already good and reasonable statutory system that exists for the purchase of ground rent, the necessary legislative details will be announced in the normal way.</P>

The day-to-day deployment of traffic wardens in this region is, therefore, a matter for the Garda Commissioner.

      <P>Basically there are two programmes under the aegis of my Department through which financial assistance is provided for clubs towards the provision of sporting and recreational facilities, <i>viz</i>., the sport capital programme and the young people's facilities and services fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the sport capital programme, from which support was provided for the club a number of years ago in respect of the development of facilities, there is no provision whereby a grant <Col N="1620" /> can be provided in respect of work already completed.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of the young people's facilities and services fund has been on local drugs task force areas where the heroin problem is most acute. In these areas, development groups, comprising representatives from the local drugs task force, local authority and VEC, were established to develop integrated plans on the basis of detailed guidelines approved by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. These plans were considered by the national assessment committee, chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, which evaluated them and made recommendations on their funding to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. All funding earmarked for the local drugs task force areas under the current phase of the fund has been allocated.</P>
    <P>In relation to the eligibility of the club in question for funding under the fund, the national assessment committee agreed in December last, on foot of a request from the development group in Finglas-Cabra, that a proposal submitted by the club at that time would be considered in the event of funding being decommitted from within the existing plan for the area. This would be on the basis that the development group itself prioritised the proposal for funding. This decision was conveyed to the development group at the time. To date, no proposal has been received from the development group for the decommitment of funding from within the existing plan.</P>

      <P>Under the 2000 sports capital programme, 1,650 applications were received in my Department. Following assessment of these applications, grants were allocated to most of the 677 projects in July. The grants to 64 boxing clubs were only recently announced following resolution of outstanding issues between the Irish Sports Council and the Irish Amateur Boxing Association in relation to the council's antidoping programme.</P>
      <P>The guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme require that applicants have, generally, a minimum local contribution of 20% if the project is in a disadvantaged area as is the case in this instance, but normally 30% before an application will be deemed eligible for consideration. When the assessment of the application from the club in question was being carried out by my Department, it transpired that the applicant did not have the minimum level of funding required and it was therefore deemed to be ineligible. The club has been advised accordingly.</P>
      <P>All funds available under the 2000 sports capital programme have now been allocated. However, I am planning to announce details of the 2001 sports capital programme next month and it will be open to the club in question to re-apply if it so wishes.</P>

    <P>At a recent meeting of European Union Sports Ministers in Paris, the Commissioner responsible for sport, Mrs. Reding, provided an update on the matter. She informed Ministers that the Commission is considering the UEFA response and will be in contact with the football authorities and representatives of the players during the course of this process. The Commission has indicated its wish that any changes to the international transfer system arising from this review will be for the good of the sport generally and that an equitable balance will be achieved between the rights of the players and of the clubs, bearing in mind, in particular, the welfare of young players. I look forward to the Commission and the football sector reaching a mutually acceptable arrangement along these lines, and I will be making that point <Col N="1622" /> to the Commission and to the Sports Ministers in the coming months.</P>

It has also been agreed to transfer responsibility for the regulation of the superannuation arrangements of clerical, administrative and ancillary staff in IOTs, and vocational education committees, from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to my Department.

      <P>Officials of my Department have ongoing and regular contact with all survivors' groups. Most recently an official of my Department met with all the survivors' groups based in Ireland, Alliance, Right of Place, ORIA, Aislinn, Right of Peace, JIFA, Irish SOCA, last Thursday, 9 November. My Department is currently, with the Department of Health and Children, putting in place arrangements to establish a national office to support the victims of childhood abuse to, <i>inter alia</i>, access the commission to inquire into child abuse, and act as a referral service for such victims to other State services. The purpose of this meeting was to provide an opportunity for the groups concerned to participate in the development of the office and, in particular, to ensure that the services of the office would be both appropriate and meaningful for victims of abuse.</P>
      <P>My Department has also written to Irish SOCA, and other survivors' groups, inviting them to submit such views as they may have on the Government decision in principle to provide for compensation for those persons who suffered abuse in childhood in residential institutions for which the State had a regulatory or supervisory function. It is my belief that this process of compensation must take account of the views of survivors of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of commitments to Irish SOCA which have not been honoured. However, in general, my approach to the serious and important issues arising in regard to survivors of abuse is to, at all times, listen to the views of survivors themselves and take their views into account in making any decisions on matters affecting them. <Col N="1624" /> Officials of my Department are and have been available to meet any group of victims which wishes to put its views forward.</P>

      <Quest>the measures that have been taken to ensure that children leaving primary education in the catchment area for Castleknock community college, Dublin 15 will be guaranteed a place in the school in September 2001 and subsequent years.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties arising at present due to the lack of places in Castleknock community college are being addressed as a matter of urgency by my Department.</P>
      <P>The position in the Dublin 15 area generally is quite complex because, while some schools in the area are full to capacity, others are in a position to offer places. My Department has maintained regular contact with all of the schools concerned since earlier this year to determine how the anticipated difficulty in September 2001 can be averted and to secure agreement on a cooperative enrolment process in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, I am not aware that any pupil from Dublin 15 seeking a place in a post-primary school in the area for next September has failed to do so. I can confirm, also, following discussions <Col N="1625" /> between the schools and my Department, that co-operative enrolment arrangements will be in place for 2002 and subsequent years. As part of these arrangements, every effort will be made to accommodate pupils in their local school. However, no guarantees can be given in that regard. The objective will be to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that the existing schools can, between them, cater for demand within the area generally.</P>
    <P>I am aware, also, that the level of housing development in Dublin 15 is such that further educational provision at first and second level will be required. Again, my Department is addressing this issue as a matter of priority in consultation with Fingal County Council.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, 1992-99, to enable me to establish a sworn public inquiry, nor do I have the power generally to establish such an inquiry.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, matters relating to examinations are clearly a statutory function of the managements and governing bodies of the institutes of technology. In this regard, it is my understanding that the director of the institute is seeking to appoint a reputable and independent third party to hold an inquiry and to report on this matter. I also understand that the staff directly connected with the matter have agreed to co-operate with this approach, with the exception of two persons, and that the college authorities are continuing to seek a resolution of this situation in advance of initiating the proposed inquiry.</P>
      <P>Given the statutory role and functions of the management and governing body, I believe that the matter can and should be resolved locally.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The board of management and the director of Trinity House school are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school and for ensuring best practice in relation to cigarette smoking by young people and that relevant legislation in this regard is complied with. Most young people admitted to Trinity House school have been smoking cigarettes for a number of years and consequently are already addicted to nicotine by the time they arrive at the school. The school's policy in this regard is to educate and support the boys to stop smoking. In cases where children do not succeed in giving up the habit, cigarettes are given to the children concerned to be smoked in a restricted way within the school. Young people who do not smoke in Trinity House or who give up smoking are rewarded positively. Cigarettes are not sold to the young people in Trinity House school, nor are they given as a means or method of reward.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of months, management has been reviewing smoking policies and practices with a view to making the school a smoke free area and my Department is monitoring progress in this matter. I am satisfied that the school management is fully aware of its responsibilities in relation to the need to curb cigarette smoking by young people in its care.</P>

In some instances the provision of part-time teaching hours can be adequate.</P>

      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has a statutory function under the Education Act, 1998, to advise me on all aspects of the curriculum and, accordingly, I have asked the council to undertake a review of the programme, including the views of teachers, parents and young persons participating in the programme. I have indicated that, in undertaking this review, the council should have regard to best practice in this and other countries, to the implications of current relevant policy and legislation in this area and the issues raised in the current public debate.</P>

      <Quest>if he will increase third level grants for students attending colleges in Northern Ireland or Great Britain as charges are in sterling in view of the significant difference in value between the pound sterling and the punt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> Minister for Education and Science </P>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): Since 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants for undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In this context, and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his-her course.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1996, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continued to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
    <P>In December last, in response to a number of representations, local authorities and vocational education committees were advised that grant-holders should be given the option of having their grant paid either in Irish punts or in the currency of the country in which they are studying. This concession allows students studying in Northern Ireland or the UK to receive their grants in Irish punts rather than sterling, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>My Department is satisfied that the current arrangements are equitable and efficient. While the current exchange rate difficulties with sterling are appreciated, my Department is not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom. Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

      <Quest>if consideration has been given to the provision of classes for the deaf and the teaching of the ISL sign language in schools even on a pilot basis; if he has considered the difficulties that deaf children have in integrating into a normal society and the problems that non-hard of hearing or non-deaf children have in attempting to communicate with children who have a hearing difficulty or who are deaf; if he will give consideration to this concept; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently two special schools and 14 special classes for hearing impaired pupils. All these facilities operate at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 7:1.</P>
      <P>Children who are deaf or who have hearing impairment are not a homogenous group either in terms of their hearing loss or of a wide range of other key factors. Therefore, no single response is appropriate or adequate when addressing the communication needs of this particular category of children. Educational provision is made for the individual child, in consultation with their parents, on the basis of the assessed needs of each child.</P>
      <P>In this context, and in relation to the choice of communications system, the fundamental decision is whether the most appropriate first language for the child is Irish sign language or spoken English. If the option is for spoken English, which it will be in a significant number of cases, then a predominantly oral method of teaching is employed. In this oral approach, signed English is sometimes also used as a teaching device.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the option is for Irish sign language, then the child is taught in a linguistic environment that is predominantly or exclusively based on the use of <Col N="1633" /> Irish sign language. There is a growing request for this approach by some parents on behalf of their children. The policy of my Department is to facilitate access to this approach so that the assessed needs of pupils and parental wishes are taken into account.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have allocated additional resources to the two special schools in Dublin to allow them to establish a number of classes in which sign language is the medium of communication and teaching. Special needs assistants, who are proficient in sign language, have also been provided for these schools in order to facilitate the development and use of Irish sign language as required. My Department has also provided support for a number of families with deaf children to allow them to employ tutors of Irish sign language in their homes.</P>
    <P>With regard to further developments in this area, my Department will continue its consultations with representatives of the deaf community and with other relevant bodies and individuals, including individual parents of deaf children. The increased use of Irish sign language in the education of deaf children has also been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are also being made to establish a representative advisory committee which will offer guidance on key future developments in the education of the deaf, including the issues raised by the Deputy in relation to Irish sign language and communication with non-deaf children.</P>
