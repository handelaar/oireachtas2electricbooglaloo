      <P>I wish to have the business of the House suspended under Standing Order 31 to debate an issue of urgent public importance, the revelation that vaccines were tested on children in care in the 1960s and 1970s without the consent of parents or guardians which may have left some of the children susceptible to serious illness.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil decided to vote against the Private Members' Bill on joyriding last night, much to the discomfort of many Government backbenchers. Will the Taoiseach indicate when No. 67 on the legislative list, the criminal justice Garda SMI Bill, will be brought forward so the issues that were discussed and agreed upon last night can be debated with a view to improving the services of the Garda Síochána for communities which, notwithstanding the views of the Minister for Finance, have miserable lives due to the Government's incompetence?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>What about the report on the use of vaccines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report by the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children into the vaccine trials in the 1960s and 1970s is in final draft stage. Discussions are ongoing between the Department and the office of the Attorney General regarding the arrangements for the report's publication. Counsel has advised that draft copies of the report should be sent on a confidential basis to the Eastern Health Board, Southern Health Board, Glaxo and Professor Irene Hillery for observations on the contents prior to its publication. That is because people are mentioned in the report.</P>
      <P>The draft report will be sent to the office of the Attorney General by the end of this week. When cleared by the Attorney General it is intended to issue the report to the people I mentioned and they will be given time to respond. The Minister has no difficulty with the report being debated in the House in due course. Legally, we must go through due process because people are mentioned by name in the report. That process would have to take place by resolution of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach think the report will be published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General's involvement should be finished this week. Since people are named, the report must be given to them. One would have to give them a reasonable period although it should not be more than a few weeks. The Minister was anxious to discuss the report in the House next week but legally he cannot do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been written about in the newspapers. Somebody has the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach order an investigation into the leaking of the report? The voluntary organisations have been waiting three years for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are now looking for the report. It is causing serious concern to parents of vaccine damaged children. They are concerned that somebody has leaked the report's contents without them getting sight of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the tolerance the Chair has shown the House on this issue. It is because of the leak that the normal procedure outlined by the Taoiseach must be accelerated. Given that 19 Bills were promised during this session and so far <Col N="992" /> only five have been published &ndash; we are very close to the Easter recess &ndash;  is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Government system of legislation formulation, drafting and publication is meeting its own targets because there seems to be quite a degree of slippage? This is a legislative House and there is much talent in it. Last night the Government voted down a Bill which could easily have been amended on Second Stage. Proper laws, which our community needs, could be put on the Statute Book. The system is not working at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn knows that in the past 12 months a record number of Bills have gone through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A record number of delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, the Finance Bill, the Social Welfare Bill, the Planning and Development Bill and the National Minimum Wage Bill have gone through the House, all of which are extremely important. By the end of this session, 14 of the 19 Bills will be published, so that is an enormous amount of work.</P>
      <P>In reply to the question about times, I have seen the leaks in the newspapers and the Minister is very conscious of them. The advice from the Attorney General's office is publication in the Dáil, maybe by way of one of the following three options. First, presentation of the report to the Dáil to avail of whatever level of qualified privilege attaches to such a course. We would have to take account of that and it would need to be discussed by the Whips. Second, to publish the report by way of a Dáil resolution to attract Article 15.12 privilege. Third, to send the report to the Oireachtas Committee in order to avail of privilege under section 22 of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privilege and Procedure) Act, 1976. Before we do that, we would have to get to the stage where we finish the process but we will do that as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the same issue &ndash; this report. Although the Taoiseach has dealt with the matter, in the context of his response, it is of the greatest importance for the children and parents of these children that there is no delay. Is the report, as reported, in a first draft stage? Is the Taoiseach in a position to tell the House when it will be finalised because that is not clear from what he said? There is great public interest in this report being fully available and not leaked in stages and in the Government indicating what actions it will take on foot of the report.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach had any report on last night's bomb in Northern Ireland? Does he have anything to tell the House? Has he concerns about it and does he know who might have set off the bomb?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I received reports of an explosion at the perimeter fence of Ebrington Barracks in the Waterside area of Derry. The explosion took place at around 6.30 a.m. this morning. Thankfully, there are no reports of casualties. We have raised the matter with the British authorities through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and have sought further details of the explosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no details about who was involved but I suspect &ndash; there have been a number of events recently &ndash; it is dissident republican groups, <Col N="995" /> particularly in that area. It is very close to where the Ballykelly explosion took place some weeks ago. Needless to say, I take the opportunity to unreservedly condemn the futile and criminal bomb attack on the barracks this morning, which is also an attack on peace. Such actions are anti-republican and they will not overturn the democratic will of the people. I restate that the two Governments, all the pro-agreement parties and the parties in this House are determined to make sure such acts do not stop our efforts but, if anything, strengthen the efforts to try to find a resolution to the present difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the bomb in question further underlines the absolute urgency of all-party talks being convened as soon as possible to break the impasse in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement? When will this House debate the Health Insurance Bill which is to give effect to the proposals in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance? It is one of the Bills due to be published in this session.</P>

      <P>Is the Government concerned about fulfilling the conditions of the Kyoto Agreement? Is the Taoiseach aware of the alarming report yesterday about the depletion of the ozone layer and our commitments to stop producing carbon gases? There was an announcement last week that we are to build two more power generating plants burning fossil fuels. That is in total contradiction to the agreement. What are we doing to play our part? This is also a major health matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mental Health Bill, 1999 is significant legislation. Its purpose is twofold. First, it will provide a modern framework within which people who are mentally disordered and who need treatment or protection, either in their own interest or in the interest of others, can be cared for and treated. The Bill will bring our legislation on the detention of mentally disordered patients into conformity with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
      <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to put in place mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment in our mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated. The vehicle for achieving this will be the Mental Health Commission to be established under the Bill. The commission's primary function will be to promote and foster high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services. The existing office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be replaced with the office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, who will be employed by the commission. Both the commission and the inspector will operate independently of the Minister for Health and Children and of the Department. This independent status will be crucial in driving the agenda for change and modernisation in the mental health services in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of new mental health legislation is an important milestone in how we care for people with a mental illness in a modern Ireland. Since the mid-1980s we have seen the development of an integrated and community-based <Col N="998" /> approach to the care of the mentally ill. I have no doubt that the quality of care for persons with a mental illness has been enhanced by this development. These advances in management and treatment allow many people with mental illness to live normal lives and to continue to contribute to our society in a positive and fruitful way. Alongside the development of more effective treatment techniques, there is a need for change in the statutory safeguards for those considered to be in need of care in an in-patient setting. Since the 19th century, powers have existed in law to protect people with mental disorders from the consequences of their behaviour and, more particularly, from abuse and exploitation in society.</P>
    <P>The current criteria under which mentally disordered people may be detained involuntarily are set out in the 1945 Mental Treatment Act, which was last amended in 1961. It provides the statutory framework for the detention of people with mental disorder and for the administration of the psychiatric services. The Act was innovative in the mid-1940s, and its principles have been described as enlightened for its time. However, successive Governments have acknowledged that this legislation is in need of substantial reform to bring it into line with current thinking and international norms on the detention and treatment of people with mental disorder.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is a culmination of a long and detailed process of consultation and careful consideration. In 1992 the then Government published the Green Paper on Mental Health. Part one of the Green Paper set out the fundamental objectives of policy on the care of the mentally ill which have been adopted by successive Governments since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984. Briefly, these objectives are: to provide a comprehensive and community oriented psychiatric service; to integrate psychiatric services with general hospital, general practitioner, community care and voluntary services; to improve the standard of care in psychiatric hospitals pending the transfer of services to alternative locations in general hospitals and in the community; and to improve services to meet the special needs of particular target groups, such as the elderly mentally ill, persons with an intellectual disability in psychiatric hospitals and children and adolescents with psychiatric problems. Part two of the Green Paper set out the reasons new mental health legislation was needed.</P>
    <P>Comments were invited on the Green Paper, particularly in relation to the proposals for new legislation. The response was excellent with more than 100 submissions received from a wide range of professions, interested parties and individuals. There was unanimous endorsement of the principles of a modern psychiatric service as outlined in Planning for the Future. Nearly all the respondents also commented on the issues to be addressed in new mental health legislation.</P>
    <P>Subsequently in 1993, following receipt of the majority of submissions, the Mental Health <Col N="999" /> Association of Ireland held a public seminar on the theme, A Mental Treatment Act &ndash; Towards a Consensus. The seminar provided a further opportunity to discuss the main issues in new mental health legislation, to place proposed Irish developments in an international context and to exchange views. There was a broad representation of interested bodies in attendance: Departments, health boards, the voluntary mental health movement, the voluntary intellectual disability sector, professional associations and others. The submissions and the seminar showed that there was a large measure of agreement with the proposals for new mental health legislation outlined in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>This consultative process was followed by the publication in 1995 of a White Paper entitled A New Mental Health Act. Its purpose was to define more precisely the content of the new mental health legislation in the light of responses to the Green Paper, the best interests of the mentally disordered and our international commitments. It also provided a further opportunity for interested parties to examine proposed legislative provisions before the preparation of legislation.</P>
    <P>The response and reaction to the Government's proposals was of enormous benefit in preparing this new Bill and I thank those who contributed to the process. There were differences of opinion on some issues at times, but overall there was a large measure of agreement on the proposals. It is heartening to realise that, despite some of the negative perceptions which are sometimes held about people with mental illness, it is evident that, ultimately, there is a deep concern about their welfare as they are among the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>At the core of the Bill is the need to address the civil and human rights of persons receiving care and treatment in our psychiatric services. The Bill focuses on: improving and modernising the criteria and mechanisms for the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment; establishing a system of automatic and independent review of all detentions, including the provision of legal aid to all those who are detained; and putting in place a framework by which the standards of care and treatment provided in our in-patient mental health facilities can be supervised and regulated.</P>
    <P>Central to meeting these objectives will be the establishment of the Mental Health Commission. The Mental Health Commission will have responsibility for promoting and fostering high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and with ensuring that the interests of detained persons are protected. Its range of functions and responsibilities is far wider than that proposed in the White Paper for the Mental Health Review Board. Furthermore, it will be an independent body entirely separate from the Department of Health and Children and the health boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> The commission's main functions will include promoting and encouraging the maintenance of high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services, arranging for an independent review by a mental health tribunal of all decisions to detain a patient on an involuntary basis and each decision to extend the duration of such detentions, the establishment and administration of a legal aid scheme for detained persons, the maintenance of a register of approved centres in which hospitals or residential facilities providing psychiatric care and treatment must be registered and the appointment of the Inspector of Mental Health Services.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the commission will have ten members, including a practising barrister or solicitor, two registered medical practitioners of which one will be a consultant psychiatrist, two representatives of the nursing profession, a social worker, a psychologist, members of the general public and two representatives of voluntary bodies promoting the interests of people suffering from mental illness. The inclusion of these professions and groups will provide the commission with a range of knowledge and a balance of views on issues that affect our mental health service. The work of the commission will be greatly enhanced by this diversity of disciplines.</P>
    <P>A key provision of the Bill is that each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a person involuntarily for psychiatric care and treatment will be reviewed. The review will be independent, automatic and must be completed, except in certain circumstances, within 28 days of a person's detention. The process will be put in train immediately on a person's admission. All patients will have a right to review, even if they are discharged before 28 days, and section 27 of the Bill provides that they must be so informed when they are being discharged. Reviews will be carried out by one or more mental health tribunals, consisting of a consultant psychiatrist and a legal assessor and operating under the aegis of the Mental Health Commission. As part of the review process, the mental health tribunal will arrange, on behalf of the detained person, for an independent assessment by a consultant psychiatrist.</P>
    <P>The review I am proposing in the Bill will be substantive and will focus on two issues, whether the person concerned is mentally disordered and whether the correct procedures were carried out in detaining him or her. A tribunal will be empowered to order the release of a patient if it considers that he or she does not require to be detained involuntarily.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to clarify a number of points in relation to this review. Some commentators have referred to the fact that the White Paper proposed a review of detention after seven days and have suggested that what is contained in the Bill offers less protection to involuntary patients than was promised in the White Paper. This is incorrect.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposed that a procedural review of the legality of a person's detention <Col N="1001" /> would take place within seven days of involuntary detention. The type of review envisaged then would have been a paper exercise, simply checking that all the correct procedures had been carried out. It would not have touched on the crucial question which must arise in all cases of involuntary detention, that is whether the person is mentally disordered to the extent that it warrants a restriction on his or her liberty. The White Paper did not consider that the type of fundamental, clinical review which is proposed in the Bill was necessary until a person had been detained continuously for over a year. The proposal in the White Paper does not go far enough to ensure the rights and interests of the detained person are protected. My proposal for a substantive review within 28 days represents a major advance on that put forward in the 1995 White Paper.</P>
    <P>This Bill also includes important provisions regarding the right of the patient to receive information concerning his or her detention. Section 15 requires that when a person is involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care and treatment, the consultant psychiatrist who makes the decision to admit is obliged to inform the person of his or her legal rights. This includes informing the patient of his or her right to be legally represented in any proceedings in relation to his or her review, or at appeals against a decision of the review tribunal. When people are being discharged, they are entitled, under the Bill, to be informed of their right to have their detention reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Bill also obliges the Mental Health Commission to make arrangements for the granting of legal aid to patients. The precise details regarding the operation of this legal aid scheme must be agreed with the Minister and the Minister for Finance. It is my firm belief that the provisions of the Bill lay the foundations for achieving a sustained improvement in the quality of care provided in mental health services. In 1998, there were almost 26,000 admissions to psychiatric hospitals and acute psychiatric units. Approximately 6,000 of these were first time admissions. Approximately 23,500, or 90% of all admissions, were voluntary admissions. This leaves a balance of 2,500, or about 10% of admissions, which were involuntary. It is expected that with the introduction of new mental health legislation and more stringent procedures for involuntary detention, the number of involuntary admissions will decline.</P>
    <P>The overall number of in-patients in psychiatric hospitals and in acute psychiatric units continues to decline and stood at 5,101 at the end of 1998. The proportion of patients being admitted to general hospital psychiatric units, as opposed to the old style psychiatric hospitals, is increasing and in 1998 accounted for approximately one third of all admissions.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance to help service providers to achieve high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services. The Mental Health Commission and the Inspector of Mental Health Services will play a pivotal role in this regard. The current Inspector of Men<Col N="1002" /> tal Hospitals has already begun this process. A document entitled Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice and Quality Assurance in Mental Health Services was prepared by the current inspector and published by my Department in 1998. The guidelines are an educational endeavour to increase awareness of the main quality issues in service delivery and their monitoring, refinement and improvement. They have been circulated to mental health professionals and service providers around the country. I anticipate that similar guidelines and other measures will be developed by the new commission to assist service providers in their pursuit of excellence in care delivery.</P>
    <P>The new Mental Health Bill will also have major implications for the role of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. The present inspector plays a crucial role in providing independent and detailed analysis of mental health services. The inspectorate has provided expertise and assistance in identifying problems and outlining the need for improvements in mental health services. Under the provisions of this Bill, the existing Office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be replaced by the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, thus giving the new inspector a much broader remit than that of the current incumbent. The inspector will be employed by the Mental Health Commission and will have complete independence from the Minister and the Department. This represents a major improvement on the proposal in the White Paper that the office of the inspector be associated with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In addition to the annual inspections of in-patient facilities which are carried out at present, the new Bill will require the inspector to carry out an annual review of all mental health services, including community residences and day centres as well as acute in-patient facilities. The inspector's review of the services, including reports of inspections carried out, will be published along with the Mental Health Commission's annual report and will be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another important responsibility of the inspector will be in relation to the regulation of standards in mental health services. A register of approved centres, in which each hospital or in-patient facility providing psychiatric care and treatment must be registered, will be maintained by the Mental Health Commission. Regulations will be made specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres, including requirements in relation to food and accommodation, care and welfare of patients, suitability of staff and the keeping of records. The execution and enforcement of these regulations will be the responsibility of the Inspector of Mental Health Services.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses the need to provide safeguards for patients in relation to consent to treatment. The Mental Health Act, 1945, and subsequent amending legislation, does not cover the issue of informed consent to treatment given by a detained patient. However, as referred to in <Col N="1003" /> the Green Paper, it has been widely assumed that if a person was involuntarily detained in a psychiatric hospital his or her consent to treatment was not required. Concern about the rights of mentally disordered patients has led to a questioning of this assumption. In response to this concern, Part IV of the Bill clarifies, for the first time in Irish law, the obligations of mental health professionals regarding consent and brings our legislation in this area into conformity with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing mental health services is to provide all in-patients with a good quality alternative to care in large psychiatric institutions. Unfortunately, the rate of progress in providing this alternative service has fallen behind. It has to be acknowledged that mental health services have frequently lost out to other services which have been given priority in the allocation of development funding. If we are to sustain and develop the concept of a comprehensive psychiatric service located in the community close to where people live and work, it is important that adequate funding and support is provided to the service providers. I recognise that much needs to be done in this regard. It is my intention as Minister to facilitate health boards as far as possible in bringing about the necessary improvements and developments.</P>
    <P>It is time to make a concerted effort to tackle in a determined and comprehensive manner the problems in our mental health services. To this end, an additional £12.2 million has been allocated to the mental health service this year. This represents an increase of more than 100% on the additional funding provided in 1999.</P>
    <P>The provision of capital funding is also essential if mental health services are to be transformed in the way we would all wish to see. Substantial capital funding under the national development plan will go towards the development of mental health facilities. Approximately £150 million will be provided over the lifetime of the plan for mental health services. A significant part of this funding will go towards the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals. These units will replace services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 17 acute units already in place, a number of units are currently at various stages of development including the Mercy Hospital, Cork, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Ennis General Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and at Nenagh, Portlaoise, Castlebar and Sligo General Hospitals. A further four acute psychiatric units are under consideration as part of the national development plan. These will be located at Dundalk, Wexford, Mallow and Mullingar.</P>
    <P>At the end of the period of the national development plan in 2006, it is my intention to <Col N="1004" /> make substantial progress on completing the programme of acute psychiatric units. This will mean that acute admissions to the old psychiatric hospitals will become a thing of the past. I will also provide funding under the NDP for more community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences, thus further accelerating the phasing out of the old mental institutions.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, this Bill improves on the proposals which were put forward in the 1995 White Paper in a number of significant respects. I acknowledge, however, that a number of other issues raised by the White Paper are absent from the Bill. The necessity to provide urgently for a reform of our legislation regarding involuntary detention, in order to bring this country into line with the European Convention on Human Rights, has resulted in my bringing forward a Bill which is shorter than originally envisaged. I am aware that this has caused some disappointment among those with an interest in the mental health services and I assure the House that these issues have not been overlooked or forgotten.</P>
    <P>The issues discussed in the White Paper which have not been included in the Bill are ones which require further detailed consideration by my Department and discussions with other Departments and agencies. It is my intention, when this Bill has been enacted, to ensure that these outstanding issues are addressed by my Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I urge the House when examining this Bill to bear in mind that legislation is not the only means by which to effect change in the health service. The most acute problem for the mental health services for many years has been inadequate resources and, as I indicated earlier, I am taking steps to ensure that the position is improved on that front.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with the important issue of the civil and human rights of those who are involuntarily detained for psychiatric care and treatment. As a group, these people are among the most vulnerable in our society. They are often unable to speak for themselves.  It is incumbent on us as a society to recognise our obligations in relation to these people and I am pleased to be able to introduce this Bill which will ensure that we will now adhere to the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would take issue with those who assert that this Bill does no more than the minimum required to bring us into line with the European Convention on Human Rights. In many respects, it goes further that what was proposed in the White Paper. Crucially, it provides for the establishment of the mental health commission which will have the capacity, as an independent body, to drive the agenda in relation to modernising our mental health services. I am confident that the commission, as proposed in this Bill, in conjunction with the enhanced inspectorate, will enable us to develop in the years ahead <Col N="1005" /> a mental health service which is in keeping with the needs and requirements of a modern society.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is regrettable, however, that crucial issues which should have been addressed in it have been omitted. It is a long awaited Bill which has had an extraordinarily lengthy gestation period. The Minister referred to the deliberations which have taken place and the reports which have been published in the last ten years. The Green Paper was published in June 1992 and the White Paper in 1995. It should not have taken five years from the date of publication of the White Paper to develop legislation to reform an Act from 1945.</P>
      <P>There are certain areas which the Bill addresses in principle and I welcome that, although I will comment on the manner in which they are addressed today and on Committee Stage. The new procedures for involuntary detention and the automatic, independent review of initial decisions for involuntary admissions which will be undertaken by the new mental health tribunal are welcome. The establishment of a mental health commission with a remit to supervise the delivery of all mental health services and ensure proper standards are attained and maintained is also welcome. The replacement of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, who has done a good job, particularly in his most recent report, with an inspectorate of mental health services, which has a broader remit, is also a step in the right direction. The establishment of a register of approved centres and their regulation is a move forward in principle. There are aspects of the legislation, however, which need to be amended.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not regulate mental health services in the comprehensive manner in which they should be regulated nor does it extend the provisions and protections for those who suffer mental illness. It is essentially a Bill about the involuntary care of those who require psychiatric treatment. In essence, this is an involuntary care Bill with some add on provisions. It addresses the position of the 10% who are admitted involuntarily every year but not the 90% who are voluntary psychiatric patients.</P>
      <P>The Bill misses the opportunity to address the totality of the psychiatric service in the context of the obligations of the State and the prescription of patients' rights. A psychiatric patients' charter is required but the Bill does not provide for it. There is a need to prescribe statutory criteria to ensure consent to treatment is properly given by voluntary patients and that consent is fully informed and freely given. That is not addressed in the Bill. It simply assumes that a certain percentage will be admitted involuntarily and it prescribes the procedures which apply to them. There is a concern that, on occasion, people are admitted as voluntary patients without giving fully informed consent to the treatment they are about to undertake or to their stay in hospital. The Bill should address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> The scandalous and appalling conditions tolerated for too long in our mental hospitals should be at the centre of this debate. The 1998 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals is an indictment of our mental health services. Hospital conditions and the standard of psychiatric treatment administered to patients are severely criticised. The report states that drug prescribing in some locations is often arbitrary and made without regard to appropriate clinical diagnosis and that the number of patients, particularly long stay patients, who are on numerous drugs simultaneously, often at high dosages, is striking. In some instances prescriptions had not been reviewed for some considerable time. The report goes on to say that the inspectorate feels that in some services, the practice of consultants in regard to medical note taking falls short of what might be considered good professional practice.</P>
    <P>The facilities in which we treat those who require psychiatric care must be dragged out of the 19th century into the 21st century. That is happening in some places &ndash; the Minister referred to some of the development work under way &ndash; but it is not happening in other parts of the State. Progress in St. Ita's is far too slow and the conditions in the Central Mental Hospital, Dublin, bear relation to the structural conditions of institutions of that nature in the 19th century.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the Bill and the powers it confers on the mental health commission and the inspectorate of mental health services will prove to be a positive catalyst for changing this. The necessary investment required for this area of the health service must be provided to demonstrate for the first time that it is regarded as a priority.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing, however, that those in prison who require psychiatric care are excluded from the Bill's concerns. That is yet another example of the piecemeal nature in which mental health services are addressed in the Bill. Some areas are picked out to be addressed through legislation while others are totally ignored, abandoned or postponed.</P>
    <P>I do not buy the argument that the areas not covered in the Bill which are addressed in the White Paper will be addressed in the foreseeable future. We have waited 55 years for the reform of the 1945 Act. It has taken three years for this Government to produce this Bill, which was first promised over a year ago. I have no faith that issues omitted from the Bill will be returned to in the lifetime of this Government. The Minister must look at the areas addressed in the White Paper. In the interests of those who require psychiatric care or who are availing of mental health services, this Bill affords an opportunity to address issues which are currently being overlooked.</P>
    <P>Regarding admitting prisoners who require psychiatric care, for years the Mountjoy visiting committee has complained about psychiatric conditions at the prison. In 1997, the visiting committee said the standard and quality of the psychi<Col N="1007" /> atric services continued to cause it grave concern. A psychiatrist did not visit the main prison during several weeks in 1997. The committee quoted Dr. Smith, Director of the Central Mental Hospital, as saying that at least 100 prisoners in Mountjoy should be in a psychiatric institution and not in prison. In 1996 the visiting committee reported that incarceration in padded cells for up to ten days was the only option available for the treatment of these prisoners. It again quoted Dr. Smith as saying the padded cell is a grotesque way of storing a human being. In 1998, the visiting committee said it was dissatisfied that people with obvious psychiatric problems are being committed to prison. The question must be asked why this area remains unaddressed. It is omitted from the Bill because of demarcation lines between the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and as a result we cannot comprehensively address the issues that have been ignored for too many years.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Bill to address the needs of mentally disordered offenders appears to breach the United Nations resolution on standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners adopted on 30 August 1955 and the European prison rules contained in Recommendation No. R873 of the Committee of Ministers, Council of Europe 1987. Chapter 7 of the White Paper envisages that this legislation will address the needs of offenders. There is no valid reason for it not doing so. New legislation will not of itself result in a fundamental reform of our psychiatric services and tackle the fundamental discrimination suffered by psychiatric patients. We have grossly inadequate hospital and residential facilities and an absence of community supports. Emphasis has been placed on people who suffer psychiatric illness not being confined within institutions and hospitals but being treated within the communities in which they live and remaining part of those communities, yet we have failed abysmally to ensure essential community supports are available to make this a beneficial option for those who live in the community. We need significant additional funding, current and capital, and a change of attitude to prioritise the needs of the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>The national task force on suicide emphasised the need for an extensive network of community based psychiatric services with specialist and multi-disciplinary teams being brought within reach and accessible to all who require such a service. There is an essential need for funding and manpower resources and I am not satisfied that to date the Government has remotely addressed this issue. It is only now starting to examine it. The gaps in services remain very wide. There is a need for vision and commitment as to the type of service that should be in place, which is sadly lacking, and for a dynamic to ensure it is put in place without undue delay in the context of the resources available to us as a community, which <Col N="1008" /> we heard the Minister for Finance celebrate in a champagne interview on RTE this morning.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with or prescribe the rules and obligations of health boards. There is a need to prescribe minimum standards for psychiatric treatment, including the provision to be made for those with learning difficulties, and there is a need to impose particular obligations on health boards to meet the needs of those who are psychiatrically unwell. The services in each health board area are different. They are diffuse, fragmented, unco-ordinated and the level of service one gets depends largely on one's location and the health board area within which one lives.</P>
    <P>The central issue of inadequate funding for essential services is adequately illustrated by the position of young women who suffer from anorexia outside Dublin. Such young women may be kept alive in hospitals, but they will not get the comprehensive service required to overcome their illnesses. If a young Dublin woman who suffers from anorexia requires care, she may access and benefit from the required service. Six out of eight health boards have no facilities to deal with children with psychiatric illness. If a child requires care in those health board areas, there is nowhere for him or her to go except to an adult centre where adults with psychiatric problems are treated. This is inappropriate and damaging. In the context of a plethora of court cases involving young people who are disturbed or need psychiatric care, the courts have been forced to place them in inappropriate institutions. The Government has been consistently condemned in the courts for its failure to put in place coherent care policies and ensure that essential residential units are available so that such children receive the treatment to which they are entitled. Health boards should have a statutory obligation to promote good mental health and to provide a comprehensive after care service and community care programme for voluntary and involuntary patients after their hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Mental Health details the requirements of new legislation and, in doing so, deals with the areas the Minister omitted. I referred to the position of offenders. Chapter 8 of the White Paper proposes that provision be made for adult care orders to provide protection, where required, for mentally disordered adults living within the community. The emphasis in recent years on community care and the reduction in the use of institutional care has shone the spotlight on the need to ensure appropriate care and protection for those vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and neglect. There is also a need to make legislative provision for our community care services and to guarantee a right to psychiatric and other support services to those in the community reliant on care.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain why the proposal for adult care orders contained in the White Paper is not addressed in the Bill and why the recommendations are being completely ignored. Where a patient suffers from dementia, there is a <Col N="1009" /> need for an adult care order facility to be available to ensure that where that person lives within the community, there is an identified person with responsibility for his or her daily care. Addressing the issue of adult care orders is not complex legislatively. It would not be a difficult issue to address in the Bill. It does not require complex drafting by the parliamentary draftsman because, in the context of general family law legislation, there are adequate precedents that can be adapted to facilitate a comprehensive system of adult care orders to ensure the care of people within the community who require to be under the care of others but who do not require institutional care.</P>
    <P>The rationale for not addressing this issue escapes me. There is only one reason this issue has not been addressed. After three years of prevarication the Government was finally forced to produce a Bill because it is being pursued by the European Court for a violation of an individual's rights in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as a result of its failure to put in place some of the protections for involuntary admissions provided for in the Bill. That is why the main focus of this Bill is unfortunately on involuntary admissions. It also deals with some other aspects that need to be addressed and omits important areas such as the care order area in the context of people living within the community, particularly the adult care order area. It omits those aspects for no reason other than the work and preparation had not been done properly over the period of the Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise some issues with the Minister, which we will address in more detail on Committee Stage, in the hope that he will take on board some of these proposals and that they will not be issues of contention across party lines on Committee Stage. At the core of the Bill are the provisions which enable the involuntary admission of a patient suffering from what the Bill refers to as a mental disorder. Section 3 states that a mental disorder means mental illness, severe dementia or significant mental handicap. Mental handicap as a term is incorrect and not acceptable under the current international classification of diseases. The term &ldquo;significant mental handicap&rdquo; should be renamed as &ldquo;significant mental impairment&rdquo; or &ldquo;significant intellectual disability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The use of the phrase &ldquo;mental handicap&rdquo; is no longer correct.</P>
    <P>Section 7 prescribes the criteria for involuntary admission to approved centres. Section 7(2) reads, &ldquo;Nothing in <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be construed as authorising the involuntary admission of a person to an approved centre by reason only of the fact that the person (f2&gt;a) is suffering from a personality disorder, (f2&gt;b) is socially deviant, or (f2&gt;c) is addicted to drugs or intoxicants.&rdquo;  The Bill does not define what is meant by &ldquo;personality disorder&rdquo; or &ldquo;social deviance&rdquo;. It should do so because there can be great dispute at the edges as to whether someone is suffering from a person<Col N="1010" /> ality disorder or a psychiatric illness. There is a need for the Bill to provide clarity in this area as to the distinction it is making.</P>
    <P>In the context of mental health, it is right that the Bill excludes involuntary admissions on the sole ground of addiction to drugs or intoxicants. However, it must be asked whether the legislation should make provision for involuntary admissions where the sole problem is drugs or intoxicants and where, as a consequence of the use of such drugs or intoxicants, someone is clearly incapable of caring for himself or herself and is posing a serious risk to themselves and to others. There is a need to consider this issue either in the context of this Bill or other legislation.</P>
    <P>Regarding those who can make application to have someone involuntarily admitted, section 3 provides for the exclusion of certain spouses from that category. The provisions do not deal adequately with this area. The White Paper states that in circumstances where spouses are in contention and there are marital differences between them, each spouse should be able to apply for an involuntary admission. The provision in the Bill which deals with spouses is extremely narrow. It excludes the spouse from making application for involuntary admission of the other spouse in circumstances where the couple are already separated or where a barring order has been sought or granted under domestic violence legislation. The White Paper states that &ldquo;The Government propose in new legislation to disqualify a spouse from making application for the detention of his or her partner where the couple has separated or is in the process of separating or where an order has been sought.&rdquo; for what would be either a barring order or a protection order.</P>
    <P>In the context of marriage breakdown, there are many other circumstances where it is appropriate that spouses be excluded. The Bill, as currently constituted, does not even meet the criteria of the White Paper. Clearly one spouse should not be able to apply for the involuntary admission of another where judicial separation proceedings or divorce proceedings are taking place or where proceedings have been issued over the custody of children pursuant to the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964. As a lawyer who has practised in the area of family law for 25 years, I have had the experience in custody disputes between spouses over children where one or other spouse falsely alleged that the spouse with whom they are in dispute is suffering from a psychiatric illness and should be detained in a psychiatric hospital. I have had experience where husbands &ndash; it seems to be primarily something husbands do &ndash; have asked their GPs to have their wives committed under the Mental Treatment Acts. Some cases have gone to court where wives alleged they were wrongly admitted as involuntary patients at the behest of husbands approaching GPs who were unaware of the marital situation and who are led to believe they were acting properly in supporting such an application under the Mental Treatment Acts. This is not unusual because every year I <Col N="1011" /> would have two or three family law disputes going through my law firm where this type of difficulty arises and false allegations of psychiatric illness are made.</P>
    <P>The Minister should treat with great caution the circumstance in which a spouse is excluded from making an application for involuntary admission. This is not adequately dealt with in the Bill. This does not mean there may never be circumstances where marriages have broken down and where one spouse has a psychiatric illness and requires an involuntary admission. However, others can make that application under the legislation and this is not properly addressed. This should also extend to circumstances where couples are in contention in nullity proceedings. Bearing in mind the large numbers of couples cohabiting outside marriage, the Minister should consider whether there are circumstances in which exclusions should apply to cohabitees.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to authorised officers and the role of the authorised officer in the context of the authorised officer making application for an involuntary admission. It defines an authorised officer as an officer of some particular grade within the health board. If authorised officers of a health board are to be able to apply for involuntary admissions, the Bill should specify the qualifications of authorised officers. It should not simply be a matter of their grading within a health board. Under section 11 a garda may apply to have someone involuntarily admitted. However, where it is clear an involuntary admission may be required a garda is only given a discretion to take action. Under the section, the garda should be obliged to take such action.</P>
    <P>On the removal of persons to approved centres, there is the question of who should effect the removal. In this context, in circumstances where a removal is required and the family cannot do it, a fully qualified psychiatric social worker should be attached to multi-disciplinary units within approved centres who would have a particular role in the removal of patients.</P>
    <P>On the duration of detention, the provision for initial admission of 28 days is too long. This period should be seven days, with a possible extension to 14 days and thereafter to 28 days. Where it appears the admissions must be for a particular period, for example, if the Minister adheres to 28 days or three months, whatever period is ultimately chosen, it should be for periods not exceeding those periods. If, for argument sake, the Minister decides to retain the 28 day admission, it should be possible for a psychiatrist making these decisions to determine that he could detain someone for a period not exceeding 28 days, that it would be an involuntary admission for just seven or 14 days and that at the end of each period there would be a review, not just in the context of the mental health tribunal but an internal hospital review.</P>
    <P>On appeals to the courts, the Minister should look again at the Circuit Court procedure. If <Col N="1012" /> there is an appeal to the Circuit Court, the onus is on the patient to prove he or she is not suffering from a mental disorder. The onus is not on the hospital, health board or psychiatrist to establish the patient involuntarily admitted has a mental disorder. The concept of proving to the court that one does not have a mental disorder is very strange.</P>
    <P>I do not know how one can do that. If there is an appeal to the Circuit Court, the onus should be on the psychiatrist to show that a patient suffers from a mental disorder if a detention is to continue. Schizophrenia Ireland is concerned about this area and that the review of a detention order will only take place after 28 days.</P>
    <P>The issue of children is not adequately addressed. Court orders for detention of children should not be for definitive periods. For example where they can be detained for three or 12 months it should be for periods not exceeding three months or 12 months. In the context of the provisions relating to children, will the Minister clarify how this Bill will interact with section 16 of the Children Bill, 1999? Why does he envisage an initial court procedure, under the Mental Health Bill, and in the context of the Children Bill, 1999, which deals with children who suffer particular difficulties and require particular types of care, there is first a need for a family welfare conference? Why is there not a similar approach in the two Bills? Why is it that a family welfare conference is to be called for children who suffer such personal difficulties as to require detention in a secure unit, but if a child suffers from a mental disorder a family welfare conference is not first called but one goes to the courts? There is no clarity as to what type of psychiatric examination will take place prior to the court application being made. Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the child is entitled to independent representation and to the appointment also of a guardian<i> ad litem. </i>That should apply in the context of applications to have children admitted as involuntary patients under the Mental Health Bill.</P>
    <P>A large number of other issues need to be addressed. I shall draw to the Minister's attention on Committee Stage other substantial amendments which I regard as necessary if the Bill is to work. For example, in the context of the mental health commission there is provision for only two medical practitioners on it, a GP and a psychiatrist. I would argue that there should be at least two psychiatrists and two GPs on the commission. The mental health tribunal should have a lay representative. Under the Bill it will have a psychiatrist, a legally qualified person and no lay adviser. I do not know how that tribunal will make decisions. That needs to be clarified. Is the legal adviser part of the decision making process or will that person advise the psychiatrist? Either way, the tribunal should reflect the structure proposed in the White Paper. It should be a three person tribunal with a lawyer, a psychiatrist and a lay person manning the tribunal.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcomes the Bill. However, it is limited in its scope and does not address fully the complex issues surrounding mental health and the care of the psychiatrically ill. For that reason it is a disappointment. It is telling that the Bill is introduced at a time when industrial action is being taken by psychiatric nurses over matters outstanding from the nurses strike last year. The delay in producing the Bill and its narrow focus are indicative of the fact that the malaise that has gripped our psychiatric services for many years has not gone away completely. However, one must acknowledge progress that has been made, particularly improvements in therapeutic drugs and treatments and new approaches in care. These changes have not been reflected in legislative change. The present law dates back to 1945. At the time I have no doubt it was a progressive framework within which services could be delivered. Today we operate in a different context. The development of human rights legislation and developments in health care and best practice principles all require a new legislative framework. Sadly the Bill only provides for part of that.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as the Minister said, does not deal with many of the issues relating to mental health. Problems in the area of mental health have been compounded by serious under-funding as well as the failure to address serious defects in mental institutions. The psychiatric services have always been the poor relation of the health service. When it came to apportioning resources, caring for the mentally ill came low on the list of priorities. Historically, the neglect and lack of innovation surrounding mental illness could have been explained by ignorance and fear. The shift from institutional to community care was one important change but even that was not properly resourced. Today we have no excuse either in terms of lack of knowledge or lack of money. Yet in many ways we are still silent and neglectful at worst and ambivalent at best about the psychiatrically ill. As a society we have been quick to look the other way when the vulnerable have suffered, whether children in industrial schools, women in the Magdalen laundries or the psychiatrically ill in our State institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the most striking example of our failure to face up to the needs of the mentally ill is St. Ita's institution at Portrane. For many years the inmates there suffered in silence. For many years reports were not produced or published by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals on this or any other hospital so that the conditions in St. Ita's and other institutions were hidden from scrutiny. It took brave people such as Annie Ryan to stand up and fight for the rights of those who are unable to speak for themselves. The world she <Col N="1014" /> revealed to us was truly grim. It is a tribute to her and the commitment of others like her that much is being done to improve conditions and to ensure good quality accommodation. It reflects well on no Government that it took so long to start to put things right. We cannot be complacent. We should not fool ourselves that everything has been put right.</P>
    <P>The long delay in publishing the 1998 inspector's report only served to increase unease about its contents. It highlights a range of serious issues that require our attention. The inspector states that drug prescribing in some locations is often arbitrary and made without regard to appropriate clinical diagnosis. The number of patients, particularly long stay patients, who are on numerous drugs simultaneously, often at high dosages, was striking. In some instances, prescriptions had not been reviewed for a lengthy period. The practice of consultancy in regard to medical note taking, the basics of good medical practice, also came in for criticism as falling below proper professional practice. The carrying out of clinical drug trials &ndash; a relevant issue in terms of what we read in the newspapers &ndash; without patient permission is also highlighted. There were other matters in the report relating to the lack of privacy and dignity and those in need of geriatric care being placed in psychiatric hospitals because there was no appropriate accommodation for them. There are descriptions of accommodation that do not belong to this era &ndash; old Victorian institutions, unsuitable, overcrowded. It is not the good quality accommodation we expect and which these people deserve.</P>
    <P>The issues relating to mental health are complex. The Bill concentrates on a particular aspect. In the White Paper there is an acknowledgment, at the end of paragraph 6 of the introduction, that it is only concerned with the Mental Health Act to give greater protection to the civil rights of the small number of people with mental illness who have been detained. Notwithstanding that, the White Paper goes on to say that this should be seen as one of the measures being taken to reform the mental health services. The Council for Civil Liberties has outlined the central issues that need to be addressed <i>in toto</i>, the adequate protection of detention and review of detention, proper provision for voluntary patients, proper criteria for detention and assessment of patients, specific duties to be placed on hospitals in relation to patient care, an independent body to examine conditions in hospitals, protection of the capacity of patients in the right to consent, advocacy for patients and patients' rights, effective monitoring of treatment including the use of drugs, provision of after-care and of anti-discrimination measures. I would add to that list, a specified role for health boards and the right of access to treatment for patients who need it.</P>
    <P>Measured against such a yardstick, it is clear that while the reform of legislation is welcome, it does not go far enough. Any changes in law which we bring about now will last for many years so <Col N="1015" /> we must achieve a mental health regime which not only matches best practice but stands the test of time. We must go beyond best practice. What is needed is the updating of the law and a programme of expenditure to improve conditions in psychiatric institutions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of additional money and I give credit for the improved funding provided by the Department. However, it is not sufficient to overcome the problems which exist. We need to take an integrated approach, particularly in the provision of after-care for the mentally ill. All too often, this is not evident and people suffer as a result. We need to change our attitude towards the mentally ill. Most people who are mentally ill are temporarily incapacitated. The length of stays in hospital denotes this fact with 20% of patients being discharged within one week and 73% within one month.</P>
    <P>Those who require long stays in hospital have particular needs and concerns which must be addressed. The inspector's report indicates poor conditions in long stay hospitals. A parliamentary question of mine elicited information about the reality of long stay patients which I found disturbing. One patient had been locked away for 64 years and 70 people had been detained for more than 30 years. Those patients were incarcerated in very different times and without the safeguards which are being applied in this Bill. Some of the reasons for which those people were incarcerated are excluded from the terms of this Bill. These include alcoholism and personality disorder. I am sure many of these patients could have lived outside institutions, and lived much happier lives.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party welcomes the establishment of the Mental Health Commission to oversee the standards of psychiatric institutions. The idea of an independent commission is a good and sound one but the commission must be properly funded and resourced. It must also be careful to win the confidence of both patients and staff. Difficulties may arise in the future with regard to the roles of the inspector of mental hospitals and of the commission. The commission will appoint the inspector but there appears to be an overlap which requires clarification.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a review tribunal is also welcome. However, we must recognise the flaw which has been referred to by Deputy Shatter. By far the greatest number of involuntary patients are released within a month, which renders the 28 day review practically useless. The White Paper proposed a review after seven days. I accept the Minister's point that this does not compare like with like, but the principle of a seven day time frame has been established and the Minister should incorporate it into the Bill. If we introduce a Bill which does not make a significant change in the terms of protection of those it is intended to protect, we are in danger of window dressing.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the composition of the commission. The White Paper allowed for lay involvement but this has been excised in the Bill. <Col N="1016" /> To have legal and medical representation alone reduces the value of the commission. George Bernard Shaw maintained that all professions are conspiracies against the laity. It is not the role of politicians to perpetuate the power of the professions but to challenge it and to recognise the contribution of lay people. I urge the Minister not to become part of this potential conspiracy. If it is not challenged it will be perpetuated. The Courts Service is an example of how to do things right. The fact that lay people who are outside the judiciary participate in the new structures running our courts has improved the capability of the Courts Service in ways that would not have been dreamt of in the past. The Minister should move with the times and recognise the contribution of lay people. The lay perspective, the importance of which even professionals recognise, will be missing from the commission and from the decision making table.</P>
    <P>The White Paper pointed out that new legislation offered an opportunity for the development of psychiatric services as recommended in Planning for the Future. However, we are only talking about involuntary admissions, which account for approximately 10% of psychiatric patients. We are not simply enacting a new law. We are also repealing the bulk of existing legislation. I am concerned about the rights of those who are admitted to psychiatric hospitals on a voluntary basis. The nature of voluntary admissions in certain circumstances has been questioned in the past. There should be checks to ensure that admissions are fully voluntary. We hear of patients who are told that if they do not admit themselves voluntarily another method will be used. The Bill contains no requirement to ensure that a person is competent to admit himself or herself on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The voluntary detention of children is seen as the sole domain of their parents. The health board becomes involved only upon parental failure to act. The Bill refers to children as being aged 18 and under, which seems to conflict with other legislation which defines children as aged 16 and under. The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, for example, designates 16 as the age of consent. It is also possible that the Bill does not comply with the UN convention on the rights of the child, which Ireland has ratified.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the position of the health boards under the new regime. Under current legislation, health boards are obliged to provide psychiatric care and in-patient services for people with mental illness. The White Paper proposed that a statutory duty be placed on health boards to promote mental health and to provide an appropriate range of services. The White Paper goes on to say, &ldquo;A legal framework which reflects the new developments in the psychiatric service would give the service a secure foundation and assist in further development&rdquo;. However, no such provision is outlined in the Bill and I would like to hear the Minister clarify the responsibility of health boards. Will health boards <Col N="1017" /> have a statutory responsibility for the care of psychiatric patients when this legislation is enacted and is that responsibility for in-patient care only?</P>
    <P>The evidence of inappropriate placement or homelessness, where there is no placement at all, of patients who leave in-patient care cannot be ignored. It is estimated that between 30% and 45% of people who are homeless suffer or have suffered from psychiatric illness. Not long ago, the Eastern Health Board was able to say that none of the handful of people who were then homeless suffered from psychiatric illness. It may be that we know more now, or it may be that the situation has changed. Nevertheless, it is deeply worrying that such a large cohort of the homeless population is vulnerable and in need of medical attention. There is concern in relation to the provision for those who voluntarily commit to hospital.</P>
    <P>The White Paper states that the Government proposes to define approved centres for the purposes of involuntary admission and that all centres which admit or detain patients will be approved by the Minister. There is a difference in the Bill under which the Minister is not the person who will approve centres. Neither does it confine approved centres to the list of seven contained in the White Paper. The commission will issue approval. Any person who makes an application cannot be refused approval unless the premises do not comply with the regulations provided for in section 65. I am always uneasy about a Bill the implementation of a large bulk of which is dependent on the production of regulations with which we will not have an opportunity to deal in detail. In this instance the regulations are crucial and we do not know when they will be published or what they will contain. A package of legislation is being repealed. There will therefore be an interregnum period while the commission is being established and the regulations are being prepared. How does the Minister see the system operating in the interim?</P>
    <P>I am greatly concerned at the exclusion of certain categories from the definition of mental illness. I do not disagree with the principle but those suffering from personality disorders, social deviance or addicted to drugs and intoxicants are excluded. What provision is being made for these categories? What alternative arrangements are being made for them in terms of care and treatment? Under existing legislation persons suffering from these conditions can and are admitted to psychiatric hospitals. There are numerous examples where such patients were subsequently found to have underlying and predisposing psychoses, obsessive or depressive illness to which the condition was a secondary reaction. Does this exclusion extend to patients presenting voluntarily for admission suffering from any of the conditions mentioned?</P>
    <P>While the principle is a good one &ndash; that we ensure those ending up in psychiatric hospitals <Col N="1018" /> are psychiatrically ill &ndash; the Minister still has a duty of care to those excluded from the definition. As we are all aware if one has money one can access care in in-patient and out-patient facilities, whether it be St. Patrick's Hospital or St. John of God in the Dublin region or Ais Eirí. If an alcoholic in my constituency is found out of control and very disturbed and in need of in-patient detox treatment the only place to which he or she can go is Newcastle psychiatric hospital. This will not be permitted under the Bill. If a local family doctor is called out and has to cope with a problem such as this do I telephone the Minister? What happens in those circumstances? There is an unevenness in care. In Dublin facilities are and should be developed outside the psychiatric service.</P>
    <P>There will be a requirement to make the full range of needed services available in each health board region, including child and adolescent services and eating disorder programmes. There is a tendency to believe that because a service is being developed in the capital, a need is being met but those who do not represent a Dublin constituency will be conscious of the unevenness in care. Patients have a right to access quality services on an equal basis. This right should be supported by legislation.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;term&rdquo; personality disorder and social deviance is used in the Bill but not defined. This may cause problems in terms of clarity.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific issues which I will raise on Committee Stage but there are one or two serious omissions. It is reckoned that about 30% of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison have a psychiatric disorder or are psychiatrically ill. One per cent of the prison budget is spent on medical care. This compares with a figure of 6% in England and Wales and 9% in Scotland. It is shockingly low. I am not satisfied that responsibility for the health care of prisoners is being retained under the authority of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It should be a matter for the Minister for Health and Children. Not alone are we not providing for the psychiatric needs of those in prison we are not ensuring that those who are psychiatrically ill are kept out of prison when they appear before the courts. I will be extremely disappointed if the Minister does not deal with this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are a large number of issues to which I will return on Committee Stage to which I look forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for sharing some of her precious time with me. I am my party's spokesperson on equality issues. Although I have the same reservations as the two previous speakers in what it fails to deal with, I welcome the Bill which has finally been introduced. There have been many welcome changes during the years in relation to the numbers detained in large psychiatric hospitals and the way people can be detained. We should pay trib<Col N="1019" /> ute to those who have campaigned on the issue. I single out, in paticular, Annie Ryan who with the help of others has campaigned strongly on behalf of those with a mental handicap or an intellectual disability detained in psychiatric hospitals. While this has resulted in many changes being introduced, more remains to be achieved.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on the 500 people with a mental handicap or an intellectual disability still being cared for in psychiatric hospitals. This figure was provided by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, Dr. Dermot Walsh, when he addressed the Association of Health Boards last week on the Bill. As Deputy McManus said, the definition of mental disorder needs to be teased out. It extends to a significant mental handicap. What are the Minister's intentions with regard to the 500 people who are being inappropriately detained in psychiatric hospitals? What provision will be made for them, although I acknowledge that there have been significant changes over a number of years in this regard?</P>
      <P>The other area on which I wish to concentrate is people who may be inappropriately detained, for example, people who have suffered head injuries and, what is loosely termed, the young chronically ill. I am aware of people in psychiatric hospitals who have head injuries or other such conditions which do not come within the definition of mental disorder in the Bill. They often do not get appropriate care, such as the various therapies they need. What are the Minister's intentions with regard to such people who are detained in psychiatric hospitals?</P>
      <P>I welcome the human rights element of the Bill where people will be entitled to independent review and also that people can only be involuntarily detained in limited circumstances. This aspect has been of concern for a long time because people's human rights were not being looked after in this regard. Individuals could be detained for long periods without any access to a second opinion or an independent hearing with regard to why they were detained in the first place. Such people were often neglected over the years by family and the State.</P>
      <P>The overall thrust of the Bill is important but I hope the Minister will respond to the issues outlined by myself, Deputy Shatter and Deputy McManus. The groundbreaking report, Planning for the Future, in 1984 identified a number of areas which are not covered in the Bill. In some ways, the legislation is relatively narrow in terms of what it attempts to address. However, the debate it will bring about in terms of our general approach to mental health will be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus touched on the concern in relation to the number of homeless people who have psychiatric illnesses. While it has been good to bring people out of large institutions, this may have resulted in problems with regard to how people are treated and supported in the community. Much still needs to be done in that regard. More support services are needed for <Col N="1020" /> people in the community, particularly those who spent many years in a psychiatric hospital. As the equality spokesperson for my party, my concern is that the Minister would address the question of people with intellectual disabilities who are still inappropriately detained in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the balance in the Bill in favour of a person's individual rights at all times and in all situations. The main points of the Bill are that there will be one detention order, automatic judicial review, recourse to court approval, informed consent, no drug trial, independent review, no legal formalities for admission and discharge of voluntary patients and approved centres will be registered. In addition, the dreaded PUM &ndash; person of unsound mind &ndash; system, under which one could be indefinitely detained without automatic review, will be extinct.</P>
      <P>The work of the tribunal may appear formidable but in my constituency, Cork North-Central, the north Lee catchment area serves a population of 118,400. In 1997 there were 880 admissions and 896 discharges. A total of 119 of the admissions were on temporary orders under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and only six persons had their temporary orders extended. The vast majority of admissions were voluntary. Regarding community services in the same area in 1997, 438 out-patient clinics were held at eight locations. A total of 1,294 patients attended these services while 263 were attending for the first time. One can understand the comparison and the importance of services in the community.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new Mental Health Bill, the object of which is to reform existing legislation concerning the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment, to provide for automatic independent review of each decision to detain and to establish mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment provided in psychiatric in-patient facilities can be supervised and regulated. However, the Bill is just one of the measures being taken to reform the mental health services.</P>
      <P>In 1981 the then Minister for Health, Eileen Desmond, appointed a study group which was to examine components, both institutional and community, of the psychiatric services, to assess the existing services and to draw up planning guidelines for the future development of the services. Its document, Planning for the Future, was published in 1984. The main thrust of the report was for a radical shift in the pattern of care of psychiatric patients, particularly in the areas of finance and resources, from an institutional to a community based service with close links between psychiatry and other community services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study group recommended a programme to implement its recommendations in all parts of the country. This programme was to be initiated without delay so that mentally ill persons could benefit from an effective and progressive service. To facilitate a community based psychiatric service and to provide particularly for the care of <Col N="1021" /> detained persons in such a service, new mental health legislation was essential.</P>
    <P>Our Lady's Hospital, situated in my constituency, Cork North-Central, was the second largest psychiatric hospital in the country. It once housed 2,500 patients and, thankfully, it is now closed. The 16 remaining long stay patients and the intensive care patients are currently housed in St. Kevin's unit, which is situated in the grounds of Our Lady's Hospital. There are plans to transfer these patients elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Our Lady's Hospital was a landmark outside the western boundary of the city, overlooking the River Lee. It was a place of sadness because of the stigma associated with mental institutions for those who had relatives or friends detained there. We all remember families dumping people in institutions in previous decades. In response to Planning for the Future, a skilfully designed deinstitutionalisation programme was put in place for the patients. This resulted in patients being transferred to community based or specialised services.</P>
    <P>Community based rehabilitation programmes must be continued to prevent psychiatric patients from developing institutional neuroses which occurred because of the negative environment that existed in the asylums of the past. A new Mental Health Act to provide for the care and treatment of psychiatric patients in the future is therefore essential.</P>
    <P>During my research for this Bill, I considered the historical backdrop to the Mental Treatment Act, 1945. I examined the Vagrancy Acts, 1714 and 1744, which provided for the civil committal of the mentally disordered and created classes of &ldquo;furiously mad&rdquo; or &ldquo;dangerous persons&rdquo; who could be committed by two or more justices of the peace to places of detention. It was not necessary for them to be charged with any crime before committal.</P>
    <P>The segregation of the mentally disordered from society has been termed the &ldquo;great confinement&rdquo;. This was achieved through the construction of institutions or asylums for the detention of the mentally disordered. Ireland's first asylum, St. Patrick's Hospital, Dublin, founded by Jonathan Swift, was opened in 1757. The Dangerous Lunatics Acts, 1800, 1838 and 1867, provided specifically for the detention of the mentally disordered. These laws remained in force until the enactment of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, which established the legal mechanism used today for the civil law committal of the mentally disordered. The White Paper is concerned with a new Mental Treatment Act but it should be seen, as I mentioned, as just one of the measures being taken to reform the mental health services.</P>
    <P>The proposed new mental health legislation places emphasis on the protection of civil rights of the relatively small number of people with a mental illness who have to be detained for treatment to bring our legislation into line with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Green Paper pointed out that the criteria for <Col N="1022" /> detention and the safeguards against improper detention did not conform to those required by this country's international commitments. These relate principally to the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom, 1950 to which Ireland is a signatory.</P>
    <P>There are six parts to the Bill which is designed to reform existing legislation, repeal the part of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 concerning the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment, provide for automatic independent review of each decision to detain and establish a mechanism by which the standards of care and treatment provided in psychiatric facilities can be supervised and regulated. The main features of the Bill provide for an independent agency to be known as the Mental Health Commission. One of the main functions of this body will be to ensure the interests of detained patients are protected. Each decision to detain a patient on an involuntary basis and each decision to extend the period of detention will be referred to the commission which will arrange for an independent review of all such decisions to detain to one or more mental health tribunals. In turn, these tribunals will arrange on behalf of the detained person an independent assessment by a consultant psychiatrist. The tribunals will be empowered to order the release of a patient if they consider that he or she does not require to be involuntarily detained. I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes new requirements in respect of obtaining the consent of detained patients for certain types of treatment, for example, electro-convulsive therapy. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be replaced by the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services. The inspector's annual report will be published in conjunction with the commission's annual report and the commission will retain a register of approved centres in which psychiatric in-patients are treated.</P>
    <P>Under the new criteria for involuntary admission, a person may be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre if he or she is suffering from a mental disorder, if, because of that disorder, there is a serious likelihood of that person causing an immediate or imminent harm to himself or herself or to other persons or if, in the case of a person whose mental disorder is severe and where judgment is impaired, failure to admit or detain that person is likely to lead to a serious deterioration in his or her condition or will prevent the provision of appropriate treatment that can be given only by admission to an approved centre.</P>
    <P>A mental disorder is defined in the legislation as mental illness, significant mental handicap or severe dementia. The following will be excluded from the definition of mental disorder: personality disorders, social deviance, addiction to drugs or alcohol and perverted conduct. The detention of persons with a mental disorder under the pro<Col N="1023" /> posed new legislation will be limited to approved centres.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the involuntary admission of children who are defined in the Bill as those under the age of 18 years. In keeping with the approach adopted in the Child Care Act, 1991, in relation to children at risk, the involuntary admission of mentally disordered children is subject to parental consent or an order of the District Court. Where a health board believes a child is mentally disordered and where the parents cannot or will not consent to treatment, the health board may make an application to the courts for an order permitting the involuntary admission of the child for psychiatric care and treatment. An order for the child's detention and treatment may be renewed by the court after 28 days, three months, six months, 12 months and annually thereafter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new procedures governing involuntary admissions, transfers and returns to hospital. Under these, the applicant, spouse or relative will continue to take primary responsibility for initiating an application for involuntary admission and the applicant must be over 18 years. A spouse will be disqualified if in dispute, for example, if a court order has been granted under family law or if he or she is departing or has departed from the marriage. The applicant will be required to have contact with the person to whom the application relates within the previous two days. If a spouse or relative is unwilling or disqualified from making an application, an application may be made by an authorised officer of a health board who is suitably qualified and who is not employed directly in the mental health service. The application will then be forwarded to a registered medical practitioner who will examine the person who is the subject of the application within 24 hours of its receipt. The practitioner shall inform the person of the purpose of the examination unless in his view the provision of such information might be prejudicial to the person's mental health, well-being or emotional condition. Where the registered medical practitioner is satisfied, following an examination, that the person is suffering from a mental disorder he shall make a recommendation in a form specified by the commission that the person be involuntarily admitted. Where, following the refusal of an application, a further application is made in respect of the same person, the applicant must inform the medical practitioner of the facts relating to the previous refusal. I welcome the inclusion of these safeguards in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Where a person is received at an approved centre on a recommendation under section 9, a consultant psychiatrist on the staff of the approved centre shall carry out an examination of the person. If the consultant is satisfied that the person is suffering from mental illness he or she may make an order to be known as an &ldquo;involuntary admission order&rdquo; in a form specified by the commission for the reception, treatment and deten<Col N="1024" /> tion of the patient. If the consultant is not satisfied that the patient is suffering from mental illness, he or she may refuse to make an order.</P>
    <P>A consultant psychiatrist or a registered nurse on the staff of the approved centre shall be entitled to take charge of the person concerned and detain him or her for a period not exceeding 24 hours for the purpose of carrying out an examination. An admission order shall remain in place for 28 days and this period may be extended by a renewal order for three months, for a further six months or for periods not exceeding 12 months thereafter. The consultant psychiatrist shall examine the person not more than one week before making the order concerned and certify in a form specified by the commission that the patient continues to suffer from a mental disorder. The consultant must give notice in writing to the patient of the making of the order and must also inform the patient that he or she is being detained or that he or she will continue to be detained under a renewal order. The patient must also be informed that he or she is entitled to legal representation. We have come a long way from the days when people were detained in Our Lady's Hospital in Cork and the key was thrown away.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for transferring the person in respect of whom an application for detention has been made will remain with the applicant. If the applicant is unable to make the necessary arrangements, it will be the responsibility of the clinical director to arrange the transfer. If persuasion by an experienced member of the clinical team fails to secure the agreement of the person to come to the approved centre it is proposed that the clinical director may request the Garda to assist the staff of the approved centre to transfer the patient. The Bill proposes that the Garda shall comply with such a request. I welcome this development because, in the past, individual gardaí did not realise they had a role to play in this regard because that role may not have been clearly defined in law.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient may allow the patient to be absent from the approved centre for a specified period and may set certain conditions to such leave. Where a patient is absent from a centre without leave, the clinical director may arrange for the patient to be returned to the centre and, if necessary, request the Garda to assist. Where the consultant psychiatrist who is responsible for the care of a patient is of the opinion that a patient is no longer suffering from a mental disorder he or she shall by order in a form specified by the commission revoke the relevant admission or renewal order and discharge the patient.</P>
    <P>Current legal formalities regarding the admission and discharge of voluntary patients will be removed. Authorised nurses in approved centres will be given legal authority to hold voluntary patients, in certain circumstances, up to 24 hours during which time the patient must be examined <Col N="1025" /> by a consultant psychiatrist who may hold him or her for a further 48 hours. Arrangements must be made during the latter period for the patient's detention or discharge.</P>
    <P>I welcome the review of detention orders. The mental health review board will consist of a psychiatrist and a legal assessor appointed by the commission. The tribunal will review every initial decision to detain a person in a psychiatric hospital and each decision to extend detention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of consent to treatment contained in the Bill. As defined in section 55, this is consent in writing obtained freely without threats or inducement. Where it is proposed to perform psycho-surgery on a patient, the patient's consent and the authorisation of a tribunal must be obtained. Electro-convulsive therapy cannot be performed on a patient unless the patient gives his or her consent. Everyone is aware of cases in the past where people were strapped to beds and given treatment they either did not request or which they should not have received. I am glad those days are long gone. Where the patient cannot give such consent the treatment must be approved by two consultant psychiatrists. Where a patient has been on medication continuously for more than three months, the medication cannot be continued except with the patient's consent. Where the patient cannot give such consent, the treatment must be approved by two consultant psychiatrists. This procedure must be followed every three months while medication continues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the adult care orders. According to the Law Reform Commission report, these should be modelled on the Child Care Act, 1991. The proposal to introduce them is welcome. The Law Reform Commission has recommended that evidence be given by a consultant psychiatrist in application proceedings where they appear unnecessarily restrictive and that it may be appropriate to permit evidence to be given by a consultant geriatrician or even general practitioner, who should be given some role in a community orientated protective option. The courts would initially decide on the duration of the order and the mental health review board would decide for or against continuation of the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I welcome the Deputy's comments on adult care orders, but there is no provision for such orders in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for them to be included. The Mental Treatment Act does not provide for protection of the property of mentally disordered adults except by making the person a ward of the court. The Law Reform Commission recommended that the ward of court procedure should be integrated with detention procedures so that the property of a person detained against his will is automatically protected. When a detention order is made the wards of court office should be immediately notified and a wardship procedure commenced by the solicitor unless <Col N="1026" /> there is an enduring power of attorney. This matter should be addressed in the Bill and I urge the Minister to look at it.</P>
      <P>Transitional provisions within six months of the Bill coming into operation and the detention of patients in psychiatric hospitals should be independently reviewed. For three years after the commencement of the Act, hospitals and other facilities providing care and treatment for persons with a mental disorder will continue at approved centres. I commend the Bill to the House, especially in view of my experience as a young boy in attending Our Lady's Hospital to visit relatives who were detained there for no sane reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. It has been a long time in gestation and is a small but significant step towards improving our mental health services, which have been neglected over past decades. It would be wrong to place all the blame for neglect on the Government, but it is in charge. Bigger steps are required to ensure that resources are provided to the mental health services to enable them provide the kind of service those suffering psychiatric problems deserve.</P>
      <P>It is now recognised that we have neglected the mental health services and this is reflected in the report of the inspector of mental hospitals when his report of last November revealed a disturbing picture. It is an indictment of the State's treatment of one of the most vulnerable groups &ndash; the mentally ill. Those patients have been neglected, ignored and stigmatised for decades.</P>
      <P>The inspector expresses his concern at the lack of multi-disciplinary teams in many of the mental health services. It is not acceptable, for example, that one health board with four mental health service centres has no social worker in any of them. This has been repeatedly drawn to the Minister's attention, yet action has not been taken. It is unacceptable that psychological services are poorly represented and, in some cases, non-existent. What plans, if any, has the Government to deal with this? It is unfair to ask the Minister of State to respond. The Minister must have a view and plans to deal with this situation.</P>
      <P>At a time of highly developed medical treatment in the general hospitals it is nothing short of discrimination bordering on abuse that drug prescribing in some locations is often arbitrary and made without regard to appropriate clinical diagnosis. The inspector was concerned at the number of patients, especially long stay patients, who were on numerous drugs simultaneously, often on high doses. In some instances the prescription had not been reviewed for some time. Does the Minister accept that medication should be reviewed at frequent intervals and that failure to review it is a sign of serious negligence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector reports on the increasing number of sudden deaths in psychiatric hospitals, some of which were attributed to drug related effects. I commend journalist Vincent Browne for raising this issue in <i>The Irish Times. </i>Few other journalists paid attention, but it is worth quoting what <Col N="1027" /> he said: &ldquo;The inspector's comments implies that very serious crimes, even manslaughter or criminal negligence, may have been committed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Medical note-taking and keeping a medical record is an important tool in the management of modern medical systems. I am very concerned about the inadequacy and quality of medical note-taking in some mental health services. This relates especially to the consultant's input, both on or shortly after admission to hospital, and at subsequent clinical reviews and progress assessments. Surely this approach should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of the report of the national task force on suicide was that steps should be taken to make the health services, especially mental health services, accessible to the public, particularly the young who may perceive them as being not readily available to address their needs at times of crisis. Psychiatric community services, especially in rural areas, are totally inadequate and are the Cinderella of the health services. There are inadequate day hospitals and community residential facilities for persons with psychiatric disorders. It is unacceptable that in some hospitals as many as half of the acute psychiatric beds are occupied by persons who do not need such a high level of in-patient care. A major reason for this is the absence of appropriate alternative residential facilities.</P>
    <P>The service to our fellow citizens who are suffering from mental illness is disgraceful. It has led to the stigmatisation of people suffering from a psychiatric disorder. The Minister must, as a matter of urgency, deal with and respond to this scandal. The abuse of people is horrifying, especially when it is done by the system to the most vulnerable citizens in our society. They deserve special vigilance and care. The way we treat these citizens is a profound indictment on our society and our values.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the year for which the most recent statistics are available, 504 people died by suicide, an increase of almost 15% on the previous year. This issue has rightly caused shock in society. Most of those who were suicidal or who died by suicide were under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>Action must be taken to address this problem immediately. Other states have introduced effective suicide prevention programmes and it is urgent that the Government follows suit. We must reduce the levels of suicide and ensure that those who feel suicidal can get help from the State agencies. This help must be readily and easily contactable and available 24 hours a day every week of the year. The recommendations of the national task force on suicide are clear and unambiguous and I call on the Minister and the Government to implement them in full immediately. Other Departments are involved here, especially the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> In 1998, 504 people committed suicide, compared with 433 the previous year. The majority of people who took their lives were male &ndash; 42l as opposed to 83 females. The Government must ensure that the training of medical personnel includes recognition and management of suicidal behaviour as an integral part of such training and continuing education. Health boards should immediately establish a directory of voluntary and statutory services for those at risk of suicide. This should be available to all appropriate statutory and voluntary services and in the offices of general practitioners.</P>
    <P>The Government must introduce proper treatment for the mentally ill who are in prison.</P>
    <P>In June 1998 the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, announced that a national educational and psychological service would be available to all primary and post-primary schools and to the young who are no longer in formal education. That is important because a higher number of young people who leave the education system early commit suicide than those who remain in the system. He also announced that a new social, personal and health education subject would be introduced in the primary curriculum to deal with issues such as self-esteem and the need to express feelings. When will this be introduced? It is almost two years since the announcement was made. It is important that young people are trained to deal with crises in their lives, to recognise that they are not unique and that they can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is urgent that assistance be provided to young people who leave school early as there is a particularly high rate of suicide among this group. The Minister should make an order that radio and television programmes which deal with suicide and related issues should display helpline numbers and referral information. The health services, including mental health services, must be more accessible to the public, particularly the young who might perceive them as not being readily available to address their needs.</P>
    <P>Adolescence, the period between childhood and adulthood, has gradually been extended during the 20th century. The pace of social and cultural change has never been faster. The life expectancy of most jobs is five years and skills can fast become redundant. Individuals must be more adaptable. What is an opportunity for some is a threat for others. Stresses affect both young men and women, although young males seem to be less adaptable to changes in their status.</P>
    <P>Education which is proactive against both suicide and attempted suicide must be broadened, particularly in the case of boys, to encompass the various modern social and domestic conditions. Whereas the physical health of young people might be better in comparison with years ago, the same cannot be said about the social and psychological pressures to which young people are exposed. This is partly due to the increasing instability of family life and a changing sense of per<Col N="1029" /> sonal and family relationships. In this context, I ask the Minister to consider the establishment of a committee, task force or group to examine the pressures on young people, to determine the range and size of the problems facing them in modern society and to determine the best methods of addressing them from a social, recreational and educational perspective.</P>
    <P>As regards the extension of psychiatric services to the community, the task force on suicide recommends that: </P>
    <P>. . . the recommendations of the report on the development of mental health services, Planning for the Future, be implemented in full. In particular, the Task Force recommends the provision of an extensive network of community-based psychiatric services, bringing specialised multi-disciplinary psychiatric services within easy reach and accessibility of all citizens and referral agencies so that psychiatric services are readily available and acceptable to all. This will lead to more frequent and earlier referral of potentially suicidal patients and enable them to receive earlier and more effective treatment.</P>
    <P>The task force also endorses the policy outlined in Planning for the Future of establishing acute psychiatric units at general hospitals which will facilitate early intervention for people who attend accident and emergency departments having attempted suicide.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the discharge of suicidal people from psychiatric hospitals. There seems to be no policy to deal with such people. Research in the United Kingdom shows that people who are discharged from psychiatric hospitals are 100 to 200 times more likely to commit suicide in the four weeks after being discharged. I know people who were concerned about their loved ones being discharged from a psychiatric hospital into the community because they were afraid they would commit suicide. I know of two cases where this happened, despite consultations with the hospital. The Minister must examine how we deal with people who are suicidal. There are specific policies dealing with this issue in the North of Ireland. It is sad for someone to say their son or brother will commit suicide if they are released from hospital.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact we have the lowest crime rate of any European state, we have the highest level of suicides in prison. Last year six people committed suicide in prison. Prisoners are a high risk group. Dr. Enda Dooley, the director of the Prison Medical Services, stated:</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it is inevitable given the complications of the people with risk factors, young male and substance abusers disproportionate with different levels of mental disorder coming from deprived backgrounds. When all these come together in the crisis laden atmosphere in prison then it is inevitable, unfortunately, that on occasions suicide will occur.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> What constitutes the prisons' best efforts when we have the equivalent of two full-time psychiatrists for more than 2,600 prisoners?</P>
    <P>A report published last November by the European CPT Commission recommended that in-patient psychiatric services for prisoners be reorganised as a matter of urgency. Fr. Fergal McDonagh, head of the prison chaplains, stated:</P>
    <P>If a prisoner is lucky enough to see a psychiatrist, a prisoner might be lucky if he saw that psychiatrist for 5 minutes. That would be stretching it I think. Unfortunately, the psychiatric system we have is essentially one where its main function is dispensing or prescribing medication, sleeping tablets and anti-depressants. Counselling is non-existent in our prison system.</P>
    <P>Prisoners at risk are kept under observation so they can be checked by a staff member every 15 minutes. Dr. Charles Smith from the Central Mental Hospital does not accept that checking a prisoner every 15 minutes is enough to prevent suicide. He states: </P>
    <P>The problem with the routine response of prisons to suicidality is the 15 minute observation. Clearly 15 minutes of observation leaves 14 minutes and 50 seconds of non-observation. So it is not really a good way of preventing suicide on those who are determined. The only way, and it will require a lot of staffing, is eye to eye contact or to make that eye to eye contact more likely in some sort of a ward setting.</P>
    <P>Prisoners identified as disturbed or at risk of suicide in prison are sent to the Central Mental Hospital. However, a severe shortage of beds there often results in a prisoner being held in a padded cell in prison.</P>
    <P>I will again quote Fr. McDonagh, head of the prison chaplains:</P>
    <P>If a person verbalises or uses that language and says that he is depressed or suicidal, the response within our prison system is they are stripped to their underwear, they are taken down to a room that is about six feet by five feet, padded or some of our prisons are not even padded. There is a plastic mattress on the floor and a blanket that is designed that it cannot be torn and used as a ligature and they are left in there and they eat their meals off the floor. Some people might only spend a day in it, but some people have spent weeks in that type of almost like sensory deprivation, especially in the world we live in, it would not happen in a psychiatric hospital across the road. The Central Mental Hospital is the only psychiatric facility available for prisoners.</P>
    <P>Prison health care should be of the same standard as health care throughout the community. The difficulty is that we do not accept mental ill health in the same way as physical ill health. A prisoner who is physically ill will be taken to a hospital <Col N="1031" /> and treated but a prisoner who is mentally ill will be taken to a padded cell. Why is he or she not taken to a psychiatric hospital and treated the same way as a person with any other illness? People who are psychiatrically ill or suicidal are not a threat to society. There is no threat of escape because of their condition. They simply need treatment.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a detailed examination of why there is such a high level of suicides in prisons. There must also be a comprehensive review of how we treat the mentally ill in prison. It is estimated in the US that 10% of prisoners suffer from psychiatric illness. We can assume, therefore, that 10% of our prison population &ndash; over 200 people &ndash; are also suffering from psychiatric illnesses and are not being properly treated for them.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. It provides a modern framework within which people who are mentally disordered can receive care and treatment. It is important legislation for those who need such treatment or protection and for those who provide it. The Bill will bring Irish law into line with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
      <P>The fact that we can discuss the mental health issue is of value in itself. Too often in the past people with mental illness were hidden away and forgotten. It was considered a terrible stigma and was brushed under the carpet for too long. It is important that we discuss all aspects of mental health. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.</P>
      <P>The core provision in the Bill is the establishment of the mental health commission. It will comprise ten members &ndash; a practising barrister or solicitor, two registered medical practitioners of whom one will be a consultant psychiatrist, two representatives of the nursing profession, a social worker, a psychologist, members of the general public and two representatives of voluntary bodies which promote the interests of people suffering from mental illness. The latter group is becoming more numerous and vocal. Its members deserve a place on the new commission. There is a wide sphere of involvement so the commission should provide adequate representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission will be a mechanism whereby standards of care and treatment in the mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated. This will be of benefit to all concerned and will ensure standardisation of best practice. I have encountered many people in the mental health services sector who work above and beyond the call of duty. When they hear about the establishment of a commission they tend to think of it as an entity to look over their shoulders and that there is an assumption they are not doing their jobs. However, in this instance the commission will assist practitioners in the promotion of high standards and good practice in an <Col N="1032" /> area where the recipient of the support is most vulnerable and in need of best practice.</P>
    <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be replaced by the Office of Inspector of Mental Health Services. It will be under the auspices of the commission and both bodies will be independent of the Department of Health and Children. It is a big step. The Minister believes that giving the commission and the inspectorate independent status will be crucial in driving the agenda for change and modernisation in the mental health services, something that must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Among its many important functions, the office of the inspector will be able to review a person's detention. It will be charged not only with assessing acute in-patient services and facilities on an annual basis but also with reviewing mental health services in terms of community residences and day centres. That will give the office a more rounded view of what is going on at grassroots level rather than focusing on a specific area of mental health. Many services fall under the remit of different Departments. Many problems in relation to children, for example, fall under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science as well as the Department of Health and Children. It is important, in this instance, that the inspector can review all mental health services and that his reports will be published along with the mental health commission's reports.</P>
    <P>Another important responsibility for the inspector is the register of approved centres in which each hospital or in-patient facility providing psychiatric care and treatment must be registered. I do not consider this a threat to people who are currently providing care. It will only ensure the standardisation of best practice. The register will be held in the mental health commission.</P>
    <P>Regulations will be made specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres, including the requirements in relation to food and accommodation, care and welfare of patients, suitability of staff and the keeping of records. At present, different organisations are being set up to look after people with a mental disorder. The keeping of records and ensuring that proper requirements are followed is most important. The execution and enforcement of the regulations will be the responsibility of the inspector of mental health services.</P>
    <P>The mental health issue has gained great momentum within the community. Health boards are reaching out to communities and community groups are reaching out to the State agencies in an effort to promote their plans. This is a tremendous change from the historic situation. I congratulate the people in the voluntary sector for the tremendous work they do and the co-operation they receive from State agencies. It is heartening to see it.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years there has been increasingly obvious movement towards the development of an integrated and community based approach to <Col N="1033" /> the care of the mentally ill. There is a need for legislation to keep pace with these advances. Modern Ireland must have a place both in legislation and in the community for people with mental illness. This Bill attempts to enhance the care of such people and to take into account the families concerned.</P>
    <P>Given the type of society in which we live, there is a very fine line between what can be termed sanity and what is, for want of a better word, insanity. The pace of life for everyone has increased so much that for us life can get us into situations where our mental stability can be rocked slightly or in a more severe way. Therefore, in a sense, it is a case of there but for the grace of God go I. It is in that sense that it is important developments continue to be made to services and to research and support to ensure that more people, with proper management and treatment, are in a position to carry on normal lives and to contribute, as much as possible, to our society in a positive and fruitful manner.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the tremendous work Deputy Neville does in regard to suicide. I would like to underscore the importance of this subject given the increase in the number of suicides which have and continue to occur, according to the statistics we observe. I agree with Deputy Neville that health services should be accessible to young people in times of crisis.</P>
    <P>Recently, I attended a seminar run by the Moville mental health group. People from The Samaritans, Schizophrenia Ireland and many other agencies attended. The Samaritans began their talk by saying they were changing their approach in dealing with people. They said they were going to send more people out and about to deal with cases and that instead of hearing a person at the other end of the telephone after office hours, they would play a message. They pressed a tape recorder which relayed the following message: &ldquo;Sorry, we are only open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. We are unavailable now but if you are feeling suicidal, press one&rdquo; and so on. There was outrage among the people at the conference. It was a mean trick to play but it was a very good experience for those in the hall. It was not the new approach by The Samaritans but it woke people up to the fact that when someone faces a crisis, they need support, someone at the other end of the telephone and they need facilities. We are talking mostly about in-patient facilitation but we should always remember that prevention is always better than cure. We learned an important lesson in about 60 seconds at that seminar on mental health.</P>
    <P>We face more and more problems with substance abuse, which was alluded to by others. Substance abuse, whatever substance, is increasingly altering people's personalities. Individuals who are not necessarily under any other pressure find their personality being changed by the substance abuse in which they are involved. There must be an increased focus on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> When one considers the horror stories of mental hospitals in the past and the years people stayed in institutions until they were so institutionalised that they could not survive outside the system, I thank God and the Minister for this Bill because those days are truly gone. While they probably served some purpose in the past, there have been great developments since the closure of many of these same units. More effective treatment techniques have helped those in in-patient care. The safeguards to their personal welfare in terms of exploitation or abuse deserved further consideration.</P>
    <P>It is was probably a bit naive of me but I did not realise until I heard the Minister speak that the right to consent to treatment had not always been there and that it was not inscribed in law. Under the Bill, the patient must now consent to treatment. Previously, it would have been felt that people were involuntary detained &ndash; a sentence that was often not reviewed but in this Bill, there is a focus on improving and modernising the criteria and mechanisms for the involuntary detention. It establishes a system of automatic and independent review of all detentions &ndash; a vital focus in this day and age.</P>
    <P>It also puts in place a framework by which the standards of care and treatment provided in our in-patient mental health facilities can be supervised and regulated. This independent review is extremely important given events in the past. Within 28 days of a person's detention, they have the right to a review. A person's right to be discharged before 28 days is contained in section 27 and they are to be informed when they are to be discharged. Will the families of those detained be informed of when the patient is to be discharged? The discharge of an in-patient without the knowledge of those close to them often causes problems.</P>
    <P>The review is extremely important. Reviews will be carried out by the mental health tribunal and it will consist not only of medical but legal assessors. It is important that people who have a mental disorder are treated as people and not as things. I am glad they have the right to legal aid and the right to legally challenge their detention. That offers them a protection which is rightly theirs. However, I ask that the family have some input in terms of being informed of how things are moving and what is going on.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about people who, after an accident, suffer a head injury and said they would be in a different category and that resourcing is important. All patients in the mental health area fall into various categories. I have visited my local facilities on numerous occasions and there is quite a mixture of people, including violent, loud, quiet and restrained people. They are often placed in the same facility or in the same room. We cannot expect a violent child or adult who is an in-patient to stay in the same facility or room as a quiet restrained person because that creates difficulties. There are difficulties in terms <Col N="1035" /> of resourcing and that is one of the big challenges which remain.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate people working in my locality in the mental health area. I would be proud to take anyone to the James Connolly Hospital, which the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, recently visited. The work being done there is tremendous. However, the building is old and the Minister should take cognisance of the work they intend to carry out. They are moving towards a bungalow system where people are left to their own devices so that they can develop interpersonal skills and as much independence as they can. It also provides space so that one can keep people of the same type together, which keeps people happy. I commend that group on the amount of work it is doing in the arts. Much more support should be given to recreational facilities for people in these institutions, for the want of a better word.</P>
    <P>Therapy is very important and many people benefit from it, especially through music and art. A specific budget should be created, if it does not exist already, to finance these resources and facilities.</P>
    <P>There is a nursing unit in Buncrana which needs to be kept open. People believe the mental health unit within it is under threat. I worry about the elderly who care for special needs people because young people with a mental disorder are living longer. Many parents are worried about what will happen to their children when they are not around to care for them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would examine the Cashel na Cor organisation which cares for people with a mild mental handicap in Clonmany and for elderly people in many day centres. I congratulate the Irish Wheelchair Association on donating a bus to enable children and adults in rural areas to be included. However, a great deal remains to be done in terms of transport.</P>
    <P>The most important task is to examine the residential care problem. Granting funding now will ensure a long-term solution. The Minister and his predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, have done good work, but more must be done to put at rest the minds of parents, especially elderly parents. In the context of our growing economy I would like to think that the next budget would grant funding for the development of residential care units to bring them up to date. Our priority should be to have facilities which reflect the positive moves in medication, social reactions and those made in the Bill. Those who cannot contribute to the community should be given a sense that they are part of it. It must be one of the legacies of the Government that, at the end of its five year term, it can point to the fact that there were positive developments in the provision of residential care.</P>
    <P>We should not speak of closeted or forgotten people. We owe it to such people to bring them into the open. We should show that we do not want political kudos for having done that and that <Col N="1036" /> we want to treat them as people. I welcome the efforts of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Taoiseach regarding the Special Olympics. So much of a positive nature is being done that we can only go from strength to strength. However, the resources must be put in place to address this most important issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo. Táimid ag fanacht leis le fada agus anois tá sé againn. The Bill deals with an area in which I have no expertise. However, as a Deputy for Dublin North, I am aware of and appreciate the work done by the staff and all those involved on a voluntary basis in supporting St. Ita's Hospital. They often make their presence felt in the constituency, be it through the annual concerts they hold, which are always well produced, or in the community where many of them live. I had cause to appreciate recently the generosity of those who work in St. Ita's as some of them gave me a lift during the recent bus and rail strike.</P>
      <P>The issue of mental health has been of concern to me in the context of depression, both mild and severe. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will know this from discussions we have had on St. John's Wort and the Irish Medicines Board's view on the matter. It is an issue which still considerably annoys people but also puzzles them. For example, why are such serious substances as organophosphates being considered by the Irish Medicines Board and awaiting a decision, even though they have been banned in the UK, while the sale without prescription of such a mild product as St. John's Wort is considered illegal? That is an aspect of the mental health issue to which I will refer later.</P>
      <P>Old institutions such as St. Ita's and other old psychiatric hospitals now receive investment and I welcome and appreciate that. However, there is a need to redesignate old psychiatric hospitals so that, instead of being seen in the light of the old Mental Health Act, 1945, where all clients are viewed as having a psychiatric illness, they are seen in a more modern light as service providers for people with learning disabilities. That is one of the issues I hope will be discussed further as the Bill makes its way through the Oireachtas. Redesignation is still an issue among people working in the mental health area in that they query whether it is achievable under the new law. I note that Liam Doran of the Irish Nurses' Organisation has called for this redesignation of hospitals and for a clear distinction to be made between the services provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies will have met nurses, psychiatric and other nurses and students. If we are to have a well developed and well resourced mental health service, we need to take note that the Psychiatric Nurses' Association of Ireland is on a work to rule about pay at present and that student nurses and future nurses will expect, if they are living in a fair society, not to have to pay tuition fees when other undergraduates do not <Col N="1037" /> have to pay them. I hope that issue can be dealt with as the Bill goes through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Keaveney's point about support for carers. While there have been improvements in the budget and through other means, vast improvements are still required. Carers do not receive half the attention nor half the appreciation society owes them for the intensely difficult work many of them do. Respite care would be a way of recognising much of that work. There is always room for improvement and I hope the Government can deliver on that. I agree with Deputy Keaveney that residential care is an indication of how civilised we are as a society and it is an area which requires vast improvement.</P>
    <P>In terms of bricks and mortar, which is an aspect of the Bill which ought to be addressed as much as the definitions and services provided, the maintenance work, which has improved to some extent in St. Ita's in Portrane and on which I can speak with some experience, is still appallingly slow. Notwithstanding the significant media attention that institution received, especially because of the interest shown by the journalist, Vincent Browne, the maintenance work is appallingly slow.</P>
    <P>The inspector cited huge areas of neglect over many decades and pointed out that corridors were in poor condition, with plaster falling off walls and so on. There was a recent breakdown in the water and heating systems, all of which points to appalling neglect leading to utterly disgraceful conditions in which people have to work and live. I hope this Bill will provide the necessary political impetus to resolve these problems.</P>
    <P>Unit H in St. Ita's was built at the turn of the century in a context more reminiscent of the concept of bedlam where people were packed in and forgotten about by society. There are still 20 people with severe learning disabilities living in one dormitory and day room in this unit. These are very difficult conditions in which staff and clients have to live and work. The former Minister, Deputy Cowen, visited St. Ita's and that was appreciated. The present Minister should also make time available to see the conditions in this hospital and address them based on his observations.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the developments which have taken place. Services provided in the community sometimes meet with fear on the part of members of the public who are not aware of the service being contemplated. For example, a 30 bed unit has been opened in Oldtown, north County Dublin. This unit is working very successfully and has five or six bedrooms with staff and day care facilities which also help people in the community. This is a positive side of improvements in mental health services which, unfortunately, is counterbalanced by atrocious neglect and under investment which must be recognised.</P>
    <P>The work of many voluntary organisations often goes unrecognised by people apart from those directly involved. It is important to commend organisations such as the Fingal Mental <Col N="1038" /> Health Association, St. Michael's House and Pat Reen in the Fingal workshops in Skerries and Rush. These people carry out very important work and help families who would otherwise be in a very dejected and despairing way given the weight of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I support the development of an Order of Malta proposal for a day activity resource centre in Balbriggan. This project will require considerable Government support which I hope will be forthcoming. The project has been successfully proposed and negotiated and I wish it success.</P>
    <P>Mild and severe depression permeates all aspects of society and most families are affected by it in one way or other. This is the area of mental health which has been clouded in mystery and stigma. The work of Aware has been very important in trying to overcome many of the misconceptions and misunderstandings in this area. In this context, the Minister should look again at the decision of the Irish Medicines Board by which St. John's wort may only be sold under prescription. This is not a cure-all or a treatment but it is important for people suffering mild symptoms of depression.</P>
    <P>One Opposition Deputy who is a member of the health committee expressed shock, not at the medicines board's decision but at the number of people using St. John's wort. This indicates that the issue of mild depression is more widespread than many people recognise. Perhaps it is important that this Deputy was shocked into realising this fact and the Irish Medicines Board may have performed an inadvertent service by bringing this issue to people's attention. However, this decision was taken hastily and without regard to the seriousness of other issues such as the use of organophosphates which is still awaiting a decision. Organophosphates are far more dangerous substances than St. John's wort and are used as a sheep dip. However, the two warrant comparison.</P>
    <P>There are a number of details of the Bill which need to be discussed. Some of these are minor issues but others are of major consequence to some groups. I question whether we should title the Bill the Mental Health Bill with all the stigma and negative baggage which accompanies the terminology. The areas of the Bill about which I am concerned are the inclusion of mental handicap, the use of the Garda Síochána, the lack of advocacy services, the prospect of the commission's success, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and the issue of consent.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with mental disorder, and inclusion of the term &ldquo;significant mental handicap&rdquo;, now called intellectual disability, is not appropriate for the care and treatment of people in this group. Significant mental handicap can be used to include those with a mild mental handicap who live and work in the community setting, as opposed to the institutional settings into which they were first put. Mental handicap has historically been associated with, and is born of, mental illness, its terminology and treatments. <Col N="1039" /> However, one is born with a mental handicap and needs the ethos of family support and care throughout life, unlike those with a medical condition.</P>
    <P>One is not born with a mental illness and this Bill provides for the care and treatment of specific mental illnesses. The core treatment of a psychiatric disorder or mental illness is not compatible with the care of people with a mental handicap, no matter how significant. Even today we find the inappropriate placement of people with a mental handicap in mental hospitals, 300 at present, and an over use of drugs on people with mental handicap. People included under this Bill will end up as patients in a medical model of care with reception, detention, diagnosis, treatment and cure. Other groups will find themselves wrongly termed as mentally ill.</P>
    <P>The power of the Garda Síochána to take a person believed to be suffering from a mental disorder into custody is found in a number of areas. How are gardaí to know what a mental disorder is? Will this be done with the help of an officer qualified in psychiatric illness and training? The level of stigma and negative labelling attached to the arrival of gardaí at a house or workplace does not help in the care and treatment of a person with a mental illness who will have to live and work in those same places after treatment. The use of gardaí in the removal of a person to an approved centre needs to be detailed and changed so that the criminal associations have the least impact on the community standing of families and individuals.</P>
    <P>The use of the Garda highlights the lack of community assistance in this area. Is it necessary to use the Garda to deal with a person who has a mental illness?</P>
    <P>The lack of advocacy services is important. While admission, referral of admission, review of admission, input from the commission and appeal to the courts are provided for, the lack of advocacy services is a serious shortcoming in the Bill. The lack of provision for such services is a serious deficit in an area where people might be detained against their will, even with the greatest of legal intentions. Independent advocacy services should exist in mandatory institutions, approved centres and similar services, as was recommended in the report of the Commission on Disability in 1996. The mental health commission to be established by this Act may not be strong enough or independent enough to protect at a very basic level. Advocacy needs to take place at a very personal level, one to one, with no strings attached.</P>
    <P>I wish the new commission every success. Having had an inspector of mental hospitals from 1945 to the present day, and having seen the obvious failure in maintaining any type of standard, one can only hope an inspector of mental health services employed by the proposed mental health commission will change that. In England there are many non-statutory health groups which lobby for services. It may be argued that in <Col N="1040" /> the absence of such a strong lobby in Ireland, some form of non-statutory group participation is necessary in mental health. This is similar to and should be viewed alongside the need for independent advocacy services in mental health.</P>
    <P>The definitions in the Bill are unacceptably vague, they are open to subjective interpretation. More detailed guidance on each of the criteria is needed to deal with modern influences. The inclusion of &ldquo;mental health&rdquo; is an infringement on the rights of this group of people and upholds the stigma with which they must live. This definition of certain psychiatric problems is used generally by the media; it should be more strictly defined.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Health and Children will take up the invitation, as his predecessor did, to visit St. Ita's to see how it operates and the needs it has. The proper funding of such an institution, so it can put behind it the many decades of neglect which are still evident, would be a measure of our commitment to improving mental health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has been a long time in the making and will place services for people with mental health problems in a modern framework. People who need psychiatric treatment may need it in their own interests or in the interests of others and this Bill gives us a model by which such people can be looked after. It will ensure the civil and human rights of people who receive psychiatric care and treatment are fully respected and that the highest international standards and norms are followed.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for children, I am concerned about mental health and the young. Children are one of the most vulnerable groups in society, particularly in cases of social disadvantage or domestic tragedy, where the child concerned is sometimes left without a parent or guardian willing or able to speak up for him or her. I am pleased the Bill sets out provisions which will ensure that such children, if they are suffering from a mental disorder, will get the care and treatment they need.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has dealt with adolescents and children will be conscious of the rates of para-suicide and suicide among the young. There would be very few teachers who have not come into contact with a young person who has threatened suicide or who has succeeded in taking his or her own life. It is tragic to see the suicide figures for children and adolescents. It is the most common cause of death for people aged between 15 and 24 years, more prevalent than cancer or road accidents. That is a cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could only be horrified to see that in 1998, 53 of those who took their own lives were aged between ten and 19 years, 52 of whom were aged between 15 and 19. It is a complex issue and it is difficult to understand why anyone would go down that road. There are factors such as depression and anxieties but such traits must be <Col N="1041" /> added to a person's ability to cope. There are other contributory factors. Studies have shown that background and family circumstances are an influence in this traumatic event.</P>
    <P>I am particularly worried about the 15 year old to 19 year old age group. The one thing all 15 to 19 year olds have in common is the pressure on them to succeed, be that in examinations or in front of their peers. We should ask ourselves if we are making young people believe, in a time of economic success, that such success is the all important goal. We must teach people that trying is important, that is not necessary to be the best but to be the best a person can be.</P>
    <P>Each case is different. Each child who takes his or her own life is a complex person and the more information we have about this issue, the better we will be able to help these young people, particularly young men.</P>
    <P>Para-suicide is a cause of concern and money has been made available to conduct research into the issue. A para-suicide, be that person making a definite attempt to take his or her own life, or where there is no intention of doing so, is 20 times more likely to succeed eventually in taking his or her own life. We must pay attention to young people who try to overdose on medication or alcohol or lacerate themselves. That is a cry for help and we must learn how to respond to it.</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Bill is concerned with a small group of people who enter the system for treatment and care. The Act defines children as being under the age of 18, unless the person is or has been married. This definition is consistent with that contained in the Child Care Act, 1991. In the existing legislation governing the mental health services, the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, all persons over the age of 16 are treated as adults. By classifying people between 16 and 18 as children, this Bill will significantly strengthen the safeguards surrounding the involuntary detention of people in this age group.</P>
    <P>A key principle recognised by the Government in the care of all people with a mental disorder is that the least restrictive form of care should be provided wherever possible. The treatment of psychiatric problems in children and adolescents takes place mainly on an out patient basis and in the community. In a small number of cases, however, children and adolescents may need to be admitted to a hospital for treatment of serious conditions. Under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, the admission of persons under 16 years of age to psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric departments of general hospitals is limited to voluntary admissions on the application of the person's parent or guardian.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement among those familiar with the mental health services that the existing provisions are not adequate to meet the needs of children aged 12 or older who may require treatment for a mental disorder and who may have no contact with their parents or who may not have a parent who is prepared to apply for their admission to hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> The Government recognises that the vast majority of admissions of children to psychiatric in-patient facilities will continue to be initiated by the child's parent or parents. It is also recognised that in such circumstances formalities should be kept to a minimum, on the model of a child's admission to a general or a children's hospital. There is a need, however, in exceptional cases for a procedure to allow for the admission of children or young persons to appropriate centres without parental consent.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, enables a court to make a care order where the court is satisfied that the child requires care or protection, which he or she is unlikely to receive unless he or she is placed in the care of a health board. While a health board would have the authority to give consent to any necessary psychiatric examination, treatment or assessment with respect to a child who is the subject of a care order under the Child Care Act, it was never intended that this provision would be used as the procedure for the involuntary admission of children for psychiatric treatment. That is why we have included such provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that provision for the admission of children without the consent of parents or guardians needs to be made for a small and exceptional number of children with a mental disorder who fulfil the criteria for involuntary admission as set out in the Bill but whose parents or guardians are unable or unwilling to give consent. Such children include those suffering from severe depression, schizophrenia, psychosis or a significant mental handicap who may be a danger to themselves or others and who need treatment in an approved centre. The Government is also aware that there is a constitutional presumption that the welfare of a child is to be found within the family unless the courts are satisfied that there are compelling reasons this cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this Bill makes provision in section 24 for the admission for treatment without parental consent of a child who meets the criteria for involuntary admission set down elsewhere in the Bill. In the exceptional circumstances where parental consent to the child's admission cannot be obtained, the health board concerned may make an application to the District Court for an order authorising the child's admission. This procedure is in keeping with the approach adopted in the Child Care Act, 1991, in relation to children at risk.</P>
    <P>Section 24 empowers the court to direct the health board concerned to have the child examined by a consultant psychiatrist and to have the report of the examination submitted to the court. If the report of the consultant psychiatrist confirms that the child is suffering from a mental disorder, the court can make an order for the child's admission and detention for treatment. The initial court order will be for a period of 28 days and may be renewed by the court for periods of three months, six months, 12 months and annually <Col N="1043" /> thereafter. These time limits are the same as those that apply to adult admission orders elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 24(6) is another important provision. It allows the court to give directions as it sees fit on the care and custody of the child during the period when the application is under consideration. This will be a most important consideration in the case of a child or a young person who might be at risk of self-harm or of causing injury to other people.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a comprehensive framework in relation to children, which ensures that, in the exceptional cases, where parental consent cannot be obtained children and young people who are mentally disordered can get the care and treatment they need. In that respect, it is a most welcome addition to the considerable body of existing legislation that protects our children and young people.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will affect only a very small number of children and young people. The treatment of psychiatric problems in children takes place mainly on an out-patients basis and in the community. There has been considerable investment in these services in recent years.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue resources of approximately £3 million have been provided since 1998 to enable improvements in multi-disciplinary teams to be undertaken in the child and adolescent services. It is intended that these services will continue to be developed in the next few years. A draft policy document on the further development of mental health services for children and adolescents has been completed. The draft report sets out the objectives of child and adolescent psychiatric services, outlines the type of services provided, highlights issues that require resolution and puts forward recommendations for their resolution. These include the strengthening of multi-disciplinary teams and the provision of residential facilities for the various age groups from younger children to adolescents. The draft development plan was circulated to all health boards for their comments. The views received from the boards raise a number of matters which are being analysed and then the policy document will be presented.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that a national strategy is put in place to ensure overall services in the area of child and adolescent psychiatric services are provided in a consistent and co-ordinated manner. The Minister intends to establish a working group with the participation of the chief executive officers of the health boards to finalise the development plan. The Department of Health and Children is currently in communication with the health boards in this regard, but in the interim the Department is in discussion in relation to the provision of residential care and adolescent facilities to meet urgent service needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes important provisions in relation to a very small number of children and young people who require to be admitted involuntarily <Col N="1044" /> for treatment without parental consent. It is important that their needs and their rights are protected and met.</P>
    <P>In relation to the broader sphere of child and adolescent psychiatric services generally, significant funds have been invested and with the establishment of the working group and the production of a development plan, we will ensure that the services will be further expanded. We need to promote positive mental health. We need to destigmatise suicide and to promote positive attitudes of support towards young people and their families. The Minister and I are committed to facilitating all of this as far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this important Bill. During my contribution on the Children Bill, 1999, yesterday I said that we were providing legislation for the most vulnerable children in our society, for whom, in many cases through no fault of their own, life is difficult and has little to offer. This Bill will provide for the most vulnerable people in our society whose quality of life depends not only on what we legislate for them in this House but far more importantly on the services and the back up facilities we provide for them.</P>
      <P>We debated legislation this week to provide for two of the most important groups in our society, vulnerable children and those with a mental disorder. The two groups are interlinked in that many children who find themselves before our courts or in trouble with the law end up in our mental institutions, although that is not always the case. I welcome the Bill which deals with standards of care and treatment in our mental institutions. I am pleased it provides that the standard of treatment and care will be monitored, inspected and regulated.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that we debate this Bill under the shadow of 700 psychiatric nurses in hospitals and day centres across the state beginning industrial action over a failure by the Government to agree a promised rate of pay. According to one of today's newspapers, under their work to rule, which will continue for one month and then be reviewed, the nurses in promoted grades are refusing to answer telephones, attend meetings and carry out clerical and administrative duties. One might ask what that has to do with this Bill. I raise it because this Bill is about people with mental illness. For that reason I plead with the Minister to take steps immediately to resolve this dispute because he knows as well as I that patients will lose out as a result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the intention of those in dispute. However, it is what will inevitably happen if the dispute is not terminated. These patients cannot make progress in an unsettled environment where workers are disenchanted and disillusioned with their conditions. The seeds of serious discontent are now sown and it is vital that immediate steps are taken to resolve the difficulty, which I understand relates to a breach of commitments given during the settlement of the nurses' dispute <Col N="1045" /> last October. I raise this issue because it has an effect on patients with mental illness.</P>
    <P>The Bill speaks about the care and treatment of those will mental disorder. However, the Bill does not deal with the most important need in mental health care, that is, the physical standards and lack of resources in mental hospitals. It is easy for any Government to draft legislation and preach about its aspirations and the spirit of its intentions, but when it comes to directing finances at certain issues, we come up against a stumbling block. I raise this issue in the context of a newspaper article yesterday which stated that the Minister for Finance will once again have to cope with an additional £500 million in the Exchequer in the first three months of this year. This is what is required to deal with the crucial issues of the physical environment, structure and resources within mental hospitals. No matter how well intentioned the Bill is &ndash; I agree with its spirit and aspirations &ndash; it will all be pointless unless the physical environment within institutions is changed.</P>
    <P>It is to our shame that many institutions which care for mentally ill patients are in a shocking and disgraceful condition. I have met with families of patients who find visiting these institutions distressful and upsetting, not because of the nature of their relatives' illness but because of the environment in which their loved ones are compelled to live. These people have no complaints about the staff or quality of care but about the appalling conditions in which they find their relatives, friends or loved ones. Their inability to do anything about this issue is soul-destroying because they know, as the Minister and I do, that the public is not fully aware of these appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>We accept these patients cannot seek good conditions or speak for themselves, therefore, they need others to speak on their behalf. Is it the case that nothing will be done in this regard because those who are most affected by the conditions cannot protest? It is an appalling indictment on all of us that the most vulnerable in society, who cannot speak for themselves, are not our priority. It is an even more shocking indictment on us that these appalling conditions exist at a time of excessive financial resources. The staff in these hospitals and institutions do a wonderful job given the appalling conditions under which they work, for which they deserve our congratulations and gratitude.</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Commission proposed in the Bill will have a huge responsibility. It will have a major obligation to ensure the spirit and aspirations of the Bill in relation to the treatment and care of those who suffer from mental illness are achieved. The Minister in his speech stated that the commission's primary function will be to promote and foster high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health. This is not good enough. The commission's responsibility should be not only to promote and foster, it should be to ensure and guarantee proper treatment, care, facilities and physical resources for <Col N="1046" /> those suffering from mental illness. Any commission can say it did its best to promote and foster excellent care and treatment but the acid test is whether it was delivered. One cannot provide excellent care and top class treatment if the physical environment is wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope on Committee Stage of the Bill the words &ldquo;promote&rdquo; and &ldquo;foster&rdquo; will be replaced by &ldquo;ensure&rdquo; and &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo;. The Bill must include strong language because many aspects of our mental institutions depend on the Bill guaranteeing what is fundamentally necessary. Change and modernisation will not be achieved if we operate on the basis of just promoting and fostering high standards. Our approach must be stronger and much more definite. In other words, I ask the Minister to ensure there is zero tolerance of anything other than the highest standards, best quality care and improved and modern physical conditions for patients with a mental disorder. We often use the term &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; but it should be used in the Bill because we should strive for zero tolerance of anything other than the best for these patients.</P>
    <P>Care is not just medical, it must be all-embracing. For that reason, we must do much more research into the lives and daily routine of those with mental disorder who are, unfortunately, confined to mental institutions. There should be activities for these people and we should not allow them to be idle. Their days should be fulfilling and regulated and they should be provided with activities and programmes to which they can aspire. It is not good enough to just provide them with a roof over their heads, with medical treatment or supervision, they must be given a quality of life. Every patient, irrespective of their disability, can obtain satisfaction from something. I ask the Minister for Health and Children to put major emphasis on the quality of life of these patients. This cannot be done by just providing medical treatment, care or sufficient staff, they must be steered towards and provided with positive activities.</P>
    <P>I have met many families of people who suffer from mental illness whose stories are very sad, not just because of the illness of their relatives but because visits to them have become a very tough undertaking. Many say that in many mental institutions there is not even a proper room where they can meet their loved ones. The facilities we would consider normal and expect in hospitals and long-term centres are not available in many mental institutions. Families and patients cannot avail of family gatherings or one-to-one conversations in pleasant surroundings in these institutions. This issue must be examined.</P>
    <P>I welcome the community based approach to mental illness. Thankfully the day is long gone when people committed to a mental institution were left there to become institutionalised and totally cut off from society. The community based approach is excellent and in most cases works well. The aim at all times must be to get that person to a posi<Col N="1047" /> tion if possible, and in many cases it is possible, where they can survive with a certain amount of support and care within a community framework and lead as near a normal life as possible.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the health board has bought a residence within residential estates where people can live in a normal environment with support. Sadly there is not sufficient consultation with the local communities. Anybody of right mind would be in favour of community based care for mentally ill patients but they also want assurances and guarantees. The health board should approach this matter openly. Often there is far too much secrecy. After the residence is bought somebody in the housing estate will discover it has been bought for the health board. Rumours start and escalate and before long a group is organised to protest. That is not the true nature of the Irish people. These protests develop because of a feeling of insecurity and the secrecy through which our health boards work when acquiring such premises. That is the wrong approach and I am currently dealing with such a case.</P>
    <P>Communities would welcome this type of community based approach if they worked as partners with the health board to ensure the facility works well not only for those who will live in the residence but for the community and their children. Old attitudes die hard. Unfortunately there are still remnants of fear about what will happen. There is no need for this and it could be avoided if there was proper consultation with the community as equal partners. I ask the Minister to raise this matter with health boards given that more residences will be bought in housing estates. It is important to start on the right note. Once there is argument and dispute it is more difficult to resolve the issue than had the right approach been adopted from the first day.</P>
    <P>It is important that mental hospitals are used for the purpose for which they are intended, that is, for people with a mental disorder. The treatment, care and regime in those hospitals is for such persons. It is sad to read in the newspapers that a judge, in desperation, has nowhere to put a person with a social disorder except into a mental institution. That is wrong and is as near to a crime as one can get. We do nothing for people with specific problems if we do not have institutions to deal with their particular disorder. It is not good enough to lock them away from society. That is only fostering and encouraging further trouble. Mental hospitals are for persons with a mental disorder and must not be used as detention centres or refuges for those who should not be allowed out either for their own good or the protection of the public. The practice of using mental institutions for such problems should neither be accepted nor allowed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Bill is patient centred. Too often Bills deal with regulations and formalities and forget the people for whom the service is being provided. I am pleased a patient has a right <Col N="1048" /> to agree to treatment, that the involvement of the family is guaranteed and that any decision taken by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a person involuntarily for psychiatric care and treatment will be reviewed by an independent body. I hope we will never again see the day when people will face a life sentence in a mental institution.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all those working in the area of mental health, particularly those in the mental institutions in my constituency &ndash; St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel, and St. Michael's Hospital. Every Minister, when visiting a constituency, would do well to call to hospitals that deal with a mental disorder. I do not mean a visit where the meeting takes place in the parlour &ndash; with flowers on the table &ndash; with senior medical personnel and staff but a visit to the wards to speak with patients. They should get out to the corridors and into the rooms, day centres and the garden and see what is happening there. The Bill will be useless unless there is a huge improvement in the quality of care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ahearn regarding ministerial visits to health board regions and to psychiatric and geriatric hospitals. Successive Governments and successive Ministers have taken an interest in this issue and have visited health boards. I look forward to many more visits by the Minister and Ministers of State to hospitals and day care centres in the Western Health Board region.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister and his Ministers of State on the work they have done in the area of mental health. The Minister said the existing office of Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be replaced with the office of the inspector of mental health services. The inspector will be employed by the new commission. This reminds me of many meetings I have attended of the Western Health Board where long debates took place on the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. The one fault with the reports was that they were often debated three or four years after the inspection had taken place. I hope the new office will ensure inspections and early reports and early debates on the visit by the new inspector of mental health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the policy put forward has been taken from the policy document, Planning for the Future, published in 1984. That document was the blueprint for the development of a modern mental health service and has been accepted by successive Governments as the basis for mental health policy. One of the key recommendations of that document was the development of an integrated community based mental health service to replace the traditional model of care which relied predominantly on in-patient treatment in psychiatric hospitals. A further document, Shaping a Healthier Future, outlined the objectives of promoting mental health, restoring the mentally ill to as independent a life as possible, ensuring that mental health care is comprehensive and integrated with other health services and providing <Col N="1049" /> services within the community in sectors close to those being served. I welcome the overall thrust of the Minister's policy contained in those documents.</P>
    <P>In line with these objectives, health boards have made considerable progress in providing acute psychiatric units at general hospitals and in setting up day hospitals, day centres and community residential accommodation. These community based services will ultimately replace services which were previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. There were once more than 1,000 patients in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe. Over the years that number fell. It passed the landmark figure of 500 and in recent years the figure has dropped even lower. It is widely accepted that community based services provide a more comprehensive service for patients and a much improved quality of life for people who formerly were patients of psychiatric hospitals. The Minister has referred to the fact that the number of patients in psychiatric hospitals and acute units continues to fall. At the end of 1998 there were 5,101 such patients, which is a decrease of 9% on the 1996 figure.</P>
    <P>Community care is not always the most appropriate method of care, and in-patient treatment is provided in acute psychiatric units for people who need it. In conjunction with the development of comprehensive community based services, acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals are being developed to replace large institutions built in an era when psychiatric care was almost entirely limited to in-patient care. There are now 17 acute units attached to general hospitals throughout the country. In-patient care is also being provided in psychiatric hospitals. The proportion of patients being admitted to general hospital units rather than to psychiatric hospitals continues to increase and in 1998 it accounted for one third of all admissions.</P>
    <P>In some cases alcoholism cannot be dealt with on a day care or community care basis. In expressing my view that residential care is sometimes needed by a person who has a problem with alcohol, I have occasionally clashed with the Western Health Board. It is sometimes necessary to take such a person out of the home or community environment in order to help his or her recovery in an alcohol treatment unit. We have such a unit in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe, where the care and attention given by the staff is second to none. The best people to judge the success of these units are patients who have been treated in them and are now able to cope with their illness and talk freely about the service they have received.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of the priority now being given to the improvement of our mental health services and of the funding to be provided. He mentioned the provisions of the Bill and the development of acute psychiatric units associated with general hospitals. I welcome the provision of community based services such as mental health centres and community residences. Many small <Col N="1050" /> towns are examining the possibility of establishing appropriate centres and residences for people who have suffered from mental illness. One such town is Mountbellew in County Galway. The Minister also referred to the greater concentration on the rehabilitation of patients, many of whom are elderly, who have been in long-stay wards of psychiatric hospitals for many years. I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for his work in providing services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the pace of development of these services is accelerated an additional £12.2 million was allocated to the mental health service for the year 2000. This represents an increase of more than 100% on the additional funding provided in 1999. A sum of £2.5 million is being provided in the current year to meet the cost of setting up the Mental Health Commission.</P>
    <P>This week the House discussed the Children Bill and we recently discussed the Education (Welfare) Bill, both of which are concerned with the welfare of children. It is important that we give priority to the question of child and adolescent psychiatry. There is a need to improve our responses to the mental health needs of children and young people. The Minister has provided an additional sum of £1.378 million in 1999 and a further £1.1 million in the year 2000. This will broaden the child and adolescent psychiatric services by supporting the recruitment of additional consultants and the further development of multidisciplinary teams. Steady progress has been made in developing a specialised service for this client group and each health board now has a dedicated child and adolescent psychiatric service headed by a consultant psychiatrist.</P>
    <P>It is important that services are provided as near as possible to the homes of parents or guardians of children receiving treatment. There is no point in having children travel long distances for psychiatric services. Where travel is unavoidable it is imperative that escorts are present on transport for young psychiatric patients and proper safety measures, including safety belts, are provided. There is a need for further development of the child and adolescent psychiatric services. The Minister has said that a policy document is being prepared which will include the identification of areas of particular need. The main shortcomings relate to the lack of in-patient facilities, particularly for adolescents, and priority is being given to this problem as part of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is dealing with the question of services, particularly psychiatric services, for the elderly. Old age psychiatric services have been expanding in recent years and the integration of community and hospital based psychiatric services with services for older people is progressing. Additional funding of £3.125 has been provided since 1998 to establish these specialist services in health boards where no service existed heretofore. Schemes such as community alert and neighbourhood <Col N="1051" /> watch are very important and the Minister of State's promise to provide fire alarms and security systems for elderly people will be very welcome, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the question of suicide and Deputy Dan Neville has spoken about this issue on many occasions. The health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, expressed concern at the rate of suicide. In November 1995 a national task force on suicide was established to address the growing prevalence of this tragedy in our society. In September 1996 the task force published a detailed report which contained a detailed analysis of statistics relating to suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland, and a preliminary analysis of the factors which could be associated with suicidal behaviour. The report identified young males aged between 15 and 24 as a suicide risk group.</P>
    <P>There has been a positive and committed response among statutory and voluntary agencies to finding ways of tackling this tragic problem. A suicide research group has been established by the chief executive officers of the health boards and resource officers have been appointed in all health boards with specific responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the task force. A sum of £1 million is being provided this year towards a suicide prevention programme in the health boards and research aimed at improving our understanding of the issue. Having information on the groups at highest risk of suicide is seen as a key factor in a suicide prevention strategy. International studies have found that para-suicide is a significant risk factor. Accordingly, £200,000 is being made available this year for the establishment of a national suicide research foundation in Cork and a national para-suicide register.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in what the Minister had to say about rehabilitation programmes. He stated that some patients in psychiatric hospitals have been in institutional care for many years. To transfer such patients to a more appropriate care setting in the community a programme of rehabilitation is necessary. The establishment of a dedicated rehabilitation team for planning the future of long-stay patients was recommended by the inspector of mental hospitals in his report for 1998.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board is establishing such a specialist team at St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe with additional funding provided by the Department. If this pilot project is successful I understand a similar approach will be considered for other hospitals. This is a welcome development and, in conjunction with the acute admissions unit at Portiuncula Hospital, will be of great benefit. Portiuncula Hospital has also received £6 million for other developments. The Western Health Board is assuming responsibility for services at St. Brigid's Hospital from the Franciscan Order. I hope it will be as successful in its efforts in what will now be a public hospital.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on what he had to say about community services. The growth of alterna<Col N="1052" /> tives to hospitalisation must be accelerated through the development of further community based services. An additional £8.4 million revenue funding was provided for the period 1998 to 2000 for the enhancement and development of community based mental health services. This has been used in the main to provide additional medical, paramedical and nursing support staff and to fund improvements in psychology and social work services and the continued development of multidisciplinary teams.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made with the establishment of new mental health centres, day hospital and other day facilities in recent years. Additional community based residential accommodation has also been made available. For example, in 1994 the number of community residences was 368 providing 2,685 places. This increased to 386 in 1998 providing 2,871 places. In the same period the number of day hospitals and day centres increased from 159 to 176.</P>
    <P>A sum of £150 million capital funding is being provided over the lifetime of the national development plan for mental health services. This will enable the provision of further acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals and accelerate the provision of additional community based services. The Minister listed the units which are at various stages of development. They include Portiuncula Hospital. A further four acute psychiatric units are under consideration in Dundalk, Wexford, Mallow and Mullingar. The aim of the programme is to provide accessible treatment facilities of high standard and to phase out admissions to older large scale psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a section dealing with the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care. The Minister is to reform existing legislation to bring Irish mental health law into conformity with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The provisions of the Bill relate primarily to those patients who require in-patient treatment. The majority of in-patients in acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals and psychiatric hospitals were admitted voluntarily. Due to the nature of some psychiatric illness however it is sometimes necessary to detain a small number of patients involuntarily for their own protection and that of others. In 1998 there were almost 26,000 admissions to acute psychiatric units and psychiatric hospitals. Of these 2,500 were involuntary. One of the objectives of the Bill is to ensure involuntary detentions only occur when absolutely necessary and are of minimum duration. Another is to ensure the highest standards and best practices are observed in the delivery of all mental health services. To this end the Bill provides new and improved safeguards for psychiatric patients, particularly those admitted involuntarily.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the commission and the fact that the inspector of mental hospitals will be replaced by an inspector of mental health <Col N="1053" /> services who will be required to visit and report on each centre at least once a year.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints in the past about the quality of buildings in the Western Health Board region. There is one building where renovations are taking place, that is, the Alzheimer's unit, unit 17, St. Brigid's Hospital, which has a hard-working staff. The board is now looking at funding a unit such as the one in Ballindine which was opened by the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and where John Grant is doing tremendous work. Many units in the east have been funded. To ensure a regional balance it is important that similar units are provided in the west.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill which I wish a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate. There is broad agreement on the need for reform of existing mental health legislation. A wide range of issues have been raised in relation to the Bill and the mental health services in general. It is the Minister's intention to respond to each of these in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In light of the contributions which have been made on the focus of the Bill it is important to reiterate two important points made by the Minister. The Bill will provide a modern framework within which persons who are mentally disordered and need treatment or protection either in their own interest or that of others can be cared for and treated. The Bill will bring our legislation on the detention of mentally disordered patients into conformity with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This is an important advance and one which will bring mental health law fully into line with our international obligations.</P>
      <P>Some of the comments made since the Bill was published in December have failed to recognise that it deals with much more than involuntary admission. It will put in place mechanisms by which the standards of care and treatment in mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated. The vehicle for achieving this will be the Mental Health Commission to be established under the Bill. The commission's primary function will be to promote and foster high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services. The existing office of the inspector of mental hospitals will be replaced by the office of the inspector of mental health services who will be employed by the commission. The commission and the inspector will operate independently of the Minister for Health and Children and the Department. This independent status will be crucial in driving the agenda for change and modernisation in the mental health services in coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of specific issues raised during the debate. Reference was made to <Col N="1054" /> issues raised in the 1995 White Paper and not included in the Bill. With regard to making provision for mentally disordered persons who are wards of court, I am pleased to inform the House that officials of my Department are currently in active discussions with the Registrar of the Wards of Court with a view to preparing proposals which could be included in the Bill before it completes its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The issue of adult care orders, which were proposed in the White Paper in 1995 and alluded to by Deputy Shatter, needs further assessment following experience gained in other jurisdictions. Another area not included in the Bill is the treatment of mentally disordered people before the courts and in custody. This is an extremely complex issue which will take some time to resolve. It involves other Departments and agencies. I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for the timing of car tests under the new national car test were notified in regulations and announcements made by my Department in December 1998. These involve both the establishment of a two-yearly testing cycle for cars over four years old and the spreading of the test dates among vehicles designated for testing in a particular year. The latter requirement is being achieved by approximating the test due date to the anniversary of the first registration of a vehicle. Car owners have also, however, been given the flexi<Col N="1055" /> bility of arranging for a test date up to 60 days prior to the due date.</P>
      <P>The Society for the Irish Motor Industry &ndash; SIMI &ndash; made representations to my Department in February 2000 that testing should be permitted even in advance of these arrangements so as to facilitate trading of second-hand cars. My Department met the SIMI to hear its case following which a written proposal was received from the SIMI on 25 February. The SIMI proposal would have considerable implications for the organisation and management of the national car test, including possible additional costs for the contractor and the public. My Department is, therefore, consulting with the National Car Testing Service Ltd.</P>
      <P>In completing its assessment, my Department will have to consider whether the changes proposed, which would have to be made available on an unrestricted basis, would in overall terms produce benefits outweighing costs. The potential for innovative commercial responses by the motor industry to present arrangements, such as vehicle test guarantees already provided in some countries, must also be borne in mind. My Department expects to be in a position shortly to revert to the SIMI on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is the Minister considering this matter in a positive light? Does he agree with the principle that it is worthwhile creating a situation where purchasers of second-hand cars that have not yet reached the required anniversary date of their first registration should be entitled to the assurance they could be given if they were able to buy fully tested and conforming cars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Deputy, I will not go any further than stating that I am giving the SIMI the courtesy of carefully considering its proposals. I would not go as far as saying that my position is positive or negative at this stage. However, I accept the Deputy's point about the assurance that could be given to people buying second-hand cars which face being tested. I am inclined to take the view that the SIMI and its members should consider this matter on a broader front. It has more to gain from offering guarantees than the NCTS.</P>
      <P>Taking the route suggested by the SIMI would have cost and contract implications. I must be honest with the Deputy and state that I would be reluctant to move in a direction which would lead to an increased cost for motorists for testing. Taking such a route would mean a change in the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be rigorous in the way in which he deals with this matter? NCTS may claim that there would be increased costs, but they would be short-term. Does the Minister agree that once the first hump involved in the initial testing is overcome, NCTS will have a <Col N="1056" /> much more predictable volume of business? Does he also agree it would be possible for it to plan for the extra business that would be involved without getting into a situation where there would be an extra cost per unit?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider whether there might be some advantages for the test operators in economies of scale? Although I appreciate his sentiments, I ask him to worry less about being fair to me and to give greater consideration to being fair to the people who buy second-hand cars. Will he put the emphasis on that area? Will he also consider that in making it possible to give this type of guarantee to the buyers of second-hand cars, he would be acting in a way that reinforces the Government's real concern about road safety? He would be acting in a way which responds to the feeling we all share that any measures that can be reasonably taken to improve road safety would be worth taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that one of the major reasons for the introduction of the test was to increase the safety of vehicles on the road. I share that aspiration with the Deputy. I am keen to be fair to people buying second hand cars and I presume the members of the SIMI would also like to keep this to the forefront.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a nice, non-costly way for the SIMI to get the national agency to do it. There are schemes in the UK where guarantees in relation to the national test are offered. They are offered by the industry, not the car test agency.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the findings of the national waste database report for 1995-98 produced by the Environmental Protection Agency; the proposals, if any, he has to deal with the waste crisis in view of the fact the level of waste almost doubled in the period surveyed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency warns that care must be taken in making comparisons between the findings of the national waste database report for 1998 and those of the preceding report for 1995 as it can be difficult to determine the extent to which variations in data reflect real developments or are a function of improved reporting and methodology.</P>
      <P>For example, it is not correct to suggest that waste arisings doubled in the period from 1995 to 1998. Estimated waste arisings in 1998 amounted to some 80 million tonnes, but this included nearly 20 million tonnes of dirty water from the dairy sector which had not been taken into account in the 1995 database. The 1998 total also reflects a significant change in the method of calculation of arisings of animal manures and slurries, which amounted to over 40 million tonnes.</P>
      <P>While a degree of estimation and extrapolation is necessarily involved in developing data on waste generation, the trends in the period 1995 to 1998 seem clear. The EPA's findings point to increasing waste generation in most of the main categories, reflecting, <i>inter alia</i>, the economic growth and improved manufacturing and industrial performance of recent years. Overall, the EPA estimates that non-agricultural waste arisings increased by 37% to over 15 million tonnes.</P>
      <P>The volume of waste recycled and otherwise recovered has increased substantially in real terms, from about 900,000 tonnes in 1995 to over 2.5 million tonnes in 1998. However, because waste arisings have also increased significantly, overall waste recovery rates have not substantially improved.</P>
      <P>The 1998 report clearly underlines the challenge inherent in meeting the Government's targets for the recovery and disposal of waste set out in the policy statement, Changing our Ways, and the need to press ahead with the adoption and vigorous implementation of the local and regional waste management plans that are currently being finalised. These provide for practical measures to minimise municipal and industrial waste generation as well as the development of improved waste services and an integrated waste management infrastructure. Their implementation will have a major impact on our waste recovery performance.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, provides for capital investment of £650 million to support the delivery of improved waste management services and infrastructure. Of this, £100 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> Our national environmental awareness programme, supported by measures at local level, will raise the issue of waste minimisation in the public consciousness but, in addition, more direct action will be necessary. Delivery of regional and local waste management plans will be complemented and expedited by an increasing focus by Government on fiscal and other measures to prevent and minimise waste generation and directly influence business practice and public consumption patterns.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>It is the intention to expand upon the policy issues and guidance in Changing our Ways with the publication this year of a new policy statement on waste minimisation, recycling and recovery. This will outline the scope of measures to be undertaken in the interests of a sustained improvement in our recycling performance and the findings of the 1998 national database report will have a major bearing on this policy development.</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the Minister's efforts to talk down the seriousness of the EPA's report, which shows that waste is growing at a rate of approximately 12.5% per year, what action does he intend to take to deal with this country's growing waste crisis? Local authorities are taking different courses of action in respect of this area. Some of them are privatising their waste collection and disposal services, some charge different rates for these services and others are considering the establishment of new dumps or the construction of incinerators. In the interim, the waste mountain is growing. What does the Minister for the Environment and Local Government propose to do to deal with this country's growing waste crisis and to bring to bear a degree of national strategy in respect of the management of our waste problem and solutions thereto?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I intervened in this area in October 1998 following my discovery that the Waste Management Act, 1996, advocated an approach to waste management based on local authority areas, which was clearly inadequate. I quickly realised on entering office that there was a need to take a more regional approach to resolve difficulties in this area. It was for that reason that we produced our policy document, Changing our Ways, in 1998 which gave the lead to local authorities to approach waste management in an integrated and regional way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost all local authorities are currently involved in a consultation phase regarding regional waste management strategies. These strategies which are now being put in place are designed to fully implement the policy I outlined in October 1998 in respect of waste prevention, where possible, minimisation, reuse, recycling, including composting and the separation and seg<Col N="1059" /> regation of waste, and safe final disposal. As already stated, the authorities are in the middle of a consultation phase but, when the strategies are put in place, they will have a significant effect on the problem of waste and waste management.</P>
    <P>I must contradict Deputy Gilmore because at no stage did I try to talk down the EPA's report. However, I am obliged to point out what is accurate, what may have been exaggerated etc. I agree with the Deputy that a serious problem exists in relation to waste and waste management.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>the percentage of landlords who have registered with their relevant local authority in order to comply with the provisions of the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10377/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996, lies with local authorities. The most recent information supplied by the authorities indicates that on 30 September 1999, 15,322 landlords had registered 26,111 properties, compared to 13,200 registrations of 23,960 properties on 31 December 1998. My Department does not have information on the total number of landlords or dwellings to which the regulations apply.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to put in place the necessary arrangements for their effective implementation. I am anxious to see full compliance with the regulations and in this regard my Department has urged local authorities to take all available measures necessary to ensure that landlords comply with the regulations. Local authorities have also been requested to put in place procedures for prompt and effective follow-up action in relation to any inquiries, complaints or breaches of the regulations.</P>
      <P>In fairness to local authorities, it must be said that their capacity to enforce the regulations was adversely affected by successful court challenges by landlords to the enforcement procedures. While progress is again being made in implementation of the regulations, more needs to be done before we can be satisfied that the regulations are being satisfactorily implemented. Ways to further assist the local authorities in this regard are being pursued, including provisions in this year's Social Welfare Act which will enable health boards to provide information to local authorities regarding tenancies supported through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the recent Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000, remove the exemption from the require<Col N="1060" /> ment to register, which had applied to lettings of temporary convenience or to meet a temporary necessity. These regulations will remove certain legal difficulties arising from a High Court judgment concerning an action taken by a local authority against a number of landlords who had failed to register their properties. I am confident that these regulations, with the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, will considerably strengthen the hand of the local authorities in implementing the registration requirement.</P>

      <P>Given that the latest census figures show that there are in excess of 100,000 housing units in this sector, will the Minister confirm that between 70% and 80% of those units have not been registered, as they must be under law, because landlords have failed to do so? Does the Minister not accept that his cavalier approach and that of the Minister of State with responsibility for social housing is contributing to the black economy because landlords are refusing to register due to the fact that they are obliged to pay tax on registered properties?</P>

    <P>It is for the local authorities to pursue the registration. They get registration fees. We have encouraged and pursued them in this regard.

      <P>The results of the assessments of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March last year indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. In addition, the housing needs of a further 6,400 households were considered by local authorities as being most suitably met by other measures including voluntary housing, rent supplementation and other social housing schemes. Details of the results of the assessment were placed in the Oireachtas Library on 5 October last.</P>
      <P>Last November local authorities were notified of their allocations of housing starts for the period 2000-03. I expect that local authorities will commence the construction of, or acquire, in excess of 5,500 houses this year and that the level of house completions, including acquisitions, will be in excess of 4,000 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of introducing a multi-annual local authority housing programme was to enable them to produce a streamlined delivery of hous<Col N="1062" /> ing output over the coming four years and a better and more effective mechanism of social housing delivery. Previously, local authorities had no assurance as to the level of their programme beyond the current year, which led to inefficiency in terms of timing and scale of contracts and forward planning generally. Local authorities were asked to front load their programmes as much as possible to meet higher levels of housing need. The indications from work programmes furnished to my Department are that we will achieve an accelerated output level and I am confident local authorities will commence or acquire in excess of 5,500 units this year. Up to 850 of these will be purchased.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given in tackling it. I expect that total social housing output, taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in the existing housing stock and output from the complementary social and voluntary housing measures, will meet the housing needs of some 11,000 households in need of social housing this year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of more than 50,000 households. My Department will support local authorities and will co-operate in every way with them to help them achieve their housing programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received proposals from a local authority seeking funding for a pilot project scheme to purchase land to develop a planned town. Local authorities are being encouraged by my Department to acquire the land required to meet the social and affordable housing output targets identified in the national development plan and more particularly to meet the target of 22,000 housing starts in the multi-annual local authority housing programme for the period 2000-03.</P>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency assists local authorities with loan finance for housing land acquisition. The cost of any land acquisition used for the development of local authority housing, together with any holding charges incurred for up to five years, is funded by the housing capital allocations from my Department. Broadly similar arrangements apply in respect of the other social and affordable housing schemes.</P>
      <P>Any development of green field sites for housing or of &ldquo;new towns&rdquo; should have regard to proper planning considerations. Strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area were published in March 1999 and are currently being reviewed and updated. Similar studies are ongoing in the other major urban centres. These guidelines provide for a co-ordinated approach to land use, infrastructural provision and housing development.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Many developers have purchased large tracts of land, especially in the counties surrounding Dublin, including the Minster's county, over a long period of time in anticipation that they would be serviced. As a result they are dictating to local authorities what land should be zoned and developed. This is the case in my county. Ulti<Col N="1064" /> mately, these developers make large profits which are passed on to the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in view of what has happened in Kilbride in his county, local authorities should consider the idea of buying 200 or 300 acres on green field sites with a view to developing them for local authority and private housing? Does he also agree that if this were to happen it would not be necessary to make huge profits and would act as a fly in the ointment to developers because they would be unsure where to purchase land in the future? Drastic situations require drastic remedies and perhaps the Minister might be innovative in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to look at any proposals by local authorities or others to increase the housing supply. A proposal along the lines the Deputy suggested would have to fit in with the proper planning and development of an area. The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area will influence and shape the development plans in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath. It is not as simple as a local authority deciding to go into an area and buying 300 acres of land to create a town or village. As long as proposals conform to the development plans and to the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area they will be considered.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think it is acceptable that land in south County Dublin, which had an agricultural value of £17,000 a number of years ago, will be sold this week for £17 million, as was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>? Is it acceptable that the tract of land referred to in Kilbride, which was apparently bought for £6 million, is now worth £100 million? What measures will the Minister introduce to deal with that level of speculation in land prices which is driving up the price of houses and putting them beyond the reach of many families? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to discuss some of the measures I am introducing to provide land for housing at a reasonable cost during Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill next week. The land to which he referred in Kilbride will only be worth £100 million if the person concerned gets planning permission for it. That is not certain, particularly if people take into account the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there would be advantages from cost, social mix and servicing points of view in encouraging the clustering of development around villages rather than the type of scattered development we see in the countryside which is causing problems for many local authorities? Does he agree that it would be <Col N="1065" /> worthwhile for himself and his Department to look at means of encouraging local authorities to approach development on that basis and thereby have viable communities in small villages throughout the countryside? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of any type of sustainable development or any proposal which complies with the proper planning and development of an area, although it does not necessarily need to come to me. What Deputy Dukes said is at the heart of what we are talking about in the strategic planning guidelines. The Deputy is right; it would be more effective, efficient and sustainable and a better use of resources if we concentrate developments on existing settlements rather than scattering them. We will encourage local authorities to pursue that policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 4 on today's Order Paper in relation to the assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March.</P>
      <P>The total number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 1999 was approximately 3,700. Details will be included in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin for 1999 which is due to be published shortly by my Department. Local authorities were notified of their authorised programmes for the coming four years on 25 November. The programme provides for a total of 22,000 houses to be constructed or acquired in the period 2000 to 2003. I expect that authorities will commence the construction of or acquire in excess of 5,500 houses this year and that the level of house completions, including acquisitions, will be in excess of 4,000 units. Figures in relation to the number of starts/completions for the first quarter of 2000 are currently being compiled.</P>
      <P>The local authority housing programme is only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met. I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with the output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of 11,000 households to be met this year compared to 9,300 last year. My Department will support and co-operate in every way with local authorities to help them achieve their housing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that at a time when in excess of 40,000 families are waiting for a local authority house, 5,500 new starts this year is pathetic and an indictment of the Government's performance to date in building local authority housing? Does he also accept that since coming to office the number of new local authority homes has dwindled compared to the number of private homes and that this has been a consistent feature of Fianna Fáil policy over the years? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>One can talk about lies, damned lies and statistics and Deputy Hayes has given statistics on the dwindling number of local authority houses compared to the number of private houses. The total capital provision for the local authority housing programme this year is £312 million, which is an increase of £82 million or 36% on the 1999 provision, £98 million or 46% on the 1998 provision and £137 million or 79% on the 1997 provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister factored in total Government spending? The figure is reducing. The Minister should ask the Minister for Finance&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost 100% more than the 1996 provision. That speaks for itself. The fact we <Col N="1067" /> have brought forward the multi-annual programmes to allow the local authorities to plan ahead is also an indication of our commitment. The fact we have £6 billion for the first time in the national development plan is a fair and clear indication of the Government's commitment to ensure that the needs of local authorities and those on local authority housing waiting lists will be met. I remind the Deputy that we are talking about looking after the needs of 11,000 households, not 5,500, this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there are more people on local authority housing waiting lists now than there were this time last year and that there will be more people left on local authority waiting lists this time next year on the basis of the programme he has again outlined? Does he also accept that the output and performance of local authorities in delivering housing allocations is poor and that the number of completions each year falls far short of the number of dwellings allocated? What is his expectation for the number of housing completions in 2000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The output of local authorities and the number of completions have been raised by the Minister of State and by me in recent years. For that reason we took on the concept of multi-annual programmes. Some local authorities were having difficulty getting builders to build small estates &ndash; the emphasis is increasingly on smaller estates rather than the huge sprawling estates that were built previously &ndash; in the current buoyant construction market and when they got builders there was a problem holding onto them. The concept of the multi-annual programme was introduced as a response to those difficulties.</P>
      <P>It was also a response to the disappointing returns. I agree with the Deputy that the output of local authorities fell short over the last number of years. I looked at the figures for the years since 1993 and in each year they did not reach their completion targets. We were trying to address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What action does the Minister propose to take against local authorities who cannot build the number of start-ups they are allocated each year? The total amount of expenditure on housing is increasing but does the Minister agree with the view of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who told me in reply to a parliamentary question that the provision for social housing as a percentage of total Government spending has reduced from 10% in the mid-1980s to approximately 7% today? Is that not another example of the indictment I mentioned earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of taking action against local authorities might seem attractive but what <Col N="1068" /> does one do? Penalise them financially? I often feel frustrated that there are no sanctions against the local authorities when something is not done. On a positive note, however, we have asked them to let us know as soon as possible if they believe they are not going to meet their targets and allocations for this year. If they do that, we can reallocate to other local authorities. We have given a guarantee that it will not reduce their allocations in future years. Difficulties can arise. We are trying to encourage local authorities to let us know the position in time. Previously, local authorities waited until November or December to inform the Department that they could not meet their programme targets. That meant we could not reallocate the moneys.</P>
      <P>We offer every assistance and back-up to the local authorities in terms of cutting out red tape and bureaucracy. We have also increased the threshold limits for unit costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the scale of house building that will be required, whether or not it is approved by this Government, to provide homes for people, perhaps a different way might have to be found to deliver that output. It could be done through a national housing authority, for example, or another vehicle. In relation to the expected output for 2000, how many houses have been completed so far and how many are currently under construction? Those figures will indicate the number of likely completions. When will the housing statistics bulletin for the last quarter of 1999 be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics sought by the Deputy will be available shortly. The figures on the starts and completions for the first quarter of 2000 are currently being compiled and I expect them to be published in the next quarterly bulletin which is due this month. The same applies to the other figures sought by the Deputy. I do not have the figures with me now but if the Deputy puts down a relevant question for the next Question Time they will probably be available then. They will be compiled at that stage in relation to completions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister be a little more muscular in his approach to the completion rates of local authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> their targets? Can he ensure that his Department notifies local authorities earlier about their allocations for a given year? The Minister is aware of the problem in this regard. In November or December local authorities often still do not know their allocation for the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When his Department is making decisions on the allocations, can it not adopt a more rigorous approach and ensure that when local authorities put plans forward they have the necessary services, sites and contracts in place? Everybody knows that if a local authority does not have its plans put together properly in October of a given year, it will not have the houses completed by <Col N="1069" /> December of the following year. If there were a more rigorous approach, there would be a better distribution of the allocation to local authorities that can perform and deliver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's points are valid. With multi-annual programmes the Deputy's suggestions would be easier to facilitate than heretofore. Once the local authorities know the allocation, they can go through the procedures for the full number of houses they intend to build over the next four years in a particular place. That will cut down on a great deal of the red tape associated with this process. The Deputy is right in relation to how soon the local authorities know their allocations. They now know them for the next three years. This will give rise to better completion rates and more accurate predictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiative to encourage voter participation, which was agreed as part of the discussions on a new national agreement, arose in the context of the ongoing review of electoral law in my Department and also from contact I have had with the National Youth Council of Ireland regarding its recommendations in this area. I have made reference to these matters in the House in recent times and I will now examine how best to progress this commitment over the coming months as part of the ongoing review of electoral law.</P>
      <P>Issues which are being considered in the review include changes in the registration process and the development of an extended advertising campaign to encourage registration and voting. I will also look at the recommendations of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution arising from its examination of the institutions of State, when these are available, and I will review the provision of information at referendums. In addition, I believe that extending the use of photographs on ballot papers to the remaining polls in the light of the experience at the European elections in 1999 and the introduction of electronic voting and counting, both of which are currently under examination, also have the potential to make a positive contribution to promoting increased participation in the electoral process.</P>

The Minister listed a number of matters including the registration process, advertising campaigns, the report of the committee on the Constitution and information on referendums. Is he not trying to pull the wool over our eyes by telling us that these things, which have been discussed in the House at various times over the last 19 years of my membership, are being dressed up as the electoral participation initiative in the PPF?

      <P>Since this issue arose in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, does the Minister accept that the individual worker, who has to leave home at maybe 7 a.m. or 7.30 a.m. in order to beat Dublin traffic and who perhaps does not get home until 7 p.m. or 7.30 p.m., has at most an hour or an hour and half in which they can go out to cast their vote? That is, of course, if they are not like many other workers who have to work away from home on the day of the election. Will the Minister consider introducing an arrangement for polling day, either at weekends or perhaps over two days, so that the average worker, whose taxes are keeping the State going, can exercise their democratic right to vote which they are being denied at the moment by virtue of the nature of their work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector has been asked to report by 1 June of this year. The Government has in the past two years provided significant additional support and protections for people in private rented residential accommodation. Substantial increases in tax relief for tenants renting private rented accommodation were announced in the budget last December and take effect today.</P>
      <P>Targeted incentives for the provision of student accommodation were introduced in the Finance Act, 1999. I am pleased to say that some 1,100 places will be available by October of this year and over 7,500 places are at various stages of planning.</P>
      <P>The protection afforded to tenants under the registration of rented houses regulations has also been improved. In January last, the regulations were amended to provide that the onus is now on the landlord to prove that a dwelling is exempt from the requirements of the regulations and to remove the exemption from the regulations on the grounds that the letting is of a temporary convenience nature. Registration now applies to every house let as a dwelling for rent or other valuable consideration, subject to limited exceptions.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector will be examined carefully and I expect that the commission's recommendations will provide a firm basis for the future development of this key housing sector.</P>

      <P>It will come as a great surprise to the many tenants that the Government has been doing something to improve their lot. Does the <Col N="1073" /> Minister accept that the initiatives that have been taken have benefited the landlord rather than the tenant and that the experience of the tenant over the past three years of his tenure in office has been of increasing rents and greater vulnerability in rented accommodation? Is the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector on target to report on 1 June? When will the Minister introduce in the House legislative changes recommended by the commission which, as is widely accepted by anybody who knows anything about the private rented sector, are long overdue?</P>

      <P>On the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, I am told that it is on target and that the people involved have been diligent in their approach. They are representative of a broad cross-section of people &ndash; landlords, legal people and so on. As to the action which will be taken as a result, the Government will consider the commission's recommendations carefully and will put them into effect as quickly as is humanly possible. That commitment has existed since the commission was established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes a good point. Probably for historical reasons landlord-tenant legislation in this country and attitudes on both sides seem to emanate more from the previous century or the century before than this one. The Deputy is correct in what he says about that type of approach. All these issues are being considered by the commission. There has been a great deal of good, lively debate on it. What must be done, and we have discovered this to our cost, is that the two sets of rights in this case must be balanced &ndash; those of the tenant and those of the landlord. The approach suggested by the Deputy, where that balance would be kept but greater security of tenure would be provided for the tenant and perhaps also for the landlord, would be immensely helpful in the current climate.</P>

What we need is a separate body to regulate the private rented sector and enforce standards. In my local authority one person is charged with this responsibility for 25,000 to 30,000 houses.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking office the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I have made litter eradication a priority. As part of our initiatives in this area, the National Anti-Litter Forum established last July has been tasked with reviewing existing anti-litter actions and developing a programme of measures to enhance and extend these actions. I understand that good progress has been made by the forum in its work and that its report will be submitted shortly to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>As regards An Taisce's project, National Spring Clean 2000, my Department is contributing £140,000 towards the estimated overall cost of £230,000 for this year's campaign. The balance of the cost is being met through commercial sponsorship. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I co-hosted the formal launch of National Spring Clean 2000 last Monday in Dublin Castle. National spring clean is an innovative and ambitious project which deserves our support as part of the national effort to tackle litter pollution in this country.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I are pursuing other anti-litter initiatives, including doubling the on-the-spot fine to £50; allocating almost £1 million to local authorities for anti-litter initiatives in the past three years &ndash; a similar grant scheme will operate in 2000; approving the development of a national monitoring system to assess local authority anti-litter action &ndash; the system will be fully implemented over coming months; writing recently to all Ministers and Ministers of State enlisting their support for anti-litter action and urging that all Departments and agencies take the necessary steps to keep lands and properties under their control litter free and continuing strong personal support at many fora, conferences and launches of local litter campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary responsibility for tackling litter pollution, including clean-up measures, rests with local authorities. Many local authorities are using the extended powers available to them under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, to take a more proac<Col N="1076" /> tive approach to combating litter. This is reflected in the statistics on local authority enforcement action available in the Oireachtas Library which demonstrate significant improvement since 1997. Clearly there is no room for complacency. Local authority anti-litter performance must continue to improve and extend to all authorities. I will continue to convey my views on this matter directly to elected members and managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that, given the scale of the litter problem in this country and the resources available to the Government, £140,000 nationally for an anti-litter campaign and £1 million for anti-litter initiatives over three years is Mickey Mouse money and is an indication that the Government is not serious about dealing with litter and is probably contributing to rather than solving the problem by the amount of paper generated in discussing it rather than dealing with it? Will the Minister of State direct local authorities to recruit a significant number of additional litter wardens so that there can be a massive drive at enforcing the Litter Pollution Act? Will he accept that local authorities are not meeting their own obligations under that Act to keep streets and public places free of litter and to do the routine job which every county and urban council in the country always did, which was to get out with the brush and shovel, clean the streets and keep areas free from litter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is misleading to suggest that only £140,000 is being allocated for litter. Some £26 million nationally has been allocated for cleansing, litter wardens and so on. In the Dublin Corporation area alone the budget for cleansing and litter wardens was increased from £10 million the year before last to £11 million last year and the number of litter wardens was increased from two to 20. The corporation has a seven day, 24 hour a day service with 11 mobile units.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there should be more litter wardens. In 1997 there were 29 full-time and 56 part-time wardens. We now have 60 full-time wardens and 238 part-time wardens.</P>
      <P>There are now almost 300 wardens which we did not have just over two years ago. I share the Deputy's concern but I do not need to direct local authorities on this issue. It is within their remit to employ wardens.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that we do not have the funds to tackle this problem. Litter wardens are self financing but the will does not exist in some councils. I pay tribute to some local authorities. Last month I wrote to every manager and local authority member appealing to them to pursue their local authorities on their litter management plans. Have those plans been assessed or updated recently? Are local authorities ensuring that the plans are being implemented and that laws passed by this House are being enforced? This issue will be resolved at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would need many shovels and brushes to deal with the situation which occurred after the <Col N="1077" /> St. Patrick's weekend in Dublin. People are breaking the law and we must all play our part to stop it. The Minister and I have given every support and I appeal to every local authority member and Member of this House to support the National Spring Clean in April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood him correctly, the Minister of State said that one of the things he would do would be assess the anti-litter actions of local authorities. What does that mean? Is he aware that streets in every city, town and village are dirtier on Saturday and Sunday mornings than at any other time of the week, yet local authorities make less effort to clean up at that time than during the rest of the week? If he is serious about assessing the anti-litter actions of local authorities, will he tell them that they need to deploy greater resources on Saturday and Sunday mornings than during the rest of the week? This might be a good start to his spring clean campaign.</P>

      <P>I have been to Athy and we had a good experience there when we complimented all concerned. I was delighted the Deputy turned up and the Minister and I will be very active during April. I hope Deputy Gilmore will lead the National Spring Clean campaign. An Taisce and the National Spring Clean did a tremendous job last year when they collected more than 7,000 tonnes of rubbish. The target is 10,000 tonnes this year. We all owe it to them to give them our support. The campaign only lasts for a month but where there is a will there is a way. The strength is in local authorities implementing the legislation introduced by the previous Government. It is good legislation.</P>

      <P>We must ensure that local authorities carry out their enforcement functions. We have education awareness programmes and that is important but we must work together to deal with this problem. The Government, the Minister and I are determined to eradicate the problem of litter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree with the suggestion by my party colleague on Dublin Corporation, Councillor Humphries, that those on whom litter fines are imposed should be named and shamed publicly? Does he also agree that we need to get to a point where there is heightened public awareness of the problem of litter and measures taken to, if nothing else, <Col N="1078" /> embarrass people to stop them littering our streets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This practice already exists in other areas. We must do everything to bring home to people their responsibility for dealing with this issue. The problem costs £26 million annually. This is unnecessary spending which could be diverted to other areas to provide much needed facilities at local level. The demands on local resources need not happen if people become aware that we all have a responsibility and we all have a role to play. What happened in Dublin over the St. Patrick's weekend was unnecessary and unacceptable. People must realise that they have an individual responsibility. If we approach the problem in this way I am confident we can make inroads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies seem to be suggesting that the fixed interest rates applicable to SDA housing loans be reduced to a rate of 4.5% which is close to the current variable rate of 4.25% in line with market rates. Current fixed interest rates are considerably higher including those on local authority housing loans which are set at 6.75% for a period of five years.</P>
      <P>The higher fixed interest rates of 12.5% to 7% referred to by the Deputies relate to loans advanced in the 1970s up to the mid 1980s which reflected the cost of long-term funds available at that time. Since 1980, borrowers have been free to redeem fixed interest rate loans without penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This is a very significant concession, the cost of which must be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities. Borrowers with commercial lending institutions are, on the other hand, obliged to pay significant redemption penalties of up to six months interest or more in the event of early redemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's review of An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to target support to home owners with high fixed interest rate local authority loans. This commitment reflects the Government's concern for <Col N="1079" /> those borrowers who are unable to redeem such loans due to their inability to refinance in the private sector. My Department is in contact with the Department of Finance with a view to putting in place measures to implement the Government's commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister allow county councils to reduce the rates charged from the current penal rate of 12%? No other lending agency charges anything like 12%. A sum of £193 million is involved in these loans, of which just under £80 million is charged at 12%. How can the Minister say that these loans can be redeemed without penalty?</P>
      <P>The initial principal borrowed in the majority of loans was between £8,000 to £12,000. With a little goodwill the Minister could alleviate the problem by providing £12 million to reduce the rates. If anyone attempts to redeem or re-finance these loans they will incur a penal cost of about £2,000 due to legal and other costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a special category of people who have been refused loans by all other agencies. They are the new poor, despite the fact that they have a valuable residence. They are being severely penalised and I hope the Minister will seriously consider providing £12 million to reduce the rate from the current penal level of 12%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government gave a commitment in the review of the action programme to try to target support to home owners with fixed high interest local authority loans. We are in contact with the Department of Finance to see if we can advance this issue.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the assertion that a financial institution, private or otherwise, would lend money at a fixed rate and reduce it thereafter.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached at a particular time in the loans in question. Previous Governments and this Government have been generous in allowing people to redeem the loans without penalty and refinance them in the private sector. For those on fixed incomes we will try to do this. I am not sure where Deputy Ulick Burke got his figures in relation to the 12.5%. My information states that the balance outstanding in respect of 12.5% fixed interest loans at the end of 1999 was £67 million, 40% of the total amount of £164.7 million outstanding for the local loan funds and SDA loans.</P>

We have a responsibility to help the tenants on housing estates who want to purchase their own homes. They are a great source of stability in <Col N="1080" /> some of the toughest housing estates. By implementing this proposal, we could help local authorities to reduce their maintenance costs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, which I am introducing today, is most important legislation and deals with an area which is of the greatest public concern to an overwhelming majority of the community. The Bill is also a cornerstone of the Government's unyielding response to those who perpetrate sexual offences and those sexual pred<Col N="1081" /> ators in our community. Its provisions are tough and uncompromising but I make no apology to anyone for that. This House must send out the strongest possible message to those in our community who prey on the vulnerable, those unable to defend themselves and, of course, our children. The message, which is at the heart of this Bill, is that the criminal justice system will not tolerate their behaviour, will deal with them swiftly and severely and the public will be protected from their vile activities.</P>
    <P>I take no particular pleasure in having to introduce in this House strong measures such as those contained in this Bill. We owe it, however, to the people we serve to take the steps, introduce the measures and amend the law to ensure that their safety, the safety of their families and, in particular, the safety of their children remains a paramount priority for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to introduce a register of sex offenders and that commitment was reiterated in the mid-term review of the programme. In May 1998, I published a discussion paper on the law on sexual offences in order to canvass opinions on a range of issues, including a registration requirement for convicted sex offenders. There was strong support for the concept of registration and the Bill has been drafted in the light of the detailed comments that we received on how a registration requirement should work in practice.</P>
    <P>The protection of the vulnerable in society is a top priority for the Government. Sex offenders prey on other people, particularly those unable to defend themselves, and their actions can leave their victims scarred for life. Recent tragic cases have brought home to all of us the risk posed to children by paedophiles. There is a clear need for additional measures to strengthen the arrangements already in place to protect the public from sex offenders. The provisions of this Bill, along with recent legislative and other measures, should provide reassurance to the public that whatever can be done to tackle the problems posed by paedophiles and others who pose a risk to vulnerable people will be done.</P>
    <P>I mentioned other legislative measures. To appreciate fully the importance of this Bill, it must be viewed as a further stage in the strategy of using the criminal law, in so far as it is possible, to protect persons against sex abuse and attack. There is no need for me to detail here all the relevant reforming legislation of the 1990s but two Acts in particular require mention to place this Bill in its proper context. The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, the outcome of a Private Members' Bill I published in 1995, ensured that persons resident in Ireland could be prosecuted for sexual offences committed against children while abroad. The trafficking measures in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, protected children from being trafficked into, out of or through Ireland for the purposes of their sexual exploitation. That Bill also crimi<Col N="1082" /> nalised the creation, distribution and possession of child pornography. The Bill we are now discussing takes the next logical step of protecting vulnerable persons from abuse, attack or the threat of harm from persons who have already been convicted of a sexual offence and who might re-offend.</P>
    <P>One thing all three legislative measures recognise is that international borders offer no protection to offenders or would be abusers. Taken together, the legislation more than meets our international obligations in this area and I would urge other countries to bring in similar measures so that the typically devious and manipulative child sex offender will know no hiding place.</P>
    <P>The central purpose of the Bill is to impose a requirement on certain sex offenders to notify the Garda Síochána of their names and addresses and any changes to that information to ensure that the Garda Síochána records in that respect are kept fully up to date. The Bill also proposes other important protections. It provides for a new civil court order against sex offenders whose behaviour in the community gives the Garda Síochána reasonable cause for concern that the order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. It creates a new offence for sex offenders who seek or accept work involving unsupervised contact with children without informing the employer of their conviction. It provides for the post-release supervision of sex offenders by the probation and welfare service and it introduces separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases during applications to adduce evidence or cross-examine on the complainant's past sexual experience.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the main provisions of the Bill in more detail. Part II of the Bill sets out how the new tracking or notification system for convicted sex offenders will work. The system I propose will ensure that the Garda Síochána will have up to date information at all times on the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders. This, in itself, should act as a deterrent to re-offending and so contribute to their rehabilitation. In addition, the availability of up to date data will be of particular benefit to the Garda in the prevention and investigation of sexual crimes. The system will be similar in some respects to those already in operation in Britain and the USA and is generally referred to as a tracking or notification system. The benefits to the Garda and the public in such a system greatly outweigh the relatively minor inconvenience the notification obligation would impose on convicted sex offenders.</P>
    <P>The notification obligation would cover all those who, on or after commencement, are convicted or found guilty but insane of a sexual offence specified in the Schedules of the Bill, and those who are, on commencement, still in contact with the criminal justice system, whether awaiting sentence, in prison, subject to supervision, serving a community service order or detained in the Central Mental Hospital. The duration of the notification requirement will depend on the <Col N="1083" /> length of sentence as follows &ndash; a minimum five year period for those convicte and sentenced to a non-custodial sentence, including a fully suspended sentence, a seven year period for those sentenced to a custodial sentence of six months or less, a ten year period for those sentenced to a custodial sentence of between six months and two years and an indefinite period or lifetime notification requirement for those sentenced to more than two years.</P>
    <P>The finite periods are halved in the case of offenders who are under 18 years of age at the time of sentencing.</P>
    <P>Notification periods start from the date of conviction. The following system will operate. The Garda will be notified by court certificate on conviction that an offender is subject to the notification requirement. This will allow for rapid updating of the Garda Síochána records. The minimum five year period will be taken as applying until sentence is passed, at which stage the Garda Síochána will be notified by the issue of a further certificate by the court of the sentence passed, which will dictate the duration of the notification requirement. The details which an offender must notify to the Garda Síochána are his or her name, any other name used and his or her address. Should these details change, for example, in the case of the offender moving address, he or she must notify the Garda Síochána of the new details. The offender must also notify the Garda Síochána of any address where he or she stays for a period of ten days or more, or two or more periods amounting to ten days in the aggregate, in any period of 12 months. Notification can be made in person at a district or divisional Garda station or in writing to such a station.</P>
    <P>The notification requirement also applies to persons when they go abroad for ten days or more. This will allow the Garda to know whether the person has gone abroad or gone underground in this country, a potentially serious situation. The notification requirement will also apply to qualifying offences committed abroad. Persons who commit offences abroad pose the same risk to vulnerable persons in this country or a greater risk if they are fleeing an obligation to notify in another country. Failure to notify or false notification is a summary offence punishable by a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both.</P>
    <P>Persons who will be subject to a lifetime notification requirement are being given the option of applying to the court, not less than ten years following their release from prison, to be relieved of their obligation to notify the Garda of changes to their name or address. The court can so relieve them if it is satisfied that the common good is no longer served by their continuing obligation to notify.</P>
    <P>The offences that will trigger the notification requirement are all those sexual offences committed against children. However, the list is widely <Col N="1084" /> drawn, including certain offences such as rape, aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault that know no age limits. Section 3 sets out certain exclusions from the notification requirements of the Act. These exclusions include consensual sexual intercourse with persons aged between 15 and 17 where the guilty party is aged not more than three years older than the other party. Even though such activity is criminal behaviour and will continue to be so, it may have occurred as part of a relationship and the offender will not usually pose a future risk.</P>
    <P>Part III provides for a new civil order, which will be known as a sex offender order. This order may be granted, on application to the court by the Garda Síochána, against any convicted sex offender whose behaviour in the community, though not strictly criminal, gives the Garda cause for concern that an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him or her. &ldquo;Serious harm&rdquo;, which is defined in section 15, means protecting the public or a member of the public from death or serious personal injury, whether physical or psychological. Orders can be sought against anyone with a previous conviction for an offence which is included in the Schedule or the equivalent offences overseas. The order is prohibitory in nature and will last for a minimum of five years or such longer period as the court may provide for in the order. The prohibitions contained in the order will be limited to those which are necessary for the purpose of protecting the public from serious harm by the offender.</P>
    <P>The court will not be able to compel a person to do anything, only not to do certain things, for example, loitering in the vicinity of a school playground or other place where children congregate. The particular activity may not be remarkable were it not for the offender's past history of offending. While there is a delicate balance to be struck between the rights of the defendant and the need to protect the community, the need for such an order is dictated by the importance of protecting the public, in particular its most vulnerable members. While the orders are preventative only, once granted they carry the notification requirements of Part II while they are in effect, where such requirements do not already exist. In this way, potentially dangerous sex offenders whose offending is in the past and who are not otherwise covered by the notification requirement, will be made subject to that requirement for the duration of the sex offender order, that is, for a minimum period of at least five years. Breach of an order without reasonable excuse is a criminal offence triable either way with a maximum penalty on indictment of five years in prison.</P>
    <P>Part IV introduces another innovative feature under which it will be an offence for convicted child sex offenders to seek or apply for employment, voluntary or paid, involving unsupervised access to children without informing the prospective employer of the fact of the conviction. The new offence is designed to provide a deterrent to <Col N="1085" /> unsuitable people seeking access to children through the workplace, where relationships based on trust or fear can develop. At present, there is nothing to deter paedophiles from seeking or accepting such employment. The worst that can happen is that he or she would be refused employment or whatever voluntary position is being sought. Under the proposed provision, the fact of the conviction in itself will not render the person unsuitable to work. It will be a matter for the prospective employer or, in the case of the self-employed, the child's parent or guardian, on being informed of the conviction, to decide if the conviction is relevant to the work or position concerned. Where a person applies for work and does not know or could not reasonably have known that the work involved unsupervised access to children, he or she will be obliged to inform the other party to the employment contract of the fact of the conviction as soon as he or she becomes aware of having such access to children. A person guilty of an offence under this Part will, on summary conviction, be liable to imprisonment of up to 12 months or a fine of £1,500 or both and on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or five years in prison or both.</P>
    <P>Part V provides, for the first time, for the post release supervision of convicted sex offenders by the probation and welfare service for whom the sentencing court considers the appropriate sentence is one of deprivation of liberty. Persons sentenced to life imprisonment are excluded because on release from prison they are always placed under lifelong Probation and Welfare Service supervision in the community as a condition of temporary release.</P>
    <P>The supervision of sex offenders in the community after their release from prison has two aims. First, to help the offender maintain self-control over his or her offending behaviour and, second, to provide external monitoring of his or her post release behaviour and activities. The provision will be particularly helpful for those offenders who have undergone sex offender treatment programmes while in prison and who would benefit from a continuation of appropriate programmes following release from prison.</P>
    <P>The system of post release supervision being introduced will enable the courts, at the time of conviction, to sentence a sex offender to a determinate sentence with the latter part of it being served in the community under Probation and Welfare Service supervision. The combined custodial and non-custodial periods will not exceed the maximum custodial sentence available for the crime committed.</P>
    <P>In considering whether to impose a sentence involving post release supervision, the court will have regard to the need, first, for a period of supervision after the offender has been released; second, the need to protect the public from serious harm from the offender; third, the need to prevent the commission of further sexual <Col N="1086" /> offences by the offender; and fourth, the need for further rehabilitation of the offender. In order to assist it in deciding whether to impose a sentence involving post release supervision, the court may hear evidence or receive submissions from any concerned person, for example, a probation and welfare officer, the prosecution or the convicted person. The supervision period commences on the date the offender is released from prison, taking account of any remission earned.</P>
    <P>The court, in addition to the supervision requirement, may impose additional requirements, including the requirement to attend psychological counselling or other treatment programmes run by the Probation and Welfare Service or other bodies or a requirement prohibiting a sex offender from doing things which the court considers necessary for the purpose of protecting the public from serious harm from the offender. Thus, the supervision period will be tailored on a case by case basis according to the needs of the individual offender and the community.</P>
    <P>Another innovation in the Bill is the introduction in Part VI of separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases where application is made to adduce evidence or to cross-examine the complainant about his or her past sexual experience. The Law Reform Commission in its report on rape expressed doubts as to the constitutional propriety of separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases in so far as it might alter the balance of the criminal process and deprive the accused of a trial in due course of law. The sexual history of a victim of a sexual assault offence, including rape, is only permitted to be introduced into a trial with the leave of the judge. The application to introduce such evidence must prove that the evidence is relevant. Since such applications are made in the absence of the jury, I am advised that the proposed provision, which is limited to the particular application under the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, does not pose any constitutional difficulties as the jury will be unaware of the apparent inequality of representation. This would appear to be as far as the Constitution would allow such a provision to go.</P>
    <P>Overall, the provisions of the Bill are tough and I make no apology for that. I decided on them after considerable thought and extensive consultations inside and outside the jurisdiction. They will place certain sex offenders under an obligation to notify changes to their names and addresses for the rest of their lives but that will be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence of which they have been convicted by reference to the sentence imposed. The Bill is also innovative in that, for the first time, it introduces into our law statutory provisions for post release supervisions of convicted sex offenders. A further innovation is the provision aimed at preventing those convicted of sexual offences of seeking employment which would give them unsupervised <Col N="1087" /> access to children while keeping their past history in the dark.</P>
    <P>The Bill also delivers on the undertaking in the programme for Government to provide separate legal representation for complainants in rape cases in so far as it has been possible to do so. The Bill's provisions are comprehensive and consistent and have the overall aim, through measures of deterrence and rehabilitation, of preventing further offending by convicted sex offenders. It is a genuine and important contribution to our efforts to deal with the scourge of sex offending and I am confident it will have a real impact on the protection, in particular, of our most vulnerable citizens.</P>
    <P>The Bill is part of a series of measures I am taking against sex offenders and complements protections already in place. The next phase in the process will be to examine all outstanding issues relevant to the criminal law governing sexual offences. These are all addressed in the Discussion Paper on the Law on Sexual Offences. If that examination identifies any further changes that need to be made in the law, I will seek Government approval for such changes. However, we should not delude ourselves into thinking that there will ever be a complete defence against the determined sexual predator. At the same time, the Government must, and will, do all it can to make sure our children and other vulnerable persons will be protected as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Sex Offenders Bill, 2000. It is an important Bill which will play a significant role in the protection of children. It will make similar provisions in respect of the commission of certain sexual acts against children outside the Republic of Ireland and for other serious sexual offences. I introduced a similar Bill in the Dáil on 6 May 1998. It is unfortunate it has taken the Minister two years to respond, even though on that occasion he informed me that he would introduce a Bill as quickly as possible. I do not understand why the Government procrastinates on important legislation or promises early publication of legislation and then reneges on it.</P>
      <P>Many crimes are vicious and unpleasant but the crime of sexually abusing a young child and robbing that child of its innocence is so repugnant that we are entitled to consider special ways of dealing with the issue and making clear society's abhorrence of such activities. I agree with the Minister that we owe it to the people we serve to take steps to introduce measures and to amend the law to ensure that their safety, the safety of their families, particularly their children, remains a paramount priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to studies carried out in Britain of hardened paedophiles, repeat offences run at an estimated rate of 95%. Suffice to say this makes the curative approach quite unrealistic. Containment and control is the appropriate policy in <Col N="1088" /> these circumstances. This needs to be combined with a more effective and co-operative arrangement among the agencies concerned and a long-term preventative effort directed at child abuse. The rate of recidivism among other sex offenders is less pronounced but disturbingly common nevertheless.</P>
    <P>The Bill when enacted will establish a register of those convicted of sexual offences against children and other serious sexual assaults. Under the proposed legislation, judges will have discretion regarding who goes on the register. The register will extend also to people convicted of similar offences outside the jurisdiction. It is ironic that the eminent Mr. Justice Budd released from Arbour Hill Prison a former Irish soldier on condition that he agreed to be registered in Britain as a sex offender. He was serving a six year sentence imposed in 1995 for sexually abusing his stepsister and assaulting another victim aged ten years. He agreed to reside with relatives in the UK. This is a firm indication of the view of the Judiciary with regard to the availability to them of a register of sex offenders to ensure there is some control over their movements.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an important step in the fight against child sex abuse and other serious sexual offences against adults. Society must give the rights of children priority over those of their abusers. The Bill is not a panacea to prevent all serious sexual offences either against children or adults. No measure can control all paedophiles but the Bill is a significant step which will help the Garda to trace those who might offend. If the Garda were armed with information provided under the Bill, this would not just help them identify suspects following the commission of a crime, it would act as a deterrent to some would-be re-offenders. The notification requirements of the offender are stringent, and rightly so. The offender must, either by personal attendance at a Garda station or by written notice, notify his or her name and home address to the Garda Síochána within ten days of becoming subject to the requirements. Thereafter, he or she must again within ten days of the event notify the Garda Síochána of any subsequent changes of his or her name or address and any other addresses at which he or she resides for a period of ten days, or two or more periods, which taken together amount to ten days in any 12 months. Persons who leave the State for an intended continuous period of ten days or more at a time must inform the Garda in advance of their leaving. If the person when leaving did not intend to remain outside the State for a continuous period of ten days but does, he or she must inform the Garda within a further ten days. The notification requirements will not apply during any period the person concerned is either in custody, in prison or in the Central Mental Hospital or temporarily released. Access to information on the register will be restricted to the Garda.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Bill fails to deal with the disclosure of such information other than for <Col N="1089" /> employment purposes. While the Garda can see the sex offenders register, the Bill does not cater for people to whom the information may be of importance, such as those involved in voluntary organisations, sporting organisations and other such bodies. Perhaps the Minister will outline how the information will be disseminated to those to whom the information is relevant. The Bill does not say whether this will be at the discretion of the Garda and, if so, whether the release of information will vary between different Garda stations or units. It does not pin down what will be done with the information on the register, other than that the information will be with the Garda who can be vigilant. I accept the Garda should be in possession of the information. However, it appears all the onus will be on the Garda to ensure sex offenders do not enter places where they could come into contact with children. If this is so, is there too much onus on the Garda to be vigilant in all situations?</P>
    <P>As proposed in the Fine Gael Bill of 1998, there should be certain access to the register. That Bill proposed that access to the register, &ldquo;shall be confined to the Garda Síochána, information contained in the register shall not be disclosed to any other person, save with the permission of a designated High Court judge on the application of a member of the Garda not below the rank of inspector. Such an application which must be heard <i>in camera </i>shall not be granted unless, in the opinion of the judge, it is in the interests of public safety to do so. The judge who grants an application shall specify in his or her order the extent to which disclosure is to be permitted&rdquo;. In other words, we proposed the senior garda would go to a High Court judge and obtain permission to disclose information. For example, if a person unknown to a GAA club was coming to coach an under age team, how can the club check to ensure the coach is not on the register?</P>
    <P>Section 5 enables the senior Garda officer to apply to the Circuit Court for a sex offender order against any sex offender whose behaviour in the community gives the Garda Síochána cause for concern. What happens if a significant person in the community has a concern about the behaviour of someone in the community? I appreciate he can report it to the Garda Síochána but can he not obtain this information? It is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. Two criteria must be satisfied before the order can be applied for and made. First, the offender must have been convicted and found guilty but insane, with regard to a sexual offence defined in the Bill before or after the commencement of the sex offender order. Where the offender was convicted abroad the court shall also need to satisfy itself that the offence corresponds with a sexual offence as defined in the Bill. Second, the respondent must have acted in such a way as to give the court reasonable grounds for believing that the order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. The order must be limited to those which are necessary for the purpose of protecting <Col N="1090" /> the public from serious harm from the respondent. The court will not be able to compel a person to do anything, only not to do certain things. However, the Bill places an onus on convicted sex offenders to inform prospective employers of the nature of their conviction when applying for a position involving unsupervised access to children.</P>
    <P>The period in which a person remains on the register varies. There is a minimum five year period for those convicted and sentenced to a non-custodial sentence or a fully suspended sentence, a seven year period for those sentenced to a custodial sentence of six months or less, a ten year period for those sentenced to a custodial sentence of between six months and two years and a lifetime notification obligation for those sentenced to more than two years. The periods that would otherwise be applicable, five, seven or ten years, are halved for offenders under 18 years of age. The Bill is not a panacea for the problem of sex offending.</P>
    <P>In a report by the eminent journalist Phelim McAleer in 1997 he outlined that four Derry paedophiles had moved to Cork to avoid the sex offenders register, which tracks and monitors their movements within the UK. He stated that the revelation would increase concern that sex abusers are now using the Republic as a safe haven to continue their activities. It is important that the Bill be enacted as quickly as possible to ensure the Republic is no longer regarded by paedophiles as a safe haven.</P>
    <P>He reported that according to a legal source in Derry who deals with ex-prisoners, the four paedophiles who moved to Cork met when serving their sentences at Magilligan prison outside the city. One of the men is a persistent offender who has served two separate jail terms. The legal source said that from the questions the men asked before they left, it was clear they were going to Cork to avoid the register. They asked if they could be tracked there and what were their obligations. Cork is a logical choice, it has no register and it is the furthest possible place in Ireland from Derry.</P>
    <P>The source said, &ldquo;If you go to Dublin for the weekend and walk up Grafton Street, it is even money you will meeting somebody from Derry. Go to Limerick and it would be highly unlikely, go to Cork and it would be even less likely. Cork is also a city. In a city you can be more anonymous.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is some evidence that groups of paedophiles are arriving in the Republic from Britain. The situation is a very dangerous one. Being in each others company provides paedophiles with self justification, each validating the other's illegal behaviour as acceptable. In those circumstances, they pose a high degree of risk to children.</P>
    <P>Mr. McAleer reports that Breedge Gadd, Head of the Northern Ireland probation board, said that the failure to set up a register in the Republic means it will attract paedophiles, particularly persistent offenders, who intend to continue abusing. <Col N="1091" /> She saw it as an inevitability that people involved in paedophile rings would see the South as a safe haven. She said it was clear that abusers would take advantage of the loophole.</P>
    <P>She is quoted as saying, &ldquo;A paedophile with evil intent will almost naturally go to one or other parts of these islands which does not have a register and where his movements are not being monitored as closely.&rdquo;  Miss Gadd said that those in statutory agencies who work with sex offenders were increasingly finding that their clients had moved to the Republic. She said, &ldquo;I hear from other professionals that there are people who have gone to the South. There is word around Northern Ireland that it is happening.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Ireland it is estimated that about 5% of boys and 7% of girls are sexually abused before the age of 16. The estimate for physical abuse is put in a range of somewhere between 8% to 12% of children. The characteristics of a person who sexually abuses children vary depending on the relationship. If strangers are abusing a child they are generally loners, single men who usually have no history of being in a marital relationship. They attack children in a violent way in a once off situation. They sexually assault a child and move on to other victims. They accumulate a number of victims and have been known to claim as many as 200-300 victims.</P>
    <P>A different type of sexual offender is a parent or blood relative who abuses a child. Such offenders do not have many victims and are not usually violent. They persuade the child to accept the abuse over a long period. They convince the child that such abuse is an education or a game. They persuade them that it will do no harm. In most cases they are living with the child. Between the above two spectrums, the once off violent case and the close family relationship, there is a person who is known to the child but does not necessarily live in the house with the child. They can have a number of victims at any time or sequentially.</P>
    <P>All sex offenders tend to have low self esteem, low sense of self worth and little understanding of their victim's position. They do not understand how the victim feels. They are of the view that they do not do the child any harm or minimise the harm caused. In many situations they can blame the child for the abuse. They blame the child for what happens, saying the child was too friendly or too dependent. They do not accept any blame for the abuse. If they accept any blame they usually point to an external source such as drunkenness and make excuses for their actions.</P>
    <P>Such offenders are usually socially isolated. The main difference between physical and sexual abuse is that the latter can never be accidental. Sexual abuse is planned and if it takes place in the home that planning is over a long period, whereas physical abuse can occur on the spur of the moment.</P>
    <P>Deep regret usually follows physical abuse because the person lost his or her temper and did <Col N="1092" /> not intend to harm the child. Studies reveal that child sex offenders are approximately 85% male and 15% female. For physical abuse the figure is 50-50.</P>
    <P>Most sexually abused children suffer long-term traumatic stress disorders and usually a range of mental health problems. They often inflict self-harm, either directly through deliberate self injury and self mutilitation or indirectly through eating disorders and drug abuse. Once children have become victims of abuse they tend to suffer further abuse in their later life at the hands of the same person or another perpetrator.</P>
    <P>Children who are abused in a family situation are often more vulnerable to the advances of paedophiles when they reach school age and adolescence. This is due to their low self esteem and low self-confidence. The paedophile identifies these people and targets them by offering them some form of comfort and attention. One cannot argue about controlling the movement of paedophiles when one examines the effects of their vile activities. Children who suffer sexual abuse are likely to suffer deep and extremely traumatic effects as teenagers and as an adults. They suffer from multiple personalities; bouts of alcohol consumption to the point of feeling suicidal; depression and elation; nervous breakdown; an inability to see the difference between reality and fantasy and long periods spent alone in self-imposed isolation from other human beings due to their mistrust and disbelief in humanity and discarding friendships as a spoiled child discards a sweet paper. They live most of their lives in a state of fear. The argument that people who inflict this suffering should not be controlled is akin to condemning many children to a life of no self esteem or self worth, of helplessness, isolation and difficulty with relationships.</P>
    <P>The argument is often advanced that a register will leave those who are on it open to attack. The Bill is unclear as to how the Garda will use the information on the names on the register. It is known that paedophiles operate in this country. The gardaí have uncovered a major paedophile ring which has been operating in the west for several years. Middle aged and elderly men have been targeting boys in their early teens and using them for sex. The Garda believe at least a dozen men have been involved since the late 1980s and that members of the ring sought to win the boys' affections and eventually propositioned them. In many cases the approaches were made in or near public toilets in Galway City centre. Other boys were targeted near the promenade in Salthill. A boy who agreed to go with a man was usually invited into his car. The <i>Irish Independent </i>reported that the men then drove to a remote area outside the city and sexual activity took place in the back of the vehicle. The boys were sometimes rewarded with money while information on their names and whereabouts was later passed among the ring. A number of boys were subsequently followed by other men and propositioned after the adults indicated that they had a <Col N="1093" /> mutual acquaintance. In many cases the boys were from poor backgrounds and came from families where the home circumstances were far from ideal. They were easy targets.</P>
    <P>While such a paedophile ring is dreadful and disgusting in itself, it prompts a still more dreadful question. Is it the only one of its kind in the country? We cannot afford not to answer this question because there is a strong possibility that more paedophile rings exist than the one whose vile activities were disclosed.</P>
    <P>It has long been known that paedophiles are well organised. A number operate throughout Europe and most recently on the Internet. This is a particularly disturbing phenomenon as innocent people can access information by mistake. It is very easy for a paedophile ring to create a home page titled under an agreed name. The ring can decide to include child pornography under a pre-determined though innocent generic heading. Tracking this takes law enforcement agencies significant time and resources. When the processing has eventually been done the paedophile ring has moved to its next home page.</P>
    <P>Many paedophiles do not use hard core pornography to sexually excite themselves. What would be considered innocent photographs of children playing on a beach or having a bath can be intensely erotic to a paedophile.</P>
    <P>Having such a register of child sex offenders is a new approach for the Irish justice system and is absolutely necessary. Everybody accepts that among criminals, paedophiles are a special category. We can distinguish their activity from that of violent criminals. Research shows that paedophiles are highly manipulative and clever. Their offending behaviour often intensifies as they get older. They are in a particularly dangerous category and there is a need for a register to tackle the particular problem.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in dealing with hardened paedophiles is that they do not consider their activities to be wrong. Hardened paedophiles believe that the rest of us set unfair parameters to their sexual activity. They do not believe that having sex with children is wrong. Many of them believe it is the right thing to do and that we are wrong for trying to restrain their activity. That is what makes them especially dangerous and why some are so clever and manipulative.</P>
    <P>The great awareness of child sexual offending, the huge emphasis placed on the problem and the social revulsion at such abuse do not confer a licence on people to take the law into their own hands. Repugnance at child sexual abuse cannot justify mob rule. There can be few more reviled figures in Ireland today than the person who sexually abuses and offends children. In the past paedophiles were often tolerated and classified as dirty old men whom it was better to avoid. They were rarely prosecuted. The new awareness of the damage done to children by such people has totally changed society's attitude to them.</P>
    <P>Offenders are released from prison without any real co-ordination between the various statutory <Col N="1094" /> agencies. The Bill recognises that nothing could be more hateful than sexual offences against the most innocent and vulnerable members of our society. It contains important provisions to tackle the problem which is the cause of widespread concern. Its enactment will mean that the Garda Síochána will have up to date information on the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders and others and will be able to use this information for the investigation and prevention of crime. The registration requirements will be a powerful deterrent to offenders who will be aware that from the moment they register a change of address the Garda will be aware of their presence and will have them in their sights. Those who attempt not to register will be aware that they are committing a further offence. It is argued that those named on the register will be open to attack and I presume the Minister will take steps to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not a panacea for all sex offences. The Children at Risk in Ireland Foundation gave the Bill a qualified welcome. The foundation cautioned against any perception of the introduction of a sex offenders register as a panacea for the problem of child sexual abuse. Mary Flaherty, the foundation's national director said:</P>
    <P>National and international statistics clearly indicate that the majority of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone known to both the child and his or her family and the notion of &ldquo;stranger danger&rdquo;, the dirty old men in raincoats, is largely a myth.   </P>
    <P>Some estimates suggest that up to 70% of abusers are family members and we clearly cannot rely on the register to help us detect or pre-empt the bulk of these cases. Though the introduction of the measure is welcome and long overdue, it is important not to overstate its effectiveness in combating the problem of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which introduces separate legal representation for complainants in rape and other serious sexual assault cases during applications to adduce evidence or cross-examination on the complainant's past sexual experience. This issue has long been debated and I congratulate the Minister on introducing this measure for which there is an obvious need. Many witnesses in such cases feel extremely intimidated during cross-examination and exposure without protection in very strange circumstances in a court of justice. They will now have available to them advice and assistance from a legal expert while giving evidence. This is a welcome development and will assist in securing more convictions. Many of those who are raped or suffer other serious sexual offences allow the crime to go unpunished because they fear being intimidated in court. While it will not eliminate all their concerns, the presence of legal representation should be of assistance.</P>
    <P>At any one time ten sex offenders receive treatment in custody. It is a disgrace that more ser<Col N="1095" /> vices are not available to ensure sex offenders obtain assistance. I have research information from the United States which shows the effect of such treatment. Will the Minister outline the up-to-date position on the treatment of sex offenders?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is both necessary and timely. Unfortunately we live in a world where such legislation is needed and of necessity it needs to be accompanied by effective treatment for sex offenders before being rereleased into the community, an issue raised on a number of occasions at Question Time. I was informed in reply to a parliamentary question on 7 March that of the 80 sex offenders released during 1999 only five had completed the dedicated Arbour Hill programme. This represents a decrease on the figures for 1998 during which 103 sex offenders were released, of which 11 had completed the programme. In percentage terms this represents a reduction from 10.7% to 6.25%. These figures are alarming and represent a step backwards rather than forwards, which is to be regretted. The Minister has promised to introduce a new programme in the Curragh. When is this likely to be introduced?</P>
      <P>Why do so few participate in the programme? The Minister said that offenders cannot be compelled to participate, that some are not suitable and that there are other options, but this is a tailor-made dedicated programme specifically designed for sex offenders and there is no logical explanation as to why only five of the 80 offenders released last year had completed the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the apparent ongoing incidents of unprovoked and random attacks, on young men in particular, on the streets and in the suburbs of Dublin. Will the Minister outline the most up-to-date information available on this phenomenon as it is important that we are clear on the scale of the problem? It may be the case that some attacks go unreported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears common to hear stories of young people being attacked on their way home after a night out and the level of violence in some of these incidents is alarming. This week I was contacted by a parent whose son had been attacked on Rathmines Road. He was returning home from a night out with some friends but was unable to get a taxi and suffered a completely unprovoked attack in which his front teeth were knocked out. He had never seen his attackers before and had no conversation with them before <Col N="1096" /> the attack. I have heard of similar incidents in Temple Bar and other areas of Dublin. Another 16 year old boy was threatened with a needle in a DART station on his way home after the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. The stories go on. It appears that everyone has a story to tell about such incidents.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in my constituency there was a decrease in muggings and handbag snatching some time ago. I believed at the time that the provision of drug treatment clinics was easing the problem, and this was to be welcomed. This phenomenon of attacks, predominantly on young men, appears to be increasing. These attacks are a source of concern and deserve attention. On the one hand I do not want to alarm young people and parents but on the other we must have safe streets in our city centre and suburbs. They should not become no-go areas, as has happened in other countries. Our young people should be safe in our major urban centres and suburbs and if this problem is emerging on a serious scale measures must be put in place to interrupt it before it gets out of control. There is a need for an integrated approach which includes co-ordination of video surveillance, increased night-time Garda patrols and the provision of more taxis and late night transport facilities.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked whether these attacks are linked to more vulnerable, out-of-control, anti-social young people and adults not getting the service they need because of low numbers of probation and welfare officers and the lack of specialist units. The high availability and accessibility to drugs by young people in Dublin needs to be addressed in a proactive and co-ordinated way. There is evidence that adolescents in Dublin are engaging in higher levels of substance abuse than young people in other cities. These attacks may well be one of the consequences of this as well as alcohol abuse. Will the Minister report to the House on the matter? I thank him for being present to reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern with any act of violence and agree that incidents of unprovoked attacks are particularly disturbing. While I am concerned with reports of such incidents, as the Deputy acknowledged, it would be wrong at this early stage to draw firm conclusions or make assumptions about trends. In this respect the Garda authorities have informed me that they are of the view that there is no evidence that any specific pattern of such attacks is emerging. It would be wrong, therefore, to give the impression that there is an epidemic of unprovoked attacks in Dublin. By their nature, such offences are sporadic and the circumstances surrounding each case can be unclear. It is, therefore, difficult to give a precise statistical picture of the problem. I will, however, outline what I know to be the facts of some recent cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that 27 unprovoked attacks on males, 25 years of <Col N="1097" /> age or younger, were recorded in the Dublin metropolitan region in the first three months of the year. I understand that nine of these attacks were recorded in the north central division, five of which have been detected. Files have been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of four of these cases and three persons have been charged with the fifth assault. The remaining four cases are under investigation.</P>
    <P>In the southern division there were no reports of unprovoked attacks on young males.</P>
    <P>In the DMR northern division, two cases were recorded. In both of these incidents, a single youth was attacked by a group of three males. Both matters are being investigated by the Garda.</P>
    <P>Four cases were recorded in the DMR eastern division and files have been forwarded to the DPP for directions. In DMR west, investigations are continuing into the eight recorded attacks. Four cases were also recorded in Dublin south, all of which are currently under investigation.</P>
    <P>Some of these crimes were very recent and the House will appreciate that it would neither be appropriate or helpful for me to go into very specific detail nor to speculate as to the motive behind them. Obviously, it is of paramount importance that nothing is said or done which could interfere with or prejudice the outcome of a Garda investigation into any of these crimes or any likely future prosecutions which may result from them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald spoke yesterday on the Children Bill which is currently before the House. The debate on that Bill has given many Deputies the opportunity to ventilate their views on the area of juvenile justice, social exclusion and how the criminal justice system should deal with juvenile offenders. Moreover, many speakers also referred to the many new projects and imaginative measures which the Government has developed and is funding as part of the its agenda to tackle the root causes of crime. Allied to these measures, I remain wedded to my anti-crime programme which has yielded spectacular results since the Government came into office. Overall crime in the State is down by 21% over that period and I assure the House, at a time of record funding of the criminal justice system, there is no let up in our determination to keep our streets safe for the public.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Criminal Assets.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment. I am bringing this proposal, which I have raised with successive Ministers for Justice, to the attention of the Minister and the Government. I raise it today at the request of many local community organisations and anti-drugs groups in areas of Dublin city which have suffered greatly during the past 20 years as a result of the drugs crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is that, where moneys or assets are confiscated by the courts from drug dealers and where these moneys are then returned to the Exchequer, the Government of the day, in the person of the Minister with responsibility for the drugs issue, should, in each case, make special grants of the same amount as that confiscated <Col N="1098" /> available to community and sports projects in the designated drugs task force areas. These facilities would be of benefit to both young people and the elderly, all of whom have been victims of the drugs crisis, though in different ways.</P>
    <P>This proposal would not cost the State or the taxpayer a single penny, it would simply involve the redirection of moneys seized from drug dealers back to those whom those drug dealers had exploited. It would also take the form of an additional grant to under-resourced community facilities. There would be no question of these moneys replacing other grants currently available or of community projects having to wait until confiscated moneys became available. This proposal would simply provide an additional resource for under-resourced projects.</P>
    <P>I will provide a specific example to the Minister. I campaigned in recent years in support of anti-drugs groups for the establishment of the youth facilities fund which is now in place and which is disbursing grants in drugs task force areas. This fund is very worthwhile and represents a tremendous initiative in the provision and financial underpinning of community, youth and sports projects.</P>
    <P>One of the largest single grants from this fund was allocated to the Cabra area in my constituency. A sum of £810,000 for the construction of a community sports and recreation complex has been made available on the initiative of the Cabra Community Against Drugs Organisation through its involvement on the Finglas/Cabra local drugs task force, of which I am a member. However, the total estimated cost of building the complex at John Paul Park, Nephin Road, is in the region of £3 million which leaves a shortfall of £2.2 million. Cabra Community Development Ltd. recently launched a major fundraising campaign as its contribution to the overall cost and no doubt further Government grants will also be made available to this project.</P>
    <P>In this case, as in many others, an additional badly needed boost could be provided by an allocation from the confiscated assets of drug dealers. It seems reasonable and logical that a community group which has successfully and voluntarily struggled against drug dealers, marched against them, worked to provide treatment facilities for the victims of drug abuse and which is now working to provide youth facilities in an attempt to divert young people away from the nightmare path of drug addiction should be given direct grants from the moneys confiscated from those who made vast profits by exploiting young people in the areas to which I refer. I emphasise that this is just one example of how this proposal could work.</P>
    <P>There is one further argument I will make in support of my case. Most people now agree that it was neglect on the part of successive Governments which gave rise to the heroin/drugs crisis in disadvantaged communities, particularly those in Dublin. State neglect led to direct community action and this, in turn, led to belated Government action, the results of which are now, I hope, beginning to turn the tide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> I strongly believe that, in retribution for the appalling years of neglect, it would be a worthwhile gesture to accept this demand, which emanates from the communities to which I refer, and redirect the confiscated assets back to the drug plagued designated areas. Regardless of the contents of his script, I ask the Minister to agree to at least consider this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking or the disposal of the proceeds of crime generally arise under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. The terms of those Acts require that moneys realised as a result are to be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer by the Minister for Finance. Therefore, any change as suggested by Deputy Gregory would require a change in the legislation governing confiscation. In that context, I am not sure that having the matter raised on the Adjournment is the appropriate way to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, I acknowledge the concerns raised by Deputy Gregory. There is no doubt that those communities which have suffered as a result of the activities of drug dealers have to be assisted to rid themselves of this menace. It seems the real point which concerns the Deputy is that the profits of drug dealing which the State succeeds in having confiscated should be put back into helping those communities to recover and that this funding can only be guaranteed, at least to some extent, by ensuring that the sums which are confiscated are returned to these communities to finance drugs awareness or other projects.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the initiatives which are under way as part of the Government's multi-agency approach to dealing with the drugs problem. These involve my Department and other agencies to divert young people, in particular, away from a life of crime and from involvement in drugs.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provides funding of more than £1.7 million annually for Garda juvenile diversion projects targeted at young people in the ten to 18 age group, particularly those who are seriously at risk of becoming involved in drug misuse and crime, who are already involved in crime or who are likely to drop out of the education system prematurely. There are 29 such projects at present in Dublin and other major urban centres. The Garda are also involved in other initiatives to reduce the demand for drugs among young people, including drug awareness programmes, visits to schools and juvenile diversion programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national drugs strategy, a sum of £10 million has been allocated on an annual basis to support the implementation of more than 200 projects proposed by local drugs task forces in their areas. A further £15 million over a two year period was allocated in August 1999 to support <Col N="1100" /> the development of new service development plans by the local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government has allocated £35 million over three years, up to 2001, under the Young People's Facilities and Services Programme. The money will assist in the development of preventative strategies in disadvantaged areas, where a significant drugs problem exists or has the potential to develop, through the development of youth, sport and recreational facilities and services.</P>
    <P>These initiatives will contribute substantially towards dealing with the drugs problem in those communities worst affected as well as the associated problem of social exclusion. In this latter context I should mention the significant funding being made available to tackle social exclusion under the national development plan, including £16 million to facilitate the expansion of the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and approximately £70 million for additional crime prevention measures.</P>
    <P>Funding for all of these initiatives is provided by the Exchequer. I am sure Deputy Gregory would agree that even if it was not contrary to standard public accounting procedures to transfer particular revenues to particular purposes, there is significantly greater certainty of funding arising from these initiatives than would be the case if it was dependent on diverting sums realised from the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate Deputy Gregory's concerns in raising this issue, I hope he will agree that the current arrangements for the provision of funding on an unparalleled and historic scale for these and other initiatives is the best way to counter the effects of crime, especially drug trafficking and related criminal activity. In addition to these funds, it appears the Deputy is seeking an expression by the powers that be of their abhorrence of drug dealing by committing some or all of the funds arising from the 1994 Act and the 1996 Act to areas worst affected by the problem concerned.</P>
    <P>As the person who pushed the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, through the House from the Opposition benches, I can confirm that the Bill received the full support of Deputy Gregory and others. Under the legislation it was intended that the proceeds would be frozen for a period of seven years and that only then would the funds revert to the Exchequer or, in the alternative, if the owner could be found, to the true owner of the illicit assets.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is saying, even while it would affect the standard public accounting procedure. Over time the House will have the opportunity to consider what should be done with the funds, which are currently frozen, when they are realised for the Exchequer. The Deputy's suggestion can be given serious consideration by the Government of the day on that occasion and by this House in the meanwhile.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 April 2000.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey): A communication from the European Commission on priorities in EU road safety was presented to the transport council on 20 March 2000. The communication reviews progress on the EU Road Safety Action Programme 1997-2001 and proposes a number of short and medium term priorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the alcohol factor in road accidents, the communication indicates the Commission's intention, instead of promoting an existing or new legislative proposal, to submit a recommendation to member states emphasising the need for more effective enforcement and international co-operation in prosecuting drink driver offenders as well as the adoption of a 50 milligram blood alcohol limit or even lower limits for certain categories.</P>
    <P>Prior to the presentation of its communication to the Council the Commission had informal consultations with representatives of member states in relation to the issue of blood alcohol levels through the EU high level group on road safety. My Department's contribution to these discussions was based on the principles set out in the Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002. These recognise the relatively recent introduction of the 80 milligram blood alcohol limit in Ireland and the consequent priority to improve compliance with this requirement rather than to move to new limits. The strategy concluded that the Government would follow the progress of fdevelopments internationally, as well as progress towards relevant national road safety targets, in considering the adequacy of the present 80 milligram limit in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of unfinished housing estates is essentially one for each local authority and my Department does not systematically collect information on this matter. However, the Department did carry out an informal survey in 1998 among local authorities on the <Col N="1102" /> extent of the problems with unfinished housing estates and the factors contributing to such problems. Replies were received from 77 of the 88 planning authorities and revealed that 706 housing estates were then regarded as unfinished, which, along with a further 542 finished estates, had not yet been taken in charge. The size of the estates involved ranged from two to 200 houses. From the information received it is not possible to estimate the number of houses affected.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have available any estimate of the potential cost to local authorities of completing the estates. Local authorities have been asked by my Department to ensure that permissions for development of housing estates are subject to a condition under which an acceptable security is provided by way of bond or otherwise so as to ensure the satisfactory completion of the estate.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of planning control is a matter for planning authorities. In addition, it is open to any person to seek a court order under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, as amended, requiring compliance with conditions laid down by the planning authority. The planning Acts specifically allow for conditions about the giving of security, the phasing and completion of works and the occupation of structures. Effective use of such conditions by local authorities and follow-up enforcement action can do much to obviate the kind of problems that arise in unfinished estates. The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, includes much strengthened provisions regarding the enforcement of planning law and will enable a planning authority to refuse to grant permission to a developer based on past non-performance, subject to the consent of the High Court.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for new requirements on planning authorities concerning the taking in charge of housing estates. Where an estate has been completed to the satisfaction of the local authority, the authority will be required to take it in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request that the authority do so. Where an estate is unfinished, and the seven year period for taking enforcement action has expired, and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will be obliged to take the estate in charge.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the improved quality control and-or regulation of <Col N="1103" /> driving instruction have already been announced. These proposals provide that in general from 1 January 2002 driving instructors, if they wish to continue instructing, will have to undergo a compulsory test of their competence to instruct. The proposals also, however, provide that where driving instructors are registered with a recognised body which meets certain agreed criteria, they will be exempt from this test.</P>
      <P>An information meeting, open to individuals and representative bodies involved in driving instruction, was organised by my Department on 22 March 2000 and provided briefing in relation to the above. Arrangements were also made at this meeting for a working group to develop recommendations for the standards to be met by recognised bodies. This work will now be taken forward.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The 1999 assessment of homelessness in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, which was prepared for the homeless initiative by the Economic and Social Research Institute, indicated that there was a total of 3,890 homeless people in the area during the week of the survey. This compares with a total of 1,632 homeless people in the same area in the 1996 assessment. Part of this increase was due to the broadening of the definition of homelessness and a change in the methodology used for compiling the figures. In 1996, the assessment of homeless persons was made on one single night and in 1999, the count was complied over one week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the call reported in the media which was made by Focus Ireland for annual <Col N="1106" /> expenditure of £39 million over the next five years to deal with the problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>It is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned in co-operation with the other statutory and voluntary agencies to formulate responses to meet the accommodation and welfare needs of homeless people in their areas. My Department will continue to afford priority to providing resources and support for a range of measures to meet the accommodation needs of homeless people. The need for a comprehensive response to homelessness was acknowledged in the establishment of the cross-Department team on homelessness whose remit includes health, education, employment as well as accommodation needs. The team's report and recommendations on how the problem of homelessness should be addressed comprehensively will be considered by the Government in the near future. Much is already being done for homeless persons but more is required and it is essential that there is a coherent strategy for the delivery of services to homeless persons. The cross-Department team report will address these matters.</P>
    <P>A special £5 million allocation over the two years 2000 and 2001 was made in the recent budget for the provision of two high support hostels for homeless people suffering from drug and alcohol addictions and is being made available to Dublin Corporation to build or acquire and redevelop suitable premises for these purposes. This allocation will supplement the £4 million allocation in the public capital programme for the provision by local authorities of hostel accommodation this year.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme, which also provides housing accommodation for homeless persons, is being expanded to provide 22,000 housing starts over the next four years and will assist in housing homeless persons.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives to respond to Dublin's transportation needs. These include major infrastructure projects such as Luas, the Dublin Port Tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-Ring, other improvements in public transport, such as quality bus corridors and traffic and parking management measures.</P>
      <P>Progress with the construction and planning of these infrastructure projects is indicated in current work being undertaken on the extension of the DART, the Southern Cross Motorway and ministerial approvals to the Tallaght-Abbey Street and Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green links of the Luas, the Dublin Port Tunnel and the south eastern and northern motorways. By end 1999, an estimated £500 million had been invested in Dublin transport management and infrastructure within the DTI framework. Under the national development plan, over £3 billion is provided to continue DTI related funding through the period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>Good progress is being made with implementation of the Dublin Transportation Office short-term action plan which is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2000. For example, all 150 of the planned new buses have been delivered; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the quality bus corridor network with three QBCs now in operation; the programme of platform lengthening is well under way; delivery of the additional DART rolling stock and railcars has commenced and the upgrading of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line is due for completion by end 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Office of Director of Traffic, Dublin Corporation, has been established to bring greater concentration and efficiency to traffic administration within the city and has already achieved significant improvements in parking enforcement and traffic engineering.</P>
      <P>For the longer term, the DTO is now finalising an update to the original DTI strategy, taking account of the strategic planning guidelines published in 1999 and of a planning horizon to 2016. An outline of this work will shortly be presented to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development.</P>

These improvements included the granting of some 750 wheelchair accessible taxi licences since 1997 and pilot testing of taxi sharing.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to provide for a more rapid expansion of the Dublin taxi fleet required that the determination of new taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences numbers in the Dublin taximeter area should be temporarily reserved to ministerial regulations. The delegation of full taxi regulation powers will be restored to the Dublin local authorities at the earliest possible date to allow them to maintain the equilibrium of taxi supply and demand into the future.</P>

The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>

    <P>I expect the requirement from 1 April, to present a test certificate to renew the licence on a liable car will effect a considerable increase in the take-up of NCT test appointments.</P>

      <P>Peter Bacon and Associates, economic consultants, have been commissioned to undertake a general review of housing market developments since the introduction by the Government of the measures under Action on House Prices, April 1998, and Action on the Housing Market, March 1999, and to carry out an evaluation of recent developments in housing demand, housing supply and house prices.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the study are to assess the impact of Government measures in relation to supply, demand, cost of housing and housing land, to assess changes in affordability of housing, to assess the impact of lending policies of the mortgage lenders on the housing market, to estimate the short and medium-term prospects for serviced land availability and housing supply having regard to housing demand, to conduct an up-to-date short and medium-term model-based assessment of likely demand for housing, including for rented accommodation, distinguishing in particular expected developments in major population centres and having regard to recent and prospective developments in areas such as interest rates, incomes and taxation and to develop a framework-methodology to enable the Department, on an ongoing basis to carry out reviews and assessments of housing market developments.</P>
      <P>On the basis of these terms of reference, it is envisaged that the consultants will make recommendations for further actions to bring supply into line with demand, including the management of demand, and further increases as necessary in housing output, having regard to the safeguards required in relation to the quality of the residential environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> The review has been commenced and it is envisaged that it will be concluded by the end of May. I anticipate that the results of the review will be considered urgently by Government and then published together with an appropriate response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI is one of a range of economic commentators which forecast house prices and its forecasts appear to be towards the upper end of the scale. Most other economic commentators, including Davy Stockbrokers, Irish Permanent, and most recently, AIB Group Treasury, agree that a welcome element of moderation has come into the market, and that, as the number of new houses coming on stream continues to increase this year, they expect to see the level of price growth continuing to moderate. For example, the latest AIB quarterly economic commentary has forecast that national house price increases will continue to moderate with expected growth of 15% this year and 10% in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department does not publish projections of future house price levels, there is strong evidence that the range of measures being taken by the Government to remove overheating in the <Col N="1113" /> housing market and accelerate housing supply are bringing about significant moderation in house price increases. Figures for the final quarter of 1999 indicate average annual house price increases of approximately 16% for new houses and 18% for second-hand houses on a national basis &ndash; well below the peak rates of increase, 26% and 37%, recorded in mid-1998. Annual rates of increase in Dublin for new and second-hand house prices, around 22%, are also well below the peaks of 37% and 42% reached in 1998. Moreover, indications of price trends in the early part of the year are also positive, with the Irish Permanent house price index and my Department's provisional monthly prices both showing further slowdowns.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy to moderate house price increases is based on increasing the supply of housing. The Government has implemented a comprehensive range of initiatives to this end, and these measures are having effect. Through the serviced land initiative and revised development plans and density guidelines, we have increased both the supply of housing land and the output which we can get from it.</P>
    <P>Output in Dublin city and county is particularly encouraging, surpassing 10,000 completions for the first time ever in 1999, and leading indicators for future development are positive, with Dublin HomeBond new house registrations up 36% in the first quarter of 2000.</P>
    <P>A strategic housing response team was established last year by the four Dublin local authorities to co-ordinate efforts to remove bottlenecks and expedite housing developments in the Dublin area. My Department's housing supply unit is liaising closely with the team to drive and effectively deliver on the range of measures to maximise housing output, where demand is greatest, and to remove supply and planning bottlenecks.</P>
    <P>Initiatives to provide affordable housing include the local authority affordable housing scheme launched in March 1999, and the shared ownership scheme. I have issued draft guidelines for implementing the housing supply provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Bill for full consultation and local authorities have been asked to commence work on preparation of housing strategies to ensure that the housing needs of all sectors of community are fully taken account of in development plans.</P>

      <P>The Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 1998, recently published by the Environmental Protection Agency, confirms generally low concentrations of smoke, sulphur dioxide, ozone and lead in monitored urban areas including Dublin and Cork. Carbon monoxide levels in Dublin and Cork were also well within WHO guidelines in the absence of any specific EU or national standards. However, the report confirmed that high concentrations of particulate matter in Dublin and nitrogen oxides in Dublin and Cork are closely associated with heavy traffic.</P>
      <P>While the relevant national and EU air quality standards are being met in both cities, it is recognised that the new EU limit values for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides will be challenging in urban areas with heavy traffic.</P>
      <P>A number of policies and measures which will facilitate meeting the new air quality standards to apply from 2005 and 2010 are already being implemented, and were outlined in the replies to Questions Nos. 592 of 26 January and 229 of 22 February 2000. Ongoing implementation at national level of the EU auto oil programme will continue to be supplemented as necessary by targeted local measures identified by Government and relevant authorities in the areas of traffic management, sustainable public transport and air quality management planning.</P>
      <P>Any further measures that may be required to comply with the new EU air quality standards will be guided by the results of the EPA's preliminary assessment of national air quality currently being undertaken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The 1997 report of the strategic review committee on the construction industry included a recommendation for a registration system for building contractors and sub-contractors. The report recommended that an independent body be established by the construction industry to administer the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1999, the forum for the construction industry submitted an interim report setting out preliminary proposals for the registration of contractors, the implementation of which would <Col N="1116" /> require legislation to protect the title of registered contractor.</P>
    <P>I accept the forum's proposals in principle subject to a number of modifications which are principally designed to enhance the coverage and independence of the registration system, in the interest of consumer protection. My Department has now conveyed my views to the forum and I await the forum's response.</P>
    <P>The registration of building workers is primarily a matter for FÁS, which operates under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. I understand that FÁS already maintains registers of skilled building workers who have completed their apprenticeships and of semi-skilled workers who have completed training under the construction skills certification scheme. I understand that FÁS plans to introduce by the end of this year the pilot phase of the safe pass scheme under which all building workers will participate in a basic training course on health and safety on construction sites. FÁS will also maintain a register of all those who participate in the safe pass scheme.</P>

      <P>Some 91,100 applicants are awaiting driving tests. Of these, approximately 25,400 have been given test appointments and a further 15,900 have indicated that they are not available to be tested. The average longest waiting time nationally is some 30 weeks, a reduction of ten weeks relative to the same period in 1999. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons are being given earlier appointments. About 24% of applicants are tested within 15 weeks.</P>
      <P>Average waiting times have not been compiled for each centre due to limitations in the IT systems involved. However, the tabular statement below sets out the longest waiting time for each centre.</P>
      <P>In 1999 an all time record of 154,000 test applications were made to my Department, compared with 118,000 applications in 1997. Applications for the early part of this year are running at 15% above the numbers received in the equivalent period in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 101 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing <Col N="1117" /> capacity of the service to some 200,000 tests annually. Two new test centres have been provided in Tallaght and Raheny.</P>
    <P>I am determined to promote improvement of the driving test service and to end current excessive and unacceptable waiting times. A maximum waiting period of ten weeks is being targeted by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 envisages significant private sector investment in national road development. Some £1 billion of the £4.4 billion provided for national roads improvements in the NDP is to come from PPP financing. Apart from the pilot projects already identified in the plan, designation of projects or parts of projects for PPP purposes will be decided as the plan is implemented. The appropriate funding structures, including road user tolls, for projects will also be examined and identified, bearing in mind the level of funding available and the appropriateness of particular projects for the PPP approach.</P>
      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is currently vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. The exercise of these powers has been subject to the approval of the Minister of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>In recently published amendments to the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, it is proposed to remove this requirement of ministerial approval of toll schemes, by-laws and agreements. Under the revised part V of the Roads Act, 1993, these matters will be brought fully within the discretion of the National Roads Authority or the relevant local road authority, in the case of national and non-national roads respectively.</P>
      <P>In parallel, the Roads Act, 1993, is also being amended to provide for the issue of policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the exercise of their road tolling functions, with which they will be obliged to comply. Any such policy directives would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 40 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 prioritises action on speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing as holding the greatest and most immediate potential for realising road safety gains. Promotional and enforcement activity in support of these priorities is particularly directed at known high risk categories of road users, including younger drivers. As indicated in the strategy, my Department has provided financial assistance to the DIR, which has enabled it to attain ISO 9002 certification. Further measures to ensure quality control of driving instruction, have recently been announced as indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 15 on today's Order Paper. All of these measures should enhance confidence in, and use of quality driving instruction.</P>
      <P>The strategy does not at this stage prioritise compulsory driving instruction nor the design of specific measures to prolong the training of inexperienced drivers. Such measures are not in wide operation internationally, nor are their benefits well agreed. However regard will be had to emerging international developments in this area, including proposals from the European Commission if such are brought forward, in the context of reviewing the strategy.</P>
      <P>Common standards for driving tests are already required under the provisions of Directive 91/439/EEC. The standard of driving test provided for in Ireland is as laid down in that directive.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to addressing the problem of homelessness. The need for a comprehensive response to homelessness was acknowledged in the establishment of the cross-Department team on homelessness whose remit includes health, education, employment as well as accommodation needs. The team's report and recommendations will be considered by the Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>A special £5 million allocation over the two years 2000 and 2001 was made in the recent budget for the provision of two high support hostels for homeless people suffering from drug and alcohol addictions and is being made available to Dublin Corporation to build or acquire and redevelop suitable premises for these purposes. This allocation will supplement the £4 million allocation in the public capital programme for the provision by local authorities of hostel accommodation this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is open to voluntary bodies to avail of funding under my Department's voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes to provide hostel and sheltered housing accommodation for homeless persons. The local authority housing programme which also provides housing accommodation for homeless persons is being expanded to provide 22,000 housing starts over the next four years.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out by the Dublin Simon Community in conjunction with Dublin Corporation in June 1998 indicated that there were 208 people sleeping rough in the Dublin area. A further survey on behalf of the homeless initiative in March 1999 indicated that there were 275 people sleeping rough in the Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow area. Most of these were in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I refer to the replies to Questions Nos. 58 of 16 November 1999 and 76 of 16 December 1999 as to measures being taken in relation to water quality generally.</P>
      <P>Primary statutory responsibility for the protection and management of water quality is assigned to local authorities by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990. The Three Rivers Project relates to the rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir and is jointly administered by Kildare County Council, Meath County Council and Tipperary SR County Council. This three-year project commenced in September 1998 with the overall aim of establishing monitoring systems and developing management strategies, which will conserve the waters of these river systems and restore them to good ecological status. A preliminary report was issued in March 2000 indicating the overall features of the catchments involved, the vulnerability of the three rivers to pollution from point and diffuse sources and the actions taken in the start-up phase of the project. I am satisfied that the establishment of these monitoring and management systems will provide a practical and effective framework for implementation within the catchments of national policies and measures including, for example, the implementation of the phosphorus regulations made by me in 1998 and the voluntary agreement concluded with the detergents industry in December 1999 for the phasing out of phosphate-based household detergents. I will give consideration to what further measures may be appropriate on my part when the final report and recommendations of the project become available.</P>

    <P>Very significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 101 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity to some 200,000 tests annually. I am determined to promote improvement of the driving test service and to end present excessive and unacceptable waiting times. A maximum waiting period of ten weeks is being targeted by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The local authority affordable housing scheme involves the provision of additional houses at below market prices specifically for low-income purchasers. Eligibility under the scheme is determined, <i>inter alia,</i> by <Col N="1125" /> satisfying an income test such that in the case of a single income household gross income does not exceed £20,000 and in the case of a two income household, such that two and a half times the gross income of the principal earner plus once the gross income of the subsidiary earner does not exceed £50,000. The scheme is a targeted initiative designed to provide additional new houses at affordable prices and less than the market prices in the area. It complements the existing shared ownership scheme under which local authorities also make available houses for sale to low-income house purchasers.</P>
      <P>The provision by local authorities of new houses for sale to low-income house purchasers under either the affordable or shared ownership scheme should, apart from benefiting the purchaser, also assist in moderating house price increases in the area. The Deputy will appreciate that average house prices reflect transactions in all sectors of the market and that typically prices paid by first time buyers are some 25%-30% less than average house prices.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to promote greater recycling of waste; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is now no kerbside collection of recyclable waste in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As outlined in my policy statement Changing our Ways, overall Government policy on waste management is committed to a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which will deliver ambitious waste recycling and recovery targets. These include recycling of 35% of municipal waste, recycling at least 50% of C&amp;D waste within a five year period, with a progressive increase to at least 85% over 15 years, and the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of organic waste annually.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have adopted or are currently engaged in finalising a range of regional and local waste management plans aimed at meeting these recovery targets. Typically, these plans incorporate proposals for household segregation and kerbside collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas; an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations and a range of waste treatment and disposal facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To support the delivery of improved waste management services and infrastructure under these plans, some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the National <Col N="1126" /> Development Plan 2000-2006. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>The four local authorities in Dublin have adopted a comprehensive regional waste management plan which aims at ensuring the recycling and biological treatment of some 60% of municipal waste arisings, and are actively engaged in its implementation. In this regard, Dublin local authorities are currently finalising arrangements for the establishment, and progressive extension throughout the region, of household segregation and kerbside collection services for organic and dry recyclable materials. I understand that these arrangements, which will effectively subsume the service hitherto provided by Kerbside Dublin Limited, will be announced very shortly. Ultimately, it is intended that this new service will encompass some 80% of households in the region, and it will be supplemented by an extension of the current network of bring banks and the development of new civic amenity sites for the reception of green waste and bulky items, including white and brown goods.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to further expand upon the policy issues and guidance outlined in Changing our Ways with the publication this year of a further policy statement focusing on waste minimisation, recycling and waste recovery generally. This policy document will address the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives and targets in this area, and will outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in the interests of a sustained expansion in recycling performance.</P>

      <P>Under the rural towns and villages initiative announced in the 1999 budget, £80 million is being allocated over the four years up to 2002 for the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure to promote the development of smaller agglomerations and to combat rural depopulation. Over 60 individual projects have been approved and details are available in my Department's 1999 Water and Sewerage Services Investment Programme Annual Report, a copy of which is available in the Library.</P>
      <P>In addition, £420 million is being made available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the rural water programme, which includes a number of measures to improve and expand rural water supplies and waste water facilities. Under the small schemes measure, Exchequer grants of up to 75% of cost, subject to a cost limit of £250,000 per scheme, are available for small public water and sewerage schemes. Responsibility for the selection of individual projects, which are funded from annual block grant allocations by my Department to local authorities, has been devolved to the authorities themselves. I hope to announce details of this years block grant allocations shortly.</P>
      <P>In the past fortnight I have also introduced substantive improvements in the grants and subsidies available under the rural water programme for the development and improvement of group water supplies. The increased level of grant aid now available should ensure that many schemes that up to now might not have been financially viable will be able to proceed. The approval of grants for individual group scheme proposals is also a devolved function of the local authorities within annual block grant allocations by my Department. Block grants for group schemes this year will be announced at the same time as those for the small schemes measure.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he will take in view of the decision of the EU Commission to take legal action against Ireland arising from the failure to comply with EU directives regarding water quality and asbestos; the other directives, if any, in the envir onment area in respect of which the Commission has opened infringement proceedings against Ireland; the steps being taken to ensure that the requirements of the two directives are met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A press release by the European Commission on 11 January 2000, <i>inter alia,</i> indicated its intention to initiate proceedings concerning drinking water quality problems associated with private group water schemes and the adequacy of national regulations, having regard to the requirements of Directive 80/778/EEC. Formal notification of proceedings has not been received in my Department. A record £420 million is being provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for a vigorous rural water programme which is comprised of a number of targeted initiatives to improve water quality and protect vulnerable sources from pollution. On 27 March I announced details of a new capital grants package, involving a substantial restructuring of the capital grant assistance for group schemes. The revamped grant and subsidy package will facilitate the upgrading of quality deficient groups and the provision of essential water disinfection and filtration equipment. I will shortly make regulations to impose more specific and stringent requirements on suppliers, public and private, of drinking water to ensure compliance with prescribed quality standards.</P>
      <P>The Commission initiated court proceedings in respect of the incomplete transposition of Article 7 of Directive 87/217/EEC on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos on 27 January 2000. This is now the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. However, I understand that new European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 74 of 2000), which implement Article 7, were made by the Tánaiste on 23 March.</P>
      <P>Proceedings have been initiated before the European Court of Justice in respect of the failure to implement Directive 75/442/EEC, as amended, on waste, Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and Directive 94/62/EC on packaging waste, with regard to the making of waste management plans. Ireland was originally given until 13 January 2000 to lodge a defence. The Attorney General's office, with the support of the Commission, formally requested an extension of time which would allow the now advanced waste management planning process to be fully completed. An extension to 24 March 2000 was granted by the court and a defence has now been lodged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proceedings were initiated before the European Court of Justice in respect of failure to implement Directive 97/68/EC concerning emissions of pollutants from engines in non-road mobile machinery. My colleague, the Minister of <Col N="1131" /> State, Deputy Dan Wallace, made the European Communities (Control of Emissions of Gaseous and Particulate Pollutants from Non-Road Mobile Machinery) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 396 of 1999) on 14 December 1999. These fully transpose the directive into Irish law. As a result, the European Court of Justice informed Ireland on 17 March 2000, that the Commission is discontinuing the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Proceedings at an earlier stage, by way of reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the Treaty on European Union, have been notified to Ireland by the Commission in relation to specific issues arising under Directive 76/464/EEC on the protection of water against pollution by dangerous substances, Directive 75/442/EC, and amendments, on compliance with waste legislation and Directive 91/692/EEC on the submission of reports on the implementation of water directives. A reply has issued in each case and the Commission response is awaited.</P>

      <Quest> the initiative, if any, she has taken to introduce motor insurance premia discounts for young drivers who are non-drinkers, have obtained certification in advanced driving skills or have other features which demonstrate their lower risk status; if any insurance companies have agreed to adopt reduced loadings of this nature; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. The difficulties being experienced by young people in securing motor insurance and, indeed, the high cost of compulsory insurance cover for motorists, in particular young drivers, is, I understand, directly attributable to adverse claims experience of young, especially male, drivers as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers is twice that for the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group are responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was a major initiative aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The board, whose expanded membership includes a member representing young drivers' interests, has undertaken an ambitious programme of work and <Col N="1132" /> research, particularly in relation to the basis of charges to young drivers.</P>
    <P>The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver. Learner drivers who undertake 25 hours of driving instruction from a registered DIR tutor receive a certificate which will qualify them for a first grade on the no claims bonus ladder with motor insurers which are members of the Irish Insurance Federation. After five years of accident free driving, it is estimated that the young driver can save over £1,000 in his/her first five years of driving.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. A number of initiatives to improve standards of driving and appreciation of road safety are in place. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce the changes you suggest <Col N="1135" /> as to do so might unfairly disadvantage other categories of participants on community employment schemes. The primary purpose of CE as an active labour market measure is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. The Deloitte &amp; Touche evaluation of CE, undertaken in 1998, set a framework for a reform of the programme for the years ahead. It recommended that there should be a reduction in participation on the programme over time, as well as a range of other reforms aimed at enhancing its effectiveness. The restructuring of CE, which was approved by Government in July 1999 and was based on the recommendations of Deloitte &amp; Touche, is set against a background of significant employment growth and unemployment reductions and is aimed at securing better targeting and outcomes from the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The presence of sole in the Suir estuary is due to tidal factors and the state of the stock there is accordingly dependent on sole stocks in the Celtic Sea generally.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute undertakes detailed assessments of Celtic Sea stocks on an ongoing basis and in its most recent report, 1999, has advanced the view that the stock of Celtic Sea sole is currently outside safe biological limits. Available data does, however, indicate the occurrence of large numbers of juvenile sole in the stock due to a very good spawning in 1998. These sole will enter the commercial catches from 2001 onwards with potential benefits to commercial catches in inshore and estuarine areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no specific management regime in place for inshore fisheries such as the Suir Estu<Col N="1137" /> ary at present but my decision to establish a National Inshore Fisheries Management Group will result in this issue being addressed at an early date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in communication with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Health and Safety Authority in regard to safety in groundhandling activities and a meeting between these two bodies and officials of my Department will take place in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, is the regulatory body responsible for the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation. Aircraft operators are <Col N="1139" /> responsible to the IAA for ensuring that the groundhandling services they have contracted for are properly and safely rendered and the IAA monitors the activities of the airlines in this regard. The IAA has not expressed any concerns to me regarding the adequacy of current regulation from a safety point of view and, accordingly, it is not my intention to extend their remit at this time. A decision in this regard would in any case be premature in the light of the forthcoming discussions in the matter.</P>
    <P>Five applications for approval to supply groundhandling services at Irish airports have been received in my Department. Three approvals have been issued. No such application has been received from the company referred to by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under European Union air transport liberalisation measures, any air carrier licensed by a European Economic Area (EEA) Member State, i.e., the 15 member states of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland, may introduce air services on any route within the EEA without any Government or EU controls, subject only to the availability of airport slots at either end of the route and, of course, to overall safety considerations. There is no obligation on carriers to notify the EU member states of the flights which they are operating or propose to operate. As a result, I would not necessarily be aware of every flight entering or leaving Irish airports.</P>
      <P>The regional airports are privately owned and managed. The Deputy should contact the airports concerned who should be in a position to supply him with the information he is seeking.</P>

      <P>I regret the delay in responding to the earlier correspondence. Under EU Regulations governing the quota regime, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven are required to use at least 90% of that quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve. Farmers who are unable to use the quota themselves may lease out the quota as quota leased out is regarded as quota used. Normally quota may only be leased out for a maximum of three years but farmers who are participating in the early retirement scheme may lease out for a longer period.</P>
      <P>The person named held a suckler cow quota of 20 premium rights but did not use or lease out any quota in 1999. She could have leased out her quota in 1999 irrespective of her application to join the early retirement scheme. However, having considered all the circumstances, I am pleased to say that she may retain her quota of 20 premium rights for the year 2000. She may therefore, sell her quota or she may lease it for the duration of her participation in the early retirement scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named has recently furnished the outstanding proof of commonage to the area aid unit and her area aid application has now been processed. The person named claimed a total of 79.14 hectares on her 1999 area aid application. An area of 79.04 hectares has been determined. This represents a difference of 0.10 hectares or 0.13% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%. Therefore in this case no penalty is applied, leaving the area for payment purposes at 79.04 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Based on the information available to me I am satisfied that normal pasteurisation methods applied within the Irish Dairy industry are sufficient to kill the bacterium referred to. It is my understanding that while the DNA of the organism can occasionally be detected, the mycobacterium has never been cultured from commercially pasteurised milk. This would indicate that commercial pasteurisation of milk kills the bacterium.</P>
      <P>A recent report from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland does not recommend any alteration to the current normal pasteurisation methods. A study undertaken by my Department's Central Veterinary Research Laboratory last year failed to find any trace of microbacterium paratuberculosis in a total of 77 samples of pasteurised milk and 319 samples of raw milk tested for the organism. The results of studies and research in this area will continue to be monitored.</P>

    <P>In exceptional circumstances, a higher level of fee has been sanctioned for chairpersons of particular State bodies usually in the light of a substantially higher than normal time commitment being required of the chairperson concerned.</P>

      <Quest>when he will remove the anomaly in relation to the £3,000 allowance agreed after budget 2000 as a support for spouses working in the home where a non-married partner who works in the home is not entitled to the allowance where a family arises from adults who are not formally married.</Quest>

      <P>The home carer's allowance is a new tax allowance of up to £3,000 per annum at the standard rate of income tax, 22% for 2000-2001. It may be claimed by married couples, who are jointly assessed and where one spouse, the &ldquo;home carer&rdquo; cares for one or more dependent persons which includes children, the aged or incapacitated persons. Full details of the new allowance are set out in the Finance Bill, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> The new allowance was brought in the context of the changes to single and married persons income tax bands in the budget. Couples who are not married are not eligible for married treatment under the income tax code, therefore, they are also not eligible for the new allowance. I have no plans to change the allowance in the way suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>if he will introduce a tax incentive to encourage people to invest in windfarms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 62 of the Finance Act 1998 provides for tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects. To qualify for the relief the energy project must be in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories, and be approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise. The relief takes the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits for an investment in new ordinary shares in a company setting up a renewable energy project. The relief is capped at 50% of all capital expenditure, excluding land, net of grants, or £7.5 million for a single project. Investment by a company or group is capped at £10 million per annum, and unless the shares are held for at least five years by the company the relief will be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following clearance of the scheme by the European Commission, I made an order providing that the relief would come into operation from 18 March 1999 for a three year period. I understand that while this relief was designed for corporate investment, individuals can also invest <Col N="1149" /> in renewable energy through a limited partnership structure.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I remind the Deputy of a provision in this year's Finance Act which has an impact on the availability of the relief to individuals involved in a partnership structure.</P>
    <P>As a result of an abuse of the right to offset losses, interest and capital allowances of limited partnerships against non-partnership income, I brought forward measures to curtail the use of such partnership losses. Section 70 of the Finance Act, 2000 restricts the application of this set-off, as it applies to non-active partners in partnerships, so that in future, relief for losses etc. will only be available for set off against income arising to the partnership and will be subject to an upper limit equal to the capital contribution to the partnership.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of investment in renewal energy, I included transitional arrangements, in section 70, which allow for expenditure incurred under an obligation entered into before 1 March 2001 to be excluded from this restriction. These arrangements are very reasonable in the circumstances and I have no plans to make further changes in this area at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a long service increment was withheld from a person (details supplied) in Dublin 14; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that his Department's guidelines regarding the payment of long service increments appear not to have been followed in this case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in accordance with Department of Finance circulars, a long service increment, as with any salary increment, is granted provided an officer's services are satisfactory. In the case in question the increment was withheld because the officer's services were unsatisfactory and this had previously been brought to his attention. The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the correct procedures have been adhered to in this case.</P>

      <P>With regard to the sale of hospital lands in Ardee, on 16 August 1988 the North Eastern Health Board agreed to sell its farm at Curraghbeg Ardee to Anglo Irish Beef Packers Limited (AIBP) FOR £225,000. AIBP had promised to site an industry there, creating a significant number of jobs. A clause in the contract stated that the land would revert to the North Eastern Health Board at the same price should AIBP not proceed with their project within a certain time scale.</P>
      <P>AIBP did not proceed with the project and the NEHB re-purchased the farm for the same price.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the average and longest delays in the Blood Transfusion Service Board receiving donor HCV (hepatitis C) PCR testing results from Edinburgh; and whether blood or blood components have been released for patient usage without HCV PCR clearance since this testing was introduced.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10269/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current serological tests for hepatitis C are extremely robust and sensitive and are applied in respect of the release of all components at the BTSB. In addition, PCR testing is a further safeguard aimed at detecting hepatitis C during the window period between infection and the production of antibodies which are detected by the standard serological tests. The typical length of the window period without PCR testing is ten-14 weeks. Following introduction of PCR testing, this window period is reduced to approximately two weeks. To date, no donation has tested positive for hepatitis C by the PCR test.</P>
      <P>The introduction of PCR testing for hepatitis C is being applied internationally in response to the European committee for proprietary medicinal products (CPMP) requirement that all manufactured blood products released for use within the EU must be derived from plasma pools that have tested negative for hepatitis C by a validated PCR test. This requirement arose from the transmission of hepatitis C associated with HCV screened intravenous immunoglobulin products which involved plasma pools from numerous donors. PCR testing for other blood components is not mandatory. However, in order to further improve safety, PCR testing for the hepatitis C virus is currently performed on all blood donations collected by the Blood Transfusion Service Board. In November 1999, the BTSB entered a contract with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) to carry out PCR testing on its behalf and all donations after that date have been tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>PCR testing for blood components for individual patients e.g. plasma, red cells and platelets is being developed internationally on a phased basis. The use of PCR results as a release criteria for blood and blood products by the BTSB is being phased in as follows. At the present time, the majority of PCR test results are returned to the BTSB on the fourth day after the donation has been taken. The assay test format being used requires two to three working days in the laboratory after donation. A small number of samples require further analysis because of difficulties associated with this test. The test results are currently faxed to the BTSB. Electronic exchange of data when the BTSB's new computer system is implemented will improve turnaround time in transmission of results. In the case of platelets, which have a shelf life of five days, improvement in assay and turnaround times will be required before PCR test results can be used to determine <Col N="1155" /> release of these products. The BTSB and the SNBTS are committed to implementing PCR testing as one of the criteria for release of red cells later this year. From next month, PCR results will be used as one of the release criteria for fresh frozen plasma.</P>
    <P>Approximately 160,000 donations are tested annually by the BTSB. Donations found positive in serological tests are discarded and not issued. In the unlikely event that a PCR positive result is observed, e.g. a window period donation, appropriate follow up, including product recall, will be initiated. The risk of transmission of hepatitis C in the window period is currently estimated as one in 500,000. As already stated, no such reactive result has been observed to date.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority, is satisfied with the current position regarding the implementation of PCR testing by the BTSB. All mandatory tests are performed on all components before issue by the BTSB. The BTSB plan to perform PCR testing at its own laboratory at the National Blood Centre. It will be at least a year before the testing system is validated and becomes fully operational.</P>

      <P>A series of expenditure reviews on various Government programmes are being undertaken by the Department of Finance in association with the relevant Departments. The aims of the review process are: to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme; and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between programmes.</P>
      <P>An expenditure review on the nursing home subvention scheme commenced in March, 2000 and is scheduled to be completed by December, 2000.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95, £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional <Col N="1156" /> funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin is the national paediatric cardiac centre and my Department has been aware that there has been concern over waiting times for children in this specialty. The development of this specialty at the hospital has been the subject of discussions with my Department and the hospital for some time.</P>
      <P>Some of the measures cited by the hospital as contributing to the increasing pressure on this service were the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and advances in surgical and interventional techniques available.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 the hospital was allocated a sum of £500,00 from the cardiac waiting list initiative to implement measures aimed at reducing pressures in the most effective and appropriate manner. The hospital proposed to use the funding for a number of measures. These included the provision of an additional four ICU beds, the implementation of a training programme for ICU nurses and the purchase of cardiac procedures from appropriate UK paediatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>In 1998 and in 1999 under the same initiative the hospital was allocated sums of £878,550 and £679,000 respectively. In addition, approval for a third cardiac surgeon has issued, the recruitment procedure has been finalised and the selected candidate is expected to take up duty in July 2000.  Included in the hospital's allocation for 2000 is the provision of £700,000 to continue the initiative and the details of the funding will be discussed with the hospital in the context of its service plan for 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> It has been agreed that the hospital's cardiac surgical capacity should be increased and in this regard a design team for the theatre development has been appointed. When completed the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity.</P>
    <P>The prioritisation of the waiting list is a matter for the clinicians concerned and that immediate medical treatment is provided for all urgent cases. I am confident that the appointment of additional consultant staff and the completion of the theatre development will have a positive impact on the reduction of waiting times in this specialty.</P>

      <P>This drug was authorised in Ireland in 1983 for use in the &ldquo;treatment of cystic and conglobate forms of acne vulgarus or in those forms of severe acne which have failed to respond or rapidly relapse following adequate courses of accepted therapy&rdquo;. Under the terms of the product authorisation, its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a consultant dermatologist.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board and its experts have continuously reviewed the safety information regarding this drug and are of the opinion that the benefits of the drug to the patients outweigh the potential risks associated with its use. This position is in keeping with current opinion in other member states of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to more fully evaluate the ongoing safety and efficacy of this drug in Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board has recently requested the company concerned to undertake a post-marketing surveillance programme on its the use in this country. This programme will be used to re-evaluate the benefit-risk assessment of the drug. All dermatology specialists have been asked to monitor each patient using the drug and this infor<Col N="1161" /> mation will be reviewed by the Irish Medicines Board and action taken, as appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 79 of 26 January 2000. A study of road pricing and related issues with reference to the Dublin area was commissioned by my Department from a consortium of consultants led by Oscar Faber Group and published on 5 October 1999; a copy of the report on the study is available in the Oireachtas Library. The study offers a preliminary review of the potential for introducing new transport demand management measures in Dublin. The consultants conclude that road pricing could have a role to play in transport policy for Dublin; however, they also consider that the issue requires more detailed consideration in the context of an integrated approach to Dublin's transport requirements and that any future pricing initiative is likely to require balancing by a range of other measures.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office, has been asked to consider the study, in the context of the wider update of the DTI strategy now being finalised, and as an initial step has invited public comments and submissions in relation to it. Proposals for transport demand management will arise from this DTO work and will be considered by Government and/or other competent agencies.</P>
      <P>As regards taxation of employer provided car parking spaces in Dublin, my Department is participating in a group established by the Department of Finance to identify the practical measures in this area. In general, I expect that demand management measures will play an increasingly important role in ensuring transport infrastructure is used in an efficient, effective and environmentally sustainable manner.</P>

      <P>While local authorities have not sought changes to the current competitive tendering system, I am aware that the buoyancy in the construction industry has given rise to difficulties in the tendering process for construction works in general, local authority housing being no exception. This has been evident over the last few years from the reduced number of contractors submitting tenders and escalating tender prices.</P>
      <P>Chapter 4 of the report of the strategic review committee, on the construction industry, June 1997, dealt with building procurement for construction projects in general, and contained recommendations on tendering procedures, paragraphs 4.13 to 4.25. It is planned to implement these recommendations with effect from 1 September 2000, subject to the agreement of the implementation details by the forum for the construction industry in June 2000. A copy of the SRC report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The provision of a fire service, including emergency and rescue equipment, is a matter for the local fire authorities to deal with in accordance with section 10 of the Fire Services Act, 1981. My Department, however, assists fire authorities by providing capital grants towards expenditure they incur in the purchase of such equipment.</P>

    <P>Approval issued to Kilkenny County Council on 22 February 2000 to accept tenders for the supply of road traffic accident rescue equipment <Col N="1163" /> amounting to £47,041, including delivery and extras. Other applications for grant aid, amounting to over £68,000, received from the council for the purchase of handportable radios and chemical protection items are currently being considered by the Department having regard to the level of funding available for the fire services capital programme and the competing demands on those funds.

      <P>My Department recoups 90% of expenditure incurred by local authorities on the pro<Col N="1166" /> vision of accommodation for homeless people and 100% of their expenditure on the provision of emergency accommodation for asylum seekers. Recoupments paid in 1999 amounted to £22.195 million of which £9.957 million was in respect of accommodation for homeless persons and £12.238 million in respect of emergency accommodation for asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A provision of £20 million has been included in the Department's Estimates for the year 2000 for the payment of recoupments in respect of homeless people and asylum seekers. It is not <Col N="1167" /> possible, at this stage, to estimate what the outturn for the year 2000 will be but in the event of recoupment claims exceeding £20 million additional resources will be provided.</P>

      <P>The type of accommodation suitable to meet the needs of homeless persons varies from hostel accommodation to standard local authority housing and it is difficult, therefore, to give a meaningful estimation across the range of accommodation types and locations etc. It is estimated that suitable supportive type accommodation in a unit to cater for 20 single homeless persons would cost in the region of £1 million. A programme to provide a significant number of such units would take a number of years and costs would increase accordingly.</P>

In some instances, where, for example, a household is made homeless due to an emergency such as fire etc., they may be re-housed almost immediately. In other instances, it can take longer having regard to local circumstances.</P>

      <P>In relation to the provision of affordable housing in Kildare, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 247 to 249, inclusive, of 29 February 2000. The position has not changed.</P>
      <P>Details regarding the affordable housing scheme have been requested from all local authorities, including Kildare, as part of overall monitoring of the scheme. Details of activity under the scheme, such as numbers of houses completed, commenced and in progress will be available on a quarterly basis, similar to other social housing schemes, and will be published in my Department's quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletin commencing with the March 2000 quarterly bulletin.</P>
      <P>The affordable housing scheme was launched in March 1999 and some 40 houses were completed under the scheme by the end of the year. To date, a further 124 houses are under construction and approximately 1,800 are at various stages of planning.</P>
      <P>The allocation of dwellings under the affordable housing scheme is a matter for individual local authorities and such information is not available in my Department.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that Kildare County Council is receiving sufficient funding to support its responsibilities in relation to the non-national road network.</P>
      <P>Kildare County Council has received significant and increasing non-national road grants from my Department in recent years &ndash; £5.062 million in 1997, £6.94 million in 1998, £7.698 million in 1999 and £9.322 million in 2000. The 2000 grant allocation represents an 84% increase on the 1997 grant payment. In the period from 1997 to 2000 the council's improvement grant has increased from £2.894 million to £4.374 million. Maintenance grants have increased from £773,000 to £1.11 million.</P>
      <P>It is intended that these grants, together with the local authorities' own resources, should provide for the ongoing and special needs of local authorities, including requirements arising from exceptional weather conditions. My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads provides that the cost of remedial works necessitated by such conditions must be met from the above resources and that local authorities should set aside a contingency sum to finance these works.</P>

      <P>The recently published air quality monitoring annual report, 1998 from the Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library &ndash; indicates <Col N="1170" /> that the highest levels of sulphur dioxide &ndash; SO2 &ndash; measured over the period April 1998 to March 1999 were recorded at the Leixlip monitoring station. Readings of SO2 at the Leixlip monitoring station are the maximum for all stations in the country for all parameters &ndash; between three and five times higher than the average and between two and three times higher than the levels recorded in Leixlip in 1997-98, depending on the measurement parameter.</P>
      <P>In the case of levels of smoke, the readings for Leixlip were within the range of readings for other stations, but above average for all parameters for 1998-99, by between 16% and 26%.</P>
      <P>The Leixlip readings, and those at all other monitored areas in the county, remain in compliance with the mandatory national and EU air quality standards for smoke and SO2. Air quality monitoring in County Kildare is a function of Kildare County Council under the Air Pollution Act (No. 6 of 1987) and it is a matter for the council to identify the reason for the abnormal readings for SO2 for 1998. Ongoing investigations of the Leixlip readings for SO2 by the council, including investigation of the possibility of a faulty monitor and a survey of local fuel use, have not, to date, identified the reason for the anomalous levels recorded.</P>

      <P>The provision of a fire service, including firefighting equipment, is a matter for the local fire authorities in accordance with section 10 of the Fire Services Act, 1981. My Department, however, assists fire authorities by providing capital grants towards expenditure they incur in the purchase of such equipment.</P>
      <P>In carrying out their functions, fire authorities employ a range of specialist equipment for their firefighting and rescue roles. Front-line fire engines carry a relatively consistent set of equipment for deployment at a diverse range of incidents and this equipment is updated and expanded in accordance with developments in needs and advances in technology.</P>
      <P>The use of self-contained breathing apparatus &ndash; BA &ndash; has been an integral part of fire brigade operations for many years enabling firefighters to carry out operations safely and effectively in toxic and irrespirable atmospheres. My Department issued draft guidelines for the use of BA in 1981 and re-issued an updated and expanded version, The Use of Breathing Apparatus in the Fire Service, in December 1995. All new firefighters are required to undergo and pass a specific two week training course in BA wearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> In view of the fundamental importance of this equipment, my Department has provided grant aid to fire authorities to purchase BA and other special equipment over the years. The Department, generally, does not fund replacement of first generation equipment and fire authorities have replaced and updated BA sets themselves, in line with their own needs. The Department's role, at this stage, is confined to occasionally grant-aiding authorities who wish to expand the number of BA sets in use.</P>

      <P>The annual property survey undertaken by the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute indicates that in 1999 rents for residential accommodation increased by some 13% nationally and by 15% in Dublin. Current high levels of housing demand have resulted in significant increases in house prices and rents in the private rented housing sector.</P>
      <P>The key to more affordable rents in the private rented sector is, in the final analysis, the same as that for stabilising the housing market as a whole, namely, an increased supply of housing. The Government is acutely aware of the difficulties being encountered in the housing market at present and has taken a number of steps to restore the balance between supply and demand. As a result, a record number of over 46,500 new dwellings were completed last year and the rate of increase in house prices has begun to moderate. The Government's priority is to maximise the supply of housing to meet demand in all housing tenures and in that regard we have set out an ambitious plan to provide 500,000 new dwellings over the coming ten years. I am confident that as supply and demand levels converge we will see a consequential lessening in the rate of rent increases.</P>

      <P>The cornerstone of the Government's <Col N="1172" /> housing strategy is to increase the supply of housing across all tenures including, in particular, social and affordable housing. I introduced a range of measures in Action on House Prices &ndash; April 1998 &ndash; and Action on the Housing Market &ndash; March 1999 &ndash; to accelerate the provision of additional housing supply and bring balance to the housing market. I have recently commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates, economic consultants, to undertake a general review of housing market developments since the introduction by the Government of these measures and to carry out an evaluation of recent developments in housing demand, housing supply and house prices. The review has been commenced and it is envisaged that it will be concluded by the end of May. I anticipate that the results of the review will be considered urgently by Government and then published together with an appropriate response. I have also established a housing supply unit in my Department to ensure urgent and effective delivery of the housing supply measures and to identify any additional measures that might be put in place to further increase housing supply.</P>
      <P>In response to increased need I have significantly expanded the local authority housing programme to provide 22,000 additional local authority house starts over a four year multi-annual programme, 2000-03. The multi-annual nature of the programme will enable the more effective planning and implementation of local authority housing delivery. I am also committed to assisting the voluntary housing sector to increase output over the period of the national development plan to reach a level of 4,000 units of accommodation per year. Improvements to the terms and conditions of the voluntary housing schemes have been introduced on a number of occasions, most recently last October.</P>
      <P>The Government has allocated £6 billion to social and affordable housing in the national development plan which will ensure that the social housing needs of over 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the plan period.</P>

      <P>The main threat to water quality in Irish rivers and lakes is considered to be eutrophication arising from excessive inputs to waters of phosphorus from agriculture, industry, sewage treatment plants and other sources. Specific targets for improvement in water quality are set by the phosphorus regulations which I made in 1998 <Col N="1173" /> and which prescribe water quality standards to be achieved by end 2007.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency undertakes a wide range of advisory, licensing, monitoring, promotional, reporting, research and other activities to protect and improve water quality and is participating in the major catchment-based water quality management projects in relation to Loughs Derg and Ree, Lough Leane and the Rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir. The agency is required, in carrying out its functions under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and other enactments, to have regard to the need for a high standard of environmental protection and to keep itself informed of the policies and objectives of public authorities with related functions. The agency is also prohibited by the 1992 Act from granting a licence under the Act in relation to an activity unless it is satisfied that emissions from the activity will comply with, or will not result in a contravention of, prescribed quality standards for water.</P>
      <P>The agency is an independent statutory body in the exercise of its statutory functions. The Minister is precluded by the 1992 Act from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by the agency of any function assigned to it by or under the Act.</P>

      <P>The monitoring of air quality is a local authority function under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, having regard to the statutory national air quality standards for sulphur dioxide, suspended particulates, nitrogen dioxide and lead set down in the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Air Quality Standards) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 244 of 1987). The monitoring of ozone is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) having regard to the thresholds set out in the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Ozone) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 132 of 1997). The siting of the monitors for the foregoing networks is <Col N="1174" /> identified in the annual EPA air quality monitoring report and a copy of the most recent report &ndash; 1998 &ndash; has been placed in the Oireachtas Library. This collates and provides an overview of the main local authority and agency data. More detailed data and analysis may be sourced from the relevant local authorities or the EPA, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>In addition, the provision of data from stations operated by the Electricity Supply Board at Turlough Hill, County Wicklow, the Burren, County Clare and the Ridge of Capard, County Laois and by Met Éireann at Valentia Observatory, County Kerry, under the national quality assurance managership of the EPA, constitute Ireland's participation in the UNECE Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-Range Transmission of Air Pollution in Europe &ndash; EMEP Programme &ndash; under which a range of air pollutants is monitored.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of ambient air quality as a condition of a licence granted under part III of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, or of an integrated pollution control licence under part IV of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, is a matter for the relevant local authorities or the EPA, as appropriate, and the licensee in accordance with the terms of the licence. With regard to the findings of the EPA's 1998 annual report, I refer to the replies to an earlier question today and Question No. 592 of 26 January 2000.</P>

      <P>The statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Social Service Board. The Pensions Board was established in December 1990 under the Pensions Act, 1990, and comprises 15 members including the chairperson. The legislation provides for the payment of fees to members of the board. The level of fees were fixed in December 1991 by agreement with the Department of Finance. These amount to £2,000 per annum for the chairperson and £1,000 per annum for the ordinary members of the board (excluding the two civil servant members).</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency &ndash; CPA &ndash; was established in September 1986 under the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986. The board currently comprises 16 members. Under the legislation, no remuneration other than travelling and subsistence allowance can be paid to members of the board.</P>
      <P>The National Social Service Board was established in September 1984 under the National Social Service Board Act, 1984. The existing board comprises a chairperson and 19 ordinary members. There are no fees payable, other than travelling and subsistence allowance, to either the chairman or ordinary members of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation &ndash; Comhairle Act, 2000 &ndash; for the establishment of a new organisation called Comhairle has recently been passed. This new organisation will be responsible for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services for all citizens throughout the country, including people with disabilities. It will combine the National Social Service Board &ndash; NSSB &ndash; with relevant functions of the National Rehabilitation Board &ndash; NRB. It is my intention to set up the new body shortly and I will be appointing the existing NSSB board as the first board of Comh<Col N="1176" /> airle. Provision is made in the Comhairle Act for the payment of fees to board members by agreement with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a range of grants schemes and programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs. To be eligible for funding, groups must subscribe to a self-help community development ethos and must involve intended beneficiaries in the management and design of the project. Grants are not available from my Department towards services that are deemed the responsibility of other Departments or statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants to voluntary organisations operated by my Department provides once-off grants to voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas, towards renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications, research or other special projects. The types of groups eligible for funding under this scheme are community development and area development organisations, family support groups, welfare rights and information groups, mutual support and self-help organisations and co-ordinating and umbrella organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All groups seeking funding under this and other grants schemes operated by my Department are required to have an anti-poverty focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. In assessing applications received under the various schemes, my Department does not distinguish <Col N="1177" /> between disability groups and other groups but takes account of the extent to which each group, and the particular project for which funding is sought, addresses such poverty and exclusion. In allocating funding it is also necessary to take account of the overall demands under the schemes and the level of funding available to meet these demands.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that the Dublin North regional office of my Department received two applications for funding from the group indicated in the Deputy's question. As a large number of applications have been received and will take time to process, it is not possible to indicate at this stage if funding can be allocated to the group under this year's schemes. However, my Department will be in touch with the group in due course regarding their applications.</P>

      <Quest>the payments made to asylum seekers in the past few years, including details of individual entitlements and level of supplementary emergency assistance in total or on average including and excluding housing; and if he will engage in a public information campaign in relation to services, facilities and entitlements being made in order to dispel the urban myths going around about payments being made to them.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; system on behalf of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Payment is made in accordance with the relevant legislation as long as the person is resident in the State. Payments to asylum seekers are made on the same basis as payments to other recipients.</P>
      <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation. Where a person in full board accommodation receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child. Furthermore, as is the case with all persons who are resident in the State where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments &ndash; ENP &ndash; will be made by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum seekers who have not been provided with full board accommodation and who have no <Col N="1178" /> other means qualify for the full standard rate of weekly SWA. This amounts to £72 per week for a single adult, £115.20 per week for a couple and £13.20 per week for a dependent child. Asylum seekers who live in private rented accommodation qualify for rent supplement on the same basis as other recipients. For example, a single person living in Dublin can receive up to £64 per week towards rent, while a family can receive up to £155 per week, depending on the number of people in the family.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these payments to asylum seekers was £35 million in 1999. This comprised of £23 million in basic weekly payments, £10.5 million in rent supplements and approximately £1.5 million in exceptional needs payments. The amount of exceptional needs payments made in individual cases varies according to the needs of the people concerned but typically could amount to £100 where clothing and footwear were needed. Total expenditure was £12 million in 1997 and £22 million in 1998. It is not possible to provide more detailed statistics for earlier years as payments were not fully computerised.</P>
    <P>Since 1998 some 2021 asylum seekers have been awarded child benefit in respect of 3,276 children. No separate details were kept of asylum seekers claims prior to 1998. The monthly rate of child benefit is £34.50 for the first and second child increasing to £46 for third and subsequent children. In addition a small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of one parent family payment at the weekly rate of £88.70 for an adult and one dependant child. The payment is increased by £15.20 for the second and any subsequent child dependant.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that overall co-ordination in relation to services for asylum seekers is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, my Department is in regular contact with the media and Non-Governmental Organisations &ndash; NGOs &ndash; concerning the entitlements of asylum seekers under the various schemes of my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 139, 144, 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of crossing of Kerry cattle with Highland cattle and other breeds lost from Ireland is to reinstate fitter cattle breeds that previously thrived in highland conditions in Ireland. The reinstated breeds will be better adapted to the climatic conditions in the upland areas of Killarney National Park and will help to restore the original vegetation on the mountain. These measures are wholly in keeping with the conservation ethos of Killarney National Park as outlined in the management plan for the park. The genetic experiments are part of the ongoing management of Killarney National Park and do not reflect any change in priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> The purpose of the enclosure in the Ferta area of the Killarney National Park is to facilitate the control and maintenance of cattle grazing in the upland area of the park. This grazing regime is exploring how to maintain the bio-diversity of this habitat and is being done on a step by step basis. Electric fencing has to be erected to control the movement of cattle. Permanent fencing does not give the control and versatility required in such a visually sensitive environment.</P>
    <P>The cattle &ndash; 190 Kerry cattle and 34 of other breeds &ndash; being grazed in the Knockreer Demesne and in the west meadow area of Killarney National Park are the property of Killarney National Park. I understand, however, that for a two and a half month period during this winter, approximately nine cattle belonging to the Muckross Traditional Farm grazed the west meadow area. The grazing numbers are consistent with the numbers required to manage the pasture to the standard required by the REPS. The purpose of the grazing regime is to maintain the bio-diversity of the grassland habitats. The removal of heavy grasses by the cattle facilitates deer feeding as deer are intermediate feeders and the cattle are roughage feeders. The grazing regime, therefore, has a beneficial effect on the deer herd. Research is carried out on an ongoing basis by qualified Dúchas staff. All the environmental issues at Knockreer are being monitored to maintain the proper balance between pasture, woodland, cattle and deer.</P>
    <P>As Killarney National Park comprises State-owned land Dúchas does not draw down State funds under the REPS. I understand, however, that Dúchas follows the REPS guidelines in relation to pasture management in Killarney National Park and has sought advice from Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with regard to fertiliser applications.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Dúchas head office has discontinued its policy of meeting a group (details supplied) in County Kerry in accordance with the principles of the Rio declaration which requires Government conservation bodies to engage in consultation with local groups and committees; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It has been a regular practice for a number of years for officials of Dúchas to meet interested local groups in County Kerry and elsewhere to discuss national parks issues. Some of these meetings are attended by local officials and some are also attended by officials from Dúchas head office. The demand for such meetings and consultation with local groups is increasing and I have encouraged this and indeed I have sought to extend and formalise <Col N="1183" /> this process to other areas of Dúchas operations throughout the country particularly in relation to setting up local liaison committees for special areas of conservation.</P>
      <P>It is not practical for headquarters personnel to attend all meetings around the country and Dúchas management has decided that where possible such meetings should be serviced by local staff who in practice will have greater knowledge of the issues. Dúchas regional manager in Killarney is available to meet the group referred to by the Deputy and the group's chairperson was advised of this by letter on 23 March 1999. The regional manager has had informal discussions with some members of the group since that date but I understand that they have not sought a formal meeting with Dúchas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 143 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>Deer are culled by the staff of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, in Killarney National Park according to the needs of the herd and the requirements of other habitats in the park covered by the EU Habitats Directive. The deer populations on the mountains and on the lowlands are continually monitored and the cull numbers are based on the results of this work. The latest deer census figures in Killarney National Park are as follows: Red&ndash;Uplands, 500-700; Red&ndash;Lowlands, 300-400; Sika Population, 700-800.</P>
      <P>The numbers of red deer culled in Killarney National Park during the years 1995-00 are as follows: 1995-96, 3; 1996-97, 20; 1997-98, 43; 1998-99, 45; 1999-2000; 42; Total, 153.</P>
      <P>I understand that 17 red deer have been culled to date this year in Knockreer and in the Muckross Peninsula.</P>
      <P>The two oval embankments referred to in Question No. 147 facilitate the live capture of deer within the Muckross Peninsula. Deer control has been carried out in Killarney National Park for almost 30 years. The traditional method of controlling deer populations was the use of firearms but due to the closeness of the deer to areas of human habitation enclosures are now used which are considered more effective as the deer captured in the enclosures can be humanely destroyed or transported live to an alternative location. Research in this area is carried out on an ongoing basis by qualified Dúchas staff. These enclosures represent the implementation of known control technologies in keeping with the behaviour of the animals and their environment. Planning permission was not required for the provision of the enclosures in question.</P>
      <P>The regional staff of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, are available to meet with the Deer Society and the Killarney Nature Conservation Group to discuss any matters of concern to them. I understand that no such meeting was requested in relation to the deer enclosures.</P>

      <P>At the outset I must point out that the property at Moorehall is in the ownership of Coillte Teoranta rather than my Department and as such its upkeep and future use is a matter in the first instance for that organisation. Having said that I am fully aware of the continuing commitment of the local community to the project and to the fact that Mayo County Council also remains firm in its support. In this regard, I would like to record my admiration for all the work which has been carried out locally to bring the project to the stage it is at presently.</P>
      <P>However, there are a number of issues concerning Moorehall which need to be studied before the project could be advanced further by any of the aforementioned organisations. To this end I have made funding available to enable a survey of the ruin to be undertaken and to assess the cost of consolidation and of complete replication. At the same time as this survey is being undertaken it is essential that the local community commence the process of the preparation of a full business plan for the project. Only when the survey and business plan are complete could the possibility of further State involvement in the project be considered.</P>

      <Quest>the number of children born in the past four years to parents either of which had an application pending for asylum status; the number of marriages in the past four years where either of the couple had an application pending for asylum status; and if there is any benefit or advantage to an applicant for asylum if he or she has been married within the State.</Quest>

      <P>The administration of the registration system for births and marriages is a matter for the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. I understand that the details to be recorded in the register of births are set out in legislation and do not include the nationality of the parents or whether they are asylum applicants. Similarly, the information registered in respect of a marriage does not include these details.</P>
      <P>I can, however, advise the Deputy that in the period 1996 to March 2000 my Department has granted permission to remain to 1,873 current or former asylum applicants on the basis that they were the parents of children born in Ireland &ndash; Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> I can further advise the Deputy that in the period 1998 to March, 2000 permission to remain has been granted to 194 current or former asylum applicants on the basis of their marriage to an Irish citizen. Statistics in this regard for years prior to 1998 are not readily available.</P>
    <P>In line with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Fajujonu case, subject to the common good, a non-national who marries or becomes the parent of an Irish citizen has a strong claim to be allowed reside in the State with that citizen. Marriage in the State, whether to an Irish citizen or otherwise, and parentage of an Irish child do not confer any benefits in so far as the asylum determination process is concerned.</P>

      <P>My reply to the Deputy on 16 November 1999 fully set out how the priority list for the building and major refurbishment of Garda stations is compiled, and the consultation that is undertaken before agreement on the list is recorded.</P>
      <P>Moreover, I explained how works to some stations can be undertaken out of sequence for the reasons stated. In that connection, Ballinrobe's position on the list has not changed significantly since that reply. There are 12/13 Garda stations with a higher priority that have yet to be addressed.</P>
      <P>As to the matters raised in the remainder of the Deputy's question, such matters are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works. I understand from that office that the building of a new Garda station in Ballinrobe will be progressed as far as is feasible in accordance with the agreed priority list, and to a timeframe determined by overall Garda building priorities and the availability of resources.</P>

It is presumed that the filed plan which issued on 24 January 2000 is that which the Deputy states was issued on 31 January 2000. The copy filed plan as issued shows the correct boundaries. However, part of the filed plan is issued on a 25 inch scale and part is issued on a six inch scale. The reason for this is that no 25 inch scale map has been published in respect of the portion shown on the six inch scale.</P>

      <P>The transnational placement scheme in question is operated as part of the EU Leonardo da Vinci programme which is administered on behalf of my Department by Léargas &ndash; The Exchange Bureau.</P>
      <P>I understand from Léargas that student placement projects under the Leonardo da Vinci programme last for two years, promoters being awarded a set level of funding to support an agreed number of beneficiaries. This funding is paid by the European Commission to the project promoter in three tranches, consequent on the signing of the contract and the acceptance of interim and final reports, respectively. Project promoters pay individual grants to student beneficiaries in a similar fashion, having received payment from the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> In relation to the case raised by the Deputy, 90% of the grant has been paid to the student involved. However, I understand that the Commission had sought additional information from the project promoter in relation to the final report in this case and that payment of the final instalment has consequently been delayed. My Department will endeavour, through Léargas, to ensure that the matter is finalised as quickly as possible in order to facilitate payment of the outstanding 10% of grant support due to the student in question.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): At present, of the total of 752 schools at second level, 211 schools have disadvantaged status and have been invited to participate in the home-school-community liaison scheme this year.</P>
    <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Educational Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16% of the school going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17% of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the position of this school will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged and home-school-community liaison schemes.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently in the process of planning to extend the range of data gathered as part of the development of a comprehensive database on individual primary school pupils. The new database will provide critical information to support the implementation of policies and will also provide data for research and policy development purposes.</P>
      <P>At present, my Department does not have a comprehensive database on pupils in the primary school sector and unfortunately therefore, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of a database on all primary school pupils is a very significant undertaking <Col N="1202" /> involving the collection and processing of information on 450,000 pupils from more than 3,300 primary schools. It will take at least three years to put the full database in place and an allocation of £4.5 million has been provided for this purpose over the next three years, including £500,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>The IT unit of my Department is currently preparing a development plan for the project and it is intended to implement a first phase in a pilot group of schools during the coming school year.</P>
    <P>In addition the Deputy may also be aware that the Education (Welfare) Bill, which is currently being considered in committee in this House, will provide a new framework to address issues generally related to school attendance. The Bill provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board, with a general responsibility to ensure that &ldquo;each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a prescribed minimum education&rdquo;. The legislation makes specific provision to track the attendance of all children at first and second-level, and particularly in the transition between first and second-level. The legislation will also include specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system. It is my hope that this legislation will be enacted before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>Apprentice numbers have expanded significantly in recent years with the result that the total number of apprentices registered is now over 21,000.</P>
      <P>The need for additional capacity in institutes of technology to cater for these increases is being addressed in conjunction with the institutes. A major capital investment programme to provide additional capacity is in train and my Department has provided the Institutes with additional resources to enable them to expand existing programmes where possible. Extra staff have been sanctioned and additional funding is being provided to meet the cost of extra courses. In the two financial years 1998 and 1999 a total of £6 million of additional recurrent funding was provided to fund additional courses. A further £5 million is being provided this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the measures taken to date, the number of apprentices catered for in the edu<Col N="1203" /> cational system has increased from just over 4000 in 1997-98 to 7,200 in the current academic year. However, the substantial increase in apprentice numbers over a very short period has led to problems in fully addressing demand.</P>
    <P>I am taking steps to increase capacity further with the result that I expect training will be provided for an additional 1,300 apprentices in the next academic year. In addition, my Department is liaising with the institutes of technology to put in place the necessary arrangements to provide training for a minimum of 700 apprentices during the summer.</P>
    <P>Apprentice numbers are monitored on a regular basis by FÁS and training capacity is kept under continuing review by FÁS, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department in relation to their respective areas. There is also continuing close liaison between the Departments and training providers in relation to apprenticeship issues. In addition, the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee, which includes representatives of the social partners, advises the board of FÁS on apprenticeship issues.

      <P>The expert advisory group on certificate examinations has identified a set of principles as a basis for dealing with the complex and difficult area of special arrangements for examination candidates. My Department has begun the process of implementing the recommendations and applying the principles to applications on hand for this year's examinations.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations was that the time element of examinations should be made less critical in the future in order to better accommodate candidates who may have a difficulty with time. In response to this recommendation I have arranged for an extension of time to be made available to all candidates in a number of the more time critical papers in the forthcoming leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>At present extra time may be granted where the arrangement itself justifies the grant of additional time. For example extra time on that basis is granted where a candidate needs the help of a scribe. This recognises that the dictation process itself is slow. Usually ten minutes extra per hour of examination is allowed to cover the assistance of a scribe or an arrangement such as the use of braille materials. In a small number of cases the nature of the arrangement and the type of electronic or mechanical aids used by the candidate may require the grant of additional time over and above what is normally granted. My Department considers such cases individually on the basis of the evidence provided in support of the application.</P>
