      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 4, Finance Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 52, financial motions by the Minister for Finance, 1997, motion 9 (resumed); No. 49, financial motions by the Minister for Finance, 1998, motion 5 (resumed). Private Members' Business shall be No. 99, motion re pensioners and car testing (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Finance Bill, in view of the fact that the Taoiseach, together with the Tánaiste, and not the Minister for Finance, is meeting the Irish League of Credit Unions, will he be willing to accept questions on the matter and report to the Dáil at Question Time next week, given that the Minister for Finance cannot be asked to report on a meeting which he is not attending?</P>

      <P>That is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question on the Finance Bill because clearly it will require changes to that Bill.  If the Taoiseach is accepting responsibility for one part of the Finance Bill, I hope he will report to the House on that part of the Bill for which he is accepting responsibility in view of the shrinking violet characteristics of the Minister for Finance on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably not aware that a priority question is down today to the Minister for Finance on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister for Finance answer questions on an issue the Taoiseach has taken over from him? That question is irrelevant. Will the Taoiseach answer questions about the fact that he is having this meeting and will he alone be able to report to the House on his meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Administration has collec<Col N="3" /> tive responsibility in government; therefore, we talk to one another all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to know whether the Taoiseach will talk to the House about his meeting. We need to know from the Taoiseach what happens at this meeting. Clearly the Minister for Finance cannot report on it because he will not be there. Will the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that he will answer questions on his meeting in the Minister for Finance's current portfolio, but in the absence of the Minister for Finance, in regard to credit union taxation? It is an easy question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very easy question. I will inform the Minister for Finance of what took place at the meeting and he will inform the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not funny. It is not possible for someone who is absent from a meeting to report fully or to be accountable to the House for what happens at the meeting. The Taoiseach is accountable to the House and if he undertakes a meeting, only he can report back to the House on his actions, not the Minister for Finance. I again ask the Taoiseach will he be willing to answer questions to the House on this subject which he has taken from the Minister for Finance and is dealing with himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>If a question is put down, I am sure the normal arrangements will apply. If the normal arrangements in this case apply, the Minister for Finance will answer the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Order of Business and we are getting items refused, Sir, in relation to questions. Do I take it that what the Taoiseach has said is that he and the Tánaiste will meet representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, they will then convey the information to the Minister for Finance and if a parliamentary question is put down to the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste in respect of this specific meeting scheduled to take place tomorrow, it will inevitably be ruled out of order by you, Sir, on the grounds that it is pertinent for the Minister for Finance? This is abusing the Chair and implicating you, Sir, in attempting <Col N="4" /> to frustrate the efforts of the Opposition to do the job it was elected to do. I am asking the Taoiseach to stop the nonsense and give a direction to the Minister for Finance to meet these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Taoiseach speak about collective responsibility on the part of the Government. I listened yesterday to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands speak about burying the ideals of the previous Arts Council and the review of legislation. When is this new legislation likely to appear on the legislative programme for this year? In view of the reports in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> that the central core of the Broadcasting Bill, the presentation of Digico for the advent of digital television, is not to proceed, will there be a new Broadcasting Bill or is the Minister, who does not appear to know what is happening, likely to bring in a series of collective amendments?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday that the Minister had made some proposals about a new arts Bill. The Deputy should table a parliamentary question to the Minister about that matter. It is not on the current list of legislation. The Broadcasting Bill is before the select committee at present and there are not any other proposals at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Children Bill received its Second Reading in the House this week three years ago, although I do not expect any celebrations to mark the anniversary. Will the Taoiseach outline the position with regard to the other Children Bill which was introduced in September 1999? This Bill has been hanging around for 30 years. When will those necessary reforms be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first matter should be dealt with by way of a parliamentary question or as a matter on the Adjournment. I presume the Deputy is referring to the Children Bill, 1999. This will be debated in the House in a fortnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was dealing with the whole issue of individualisation and the claims which the Minister made for the measures he proposed on budget day and which he is implementing in the Finance Bill today and I dealt with the £3,000 tax free allowance.</P>
      <P>One of the primary reasons the Minister gave for the proposals he made was that it allowed him to take 83% of taxpayers out of the top rate of tax. The Minister knows this policy is not as relevant as it would have been a couple of years ago, for reasons which, on the face of it, sound technical but which are nonetheless important. In the first case the introduction of tax credits means, of necessity, that a higher percentage of taxpayers will pay tax at the higher rate of tax, since much of the tax which those people pay at the standard rate is actually refunded. For obvious reasons this point is lost on the general public who cannot be expected to follow such points of detail but the Minister understands it only too well. It is now the stated objective of Government and the social partners to take nearly 300,000 additional people out of the income tax net. There are already hundreds of thousands of income earners who do not pay tax at all and these people should be factored in when calculating the percentage of income earners who pay tax at the higher rate. Because they are factored out of the equation the overall picture given by the simple presentation of statistics which the Minister gives is misleading. My party and I believe that the higher rate of income tax kicks in at a level of income which is too low but structural changes in the tax system mean we have to have a fresh look at how we go about this. More importantly, we should be very wary of the distorted presentation of statistics which is intended to sell an unpopular measure which primarily benefits better off DINKIES. In his statement the Minister concludes with the interesting comment and observation that ultimately in a democratic society this boils down to electoral choice. This is a mantra which we have heard frequently from the Minister. He claims, with some justification, that he has a democratic mandate to reduce tax in the way he has done, namely, by reducing tax rates. How can he possibly claim he has a mandate for this measure and that it is a matter of democratic or electoral choice that he wants to individualise the standard rate band?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For goodness sake, there has not been any debate on this issue. The tax strategy group set up by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government in 1993 hardly debated it. So far as we can tell from the minutes of the meetings, it debated it at one meeting and it was dismissed as improbable and as something that was unlikely to get a significant basis of public support and the meeting moved <Col N="12" /> on to the next issue. All the indications are that this was a big idea which the Minister arrived at all by himself without going through even the normal process of Government. So far as we know, he bounced it off his ministerial colleagues on either budget day or the previous day. To suggest there is anything resembling an electoral mandate for it, if that is what the Minister intended to suggest yesterday, is clearly wrong. If he is suggesting he can get a mandate in retrospect for that sort of move his understanding of democracy is different from mine.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the comments of Commissioner Solbes in relation to the inflationary risks. This is pertinent in light of the new inflation figures published in the past week. I have been slow to push this button although I have been urged to do so on a number of occasions. The normal practice of the Opposition is to push that button whenever it is there to be pushed. I have been slow to do it largely because I accept much of the analysis which the Minister offers. I accept that much of our inflation is imported and is as a result of factors beyond our control. I have to agree with the Minister when I read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning his scepticism in relation to the advice he gets from international organisations. From contacts which I have had with individuals in the IMF or in the OECD I sometimes think there are economists on the top floors of some of these buildings who are only waiting to be proved right. To that extent I have some sympathy with where the Minister is coming from. There is no doubt but that the open nature of the Irish economy means that, to use the Minister's words, the normal rules of economics do not apply with the same force here. Having said that, there are distinct danger signals and we would be foolish not to pay some attention to them. It is unquestionably the case that asset price inflation is beyond control, at this stage. It is unquestionably the case that the price of services is spiralling to a worrying extent. We are now talking about 5% or 5.5% year on year increases in the price of services. That is worrying.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that domestic demand, the one part we can hope to control, is also increasing. This is clear from the credit figures and a whole range of indicators. The danger signs are there. Equally, and this may be most important from a political point of view, there is no doubt that in reducing tax by the measure and in the way he did, the Minister has sent a signal which is unhelpful and has injected into the economy money which unquestionably will stoke up domestic demand further and which can only lead to further inflation. Specifically by putting £500 million too much as spare cash, largely into the pockets of people who are better off, the Minister has stoked domestic demand unnecessarily and recklessly. That is something we may rue as the next year unfolds. I share some of the Minister's basic analysis but he is playing this game far too hard. He has done things recently which are reck<Col N="13" /> less and he needs to keep a close watch on this part of the game.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say a great deal at this stage about the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness since there will be statements on that issue tomorrow but I shall refer to two issues which leap off the pages in terms of the macro-economic argument. On taxation, it is now the stated objective of the social partners and of Government to take people on the minimum wage out of the income tax net. I do not know what this means. Are we being told explicitly that this will be done in the next two and three quarter years? Are we being told this is the sole tax policy of the Government over the next two and three quarter years or, as I suspect, that on the one hand some progress will be made, probably by way of tax credits on taking those on the minimum wage out of the tax net? The Minister will at the same time and at enormous expense look to pursue his own agenda which is to reduce the tax rates further. If the Minister seeks to reduce the tax rates, to take people on the minimum wage out of the income tax net, and at the same time seeks to pursue his individualisation project further, possibly to the end he outlined in the budget, he will be faced with an enormous reduction in income tax. He is certainly facing a reduction of far more than £1.5 billion over the next three budgets, assuming he is in office to introduce three more budgets. The Minister is facing a tax reduction of at least £2.5 billion. This is too much. Apart from the equity considerations of the way used to reduce tax, the economy cannot afford that sort of stimulus.</P>
    <P>How will the minimum wage relate to the wage increases which are part of the programme? This will have an impact on employment over the next few years. Will the national minimum wage become effective first, to be followed immediately by an increase of 5.5%, or can employers increase salaries up to the minimum wage level and claim that this also comprises the 5.5% increase? For low paid workers this is a significant question which could involve a large difference in the salary they take home. My party leader will take part tomorrow in the statements on the programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms the reductions in capital acquisitions tax which the Minister announced on budget day. The question of family homes presents a real problem with regard to CAT, whether they are owned by married couples, elderly siblings, gay couples or people who have been living in the same house for quite some time. Some time ago I indicated to the Minister that we would support his efforts to deal with that problem. By and large, the measures he proposes are worthy of support. However, I enter two caveats. First, there will be difficulty in policing this measure. I will be interested, on Committee Stage, to tease out the mechanisms for ensuring that people have been living in a house before the death of the person who makes the bequest and that they continue to live there for a period <Col N="14" /> of time thereafter. Second, I do not support the taking of family homes out of the tax net altogether. I would not have given a complete exemption. My party might have reduced the value of the house, for tax purposes, by 60% or 70%. I support the general thrust of this measure although I feel it is a little too generous.</P>
    <P>I do not support the remainder of the measures the Minister has taken. During the PAYE workers' marches and the great debates about tax reform in the late 1970s and early 1980s, tax reform was synonymous with broadening the tax base. We spoke of increasing capital taxes, property taxes, taxes on corporations and so on. Twenty years later the process has gone into reverse. I do not blame the Minister for this; previous Governments also played their part in the process. Nevertheless, the tax base has contracted dramatically in the past four or five years. Corporation tax is to be reduced to the basic minimum of 12.5%, the Minister has reduced the level of capital gains tax to 20% and he proposes to minimise the effectiveness of capital acquisitions tax. We have abolished service charges and residential property tax. We have no other property tax and no political prospect of introducing one. The only direct tax remaining is income tax. This causes us little difficulty at the moment because income tax and indirect taxes are giving high yields, but in future years we may regret that we have so precipitously reduced the tax base.</P>
    <P>The Minister will argue that by reducing the rate of capital gains tax he has increased the take. I do not accept that argument, but I will be fair and say that the jury is out on the matter. Because economic activity is at an unprecedented height, because people are transferring income into capital gains and because of one-off gains such as the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, one could claim that the take from CGT has increased. It is not clear that the reduction in the rate of CGT has stimulated activity or simply brought people into the net who were previously avoiding tax. One cannot argue that CAT &ndash; and certainly not inheritance tax &ndash; is demand led. By reducing the tax one does not encourage people to die or to leave bequests in a particular way. A son or daughter may inherit even a modest family home in Dublin which may be worth up to £350,000 and a further £300,000 without paying tax. Such a person may inherit unearned income of £600,000 without paying a penny in tax whereas someone who is earning £8,000 or £9,000 must pay 22p in the pound on every extra pound he or she earns. I cannot see the equity in that. Equity dictates that earned and unearned income should be taxed at the same rate and that is not happening.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were avoided in the budget and are not being dealt with now. The Minister has suggested that a measure will be introduced next week to address the issue of ESOPs and ESOTs. My party will support share option schemes provided they are intended as a means of encouraging participation and are widely available to all employees in a particular place of <Col N="15" /> employment. We will not support measures which are intended to allow employers to select favourite employees &ndash; perhaps high fliers in the IT sector &ndash; and give them share options as a means of retaining them. If employers wish to give favoured employees particularly favourable terms of employment, that is their entitlement and most have sufficiently deep pockets to do so. If employers wish to effect a broad structural change within their companies and encourage all or most employees to participate financially and to have a stake in the company, we will support measures to facilitate that. In the past, in this jurisdiction and in the UK, share option schemes have been abused as a means of tax avoidance. That is something against which we must guard. However, in our current economic circumstances we can afford to take some risks in this area and we would broadly support the Minister in doing that.</P>
    <P>If we have learned nothing else from the political events of last December, we must surely have learned that we must look again at our way of introducing budgets. The Estimates process, in particular, is nonsensical. It is absurd that Ministers and accounting officers are accountable to the House only when all the money, or most of it, has been spent. We should move to the system used by almost every other parliament in Europe where the projects and plans of each Department are accounted for in advance. Departments should come to committees of Dáil Éireann to ask for money to spend on various projects so that when ministerial or governmental decisions are made they can be read in that light. Our tradition of secrecy is one we have borrowed from the British. It may have served us well 20, 30 or 40 years ago but it no longer does so. The only justification for budgetary secrecy relates to excise duty or major tax changes. Ironically, the only change in excise duty in this year's budget &ndash; the 50p increase on cigarettes &ndash; was signalled well in advance so that people who wished to hoard cigarettes could have done so. I am not aware of evidence of much hoarding. In so far as one could have justified secrecy, that was the one issue on which it could have been justified but the Minister chose to fly the kite in advance. Clearly a major proposal such as individualisation should not have been sprung on the Cabinet, the Dáil, the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party or an unsuspecting public. There should have been genuine debate in advance. The Minister had nothing to fear from such a debate. It would have been good for the House and the Government to be able to argue the merits of the Minister's case in advance of its introduction.</P>
    <P>On the budgetary process I put down a marker in relation to multi-annual budgeting which has become a perennial issue raised at the end of budget speeches, but there is no doubt that it has run into the sand at this stage. Two years ago the Government undertook to introduce disaggregated Estimates for particular Departments, but <Col N="16" /> this was postponed in light of the talks on a successor to Partnership 2000. I wager that we will not witness it as long as the Government is in power. Is the Minister still committed to multi-annual budgeting and, if so, when will it commence? It is an important part of the reform of Civil Service management and, if used properly, will add to the transparency and accountability of the budgetary process which is badly needed.</P>
    <P>I started my contribution yesterday evening by making some personal comments about the Minister. In a sense they were justified principally because it was very much his budget. Many of the central tenets, particularly those which got him into trouble, were his. He holds responsibility. I look forward to debating these matters in greater detail on Committee Stage next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to raise a number of important issues that may assist the debate on taxation matters in this House. It is particularly appropriate at a time when we are putting in place a further national partnership programme that the Bill gives effect to the largest budget tax package we have seen. All will agree that social partnership has contributed substantively to economic and social development. The latest agreement is the fifth since 1987. Their operation has been central to the economic stability which enabled the economy to grow more than twice as fast as the EU norm since 1987, to deliver six times the EU rate of employment growth and to raise living standards twice as fast as the EU average.</P>
      <P>The programme is dependent upon achieving an average annual GNP growth rate of just under 6% over the period to 2002. This is in the expectation that there will be ongoing improvements in productivity, that emerging supply side constraints will be overcome and that significant budgetary surpluses will be maintained throughout the period. If economic growth exceeds assumptions, it may be possible to apply additional resources to accelerate progress towards the priority objectives of the programme, including social inclusion. Equally, if growth falls below this level it may be necessary to make more gradual progress.</P>
      <P>The partnership concept represents an exercise in social governance. The parameters of the policies agreed in the partnership indicate the way ahead to secure further prosperity and a fair sharing of resources. It is important that the House should debate the policies and involve itself in how the agreement is rolled out. Representation of the people and governance is after all a key role of the Oireachtas and its elected Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition and levying of taxation is the <Col N="17" /> prerogative of the House. That is the reason we have the Money Bill mechanism to ensure legislative decisions on such matters can only be taken in this Chamber. It is only right, therefore, that the House should take particular interest in the taxation initiatives in the programme and I note from the questions tabled to the Minister today that Members opposite will be looking carefully at how those initiatives are developed.</P>

The Government's record in delivering on what it put before the electorate has been good. The recently agreed programme review between the Government parties envisages further active tax reform. Clearly the Government is committed to radical tax change. We have introduced tax credits and acted to remove substantial numbers from the tax net. We have pursued a policy of increasing allowances, widening bands and cutting tax rates. These measures have been welcomed by taxpayers and contributed to increasing prosperity and the fair distribution of resources.</P>
      <P>Under the Government, more than 175,000 taxpayers have been removed from the tax net since 1997. In the previous three years the figure was 38,000. Yet, the message that some have put abroad is that the Government cares less for the lower paid than our predecessor. As I said last week, we should debate issues on the basis of facts, and the facts are clear when it comes to actual performance in taking the low-paid out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>I agree with the programme when it concludes that confidence in the fairness of the tax system is a prerequisite for successful partnership and that this must be maintained by determined action to combat tax evasion and fraud and to reduce opportunities for tax avoidance. The Government is fully aware of the need to maintain confidence in the effectiveness of the tax system and the major and extensive new powers given to the Revenue Commissioners in last year's Finance Act provide a sound basis for tackling those who seek to evade their tax responsibilities. The inclusion of powers in last year's Act was timely given all that has transpired in this area in the past 12 months. It is fair to acknowledge the work of the Committee of Public Accounts in bringing the issues to public attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with some of the more important and relevant aspects of the Bill. The personal tax changes set out in sections 2 to 12, inclusive, continue the progress already made by the Government to implement the commitments on personal taxation which we set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium and which <Col N="18" /> were reconfirmed in our review of the programme last November. The Government's stated objective is to reduce the burden of taxation to reward effort, to incentivise the take-up of work and to remove more of the low paid from the tax net.</P>
    <P>The personal taxation package of £1 billion which the Minister for Finance announced on 1 December and which will be implemented by the Bill is the largest ever. It will benefit all taxpayers through increases in personal allowances, the 2% reductions in the higher and standard rates of tax, the broadening of the standard rate band for single and two earner couples and a range of other measures, including the increase in the elderly exemption limits and the doubling and standard rating of the allowances for widows, blind persons and others.</P>
    <P>We are embarking on a major and ambitious programme of tax reform in the area of personal taxation, the two central pillars of which are the move to a system of tax credits announced in last year's budget and the creation of a single standard rate band for individual taxpayers. The Bill continues the first of these reforms with the standard rating of the remaining personal allowances. It also initiates the move to individualisation of the tax bands. These far-reaching reforms will radically alter the structure of the taxation system so that it is more equitable, efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>The changes we are presenting in the Bill will remove 73,000 taxpayers, including 10,000 elderly persons, from the tax net and increase the income at which a single PAYE worker enters the tax net from £100 to £110 per week. The budget taxation measures will be complemented by additional measures for the low-paid in the Social Welfare Bill. I am pleased our vision for reforming the tax structure has been endorsed by the social partners in the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We are all agreed that our taxation system will be further developed to deliver tax reductions in a fair, targeted and equitable way.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill introduces a new £3,000 home carer's allowance for married spouses caring for certain people in the home. When deciding the parameters for this relief much thought was given to whom this allowance should apply and consequently it recognises the responsibilities of married spouses who work mainly in the home caring for children, the aged and the incapacitated as well as those who care for elderly or incapacitated relatives who do not live with the carer but within a reasonably close distance. The new allowance complements the Government's other personal tax changes. The allowance provides for an income disregard and its tapered withdrawal so that any spouse returning to work with significant income will retain it for a certain period. This will ensure the relief will not be lost when the circumstances of the family change. The home carer's allowance and the increased standard band for certain two earner couples are mutually exclusive but taxpayers will be entitled to which<Col N="19" /> ever is more beneficial to them in the particular tax year.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for tax relief for post-graduate fees under certain conditions for post-graduate courses in Ireland and other EU member states and includes distance education courses offered by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. Since the commencement of free fees in 1995 for undergraduate students at publicly funded colleges, the Government has introduced tax relief for full-time courses at private colleges and part-time courses at publicly funded and private colleges. Last year tax relief was provided for full-time undergraduate students in publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. The introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees builds on the Government's clear commitment to enhancing Ireland's reputation for having a highly educated and skilled workforce. The relief will also encourage people to take up further education which, while benefiting the individuals concerned, will also benefit society as a whole.</P>
    <P>The tax relief for certain expenditure on significant buildings and gardens is a generous one. Section 42 will change the opening days needed to qualify for the relief. Individuals claiming the relief must now open for ten weekend days during the period 1 May to 30 September. This will benefit people who want to visit these properties by improving the consistency and convenience of the opening hours for the public by increasing weekend access to such properties over the summer months while considering the needs of owners by not making the weekend opening requirement too burdensome.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation recognises the importance of fundraising for third level institutions and section 43 extends and develops the tax relief available for such donations. A broader base for fundraising initiatives should be encouraged by reducing the <i>de minimis</i> for tax relieved donations from £1,000 to £250, and the legislation allows the Minister for Education and Science, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to increase the areas of expenditure beyond the four areas as set out currently in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 44 proposes two changes to the tax relief for &ldquo;save as you earn&rdquo; share option schemes. The first change allows the use of a trust to purchase existing shares for a &ldquo;save as you earn&rdquo; scheme. The current legislation only allows the use of new shares. The second change reduces the age of retirement from 66 years of age to any age between 60 and 66. These two changes should improve the attractiveness of &ldquo;save as you earn&rdquo; schemes and the Government is watching the take-up and success of these and other profit and employee share schemes with interest.</P>
    <P>The tax relief for donations of heritage items to national heritage institutions has proved its worth since its introduction in 1995. The increase in the limit from £750,000 to £3 million in section 137 is a reflection of the number of major heritage items <Col N="20" /> made available in this way since the relief was introduced. These donations include a collection of five modern Irish paintings by Jack B. Yates, William John Leech and James Humbert Craig valued at £125,000 and an Italian marble sculpture, &ldquo;Amorino&rdquo;, by Antonio Canova, valued at £520,000.</P>
    <P>Sections 33 to 40 deal with changes to the relief for the Custom House docks area, the urban and rural renewal schemes, enterprise areas and certain offshore islands. Many of the amendments have been made necessary to comply with the European Commission's conditional approval of a number of tax reliefs over the past year.</P>
    <P>Section 72 will provide for tax relief in respect of certain towns with populations between 500 and 6,000. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will announce the areas which are to be designated under the new scheme in the near future. The relief provided for under the scheme will be similar to the relief already available under urban relief. The residential elements of the scheme will commence from 1 April 2000. The business tax reliefs must be notified to, and approved by, the European Commission before they can be introduced. The scheme is intended to aid the restoration of the centres of small towns by restoring or improving the built fabric and by promoting sensitive local development. In common with many large urban areas, the centres of some smaller towns have experienced dramatic declines in population and increases in dereliction as more people choose to live on the edge of these towns or in open countryside. This scheme will help to arrest this decline and to increase the housing stock in a cost-effective way by encouraging the renovation of existing accommodation in the centre of towns.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced in the budget that he had decided to abolish the £5 excise duty levied on tickets issued for travel overseas. This tax was first imposed with effect from 1 September 1982. Because of the growing increase in travel overseas, the annual yield from this tax has risen steadily over time to approximately £19 million in 1999. However, with the improvement in Government revenues and in recognition of the abolition of duty free sales for intra-Community travel, the budget afforded an opportune time to abolish this tax. This is a positive measure in support of the business and tourism sectors and will be of considerable benefit to air and sea transport operators and, in particular, to regional airports. The move has been welcomed by the travel trade.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that smoking rates in Ireland are on the increase. The recent SLAN lifestyle survey points to an overall rise in smoking among the population and, in particular, among young women. Tobacco consumption is the single most preventable cause of early mortality in the State. Half of all smokers eventually die from smoking-related disease and half of these will die prematurely in middle age. It is estimated that around 7,000 deaths each year in Ireland are attributable to smoking. An inordi<Col N="21" /> nate number of hospital admissions each year are due to smoking-related conditions, including cancers, heart and circulatory system diseases and respiratory conditions such as emphysema. It is hoped that the highest single excise tax increase ever imposed at budget time of 50p on a packet of 20 cigarettes &ndash; I, as a heavy smoker, smile inwardly &ndash; will act as a deterrent and will reduce projected cigarette consumption below what it would otherwise have been, particularly among young smokers who may be more price sensitive than other persons.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces some of the most significant reforms of the capital acquisitions tax code since that tax replaced estate duties and death duties almost a quarter of a century ago. On the interaction of this taxation with housing, Deputies on all sides will be well aware from their constituency work that for many people taxation on the inheritance of the home, in which they may have lived for many years, had become a serious issue. Frequently the people faced with the demand from the Revenue Commissioners could not be described as wealthy by any standard. This problem first manifested itself in the greater Dublin area but it had become an issue throughout the country due to the recent sharp and sustained increase in house prices. The inflation in house prices had greatly exceeded the indexation arrangements in the CAT system which is linked to the general consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Section 130 resolves the problem of taxation on the inheritance of a person's dwelling once and for all. The new family home relief removes the tax, where the person inherits or has been gifted the home provided that person has been living in the residence for the three years prior to the inheritance or gift. However, it does so in a way which is sensitive to the many different types of relationships which are to be found in contemporary Ireland as well as relationships that take a more traditional form.</P>
    <P>While the family home relief will include conditions requiring the beneficiary of the relief not to dispose of the dwelling for six years and to reside in it for the same period, a number of exceptions from this general rule are contemplated by the Bill. In particular, I would draw the attention of the House to the special arrangements being made for people aged 55 or over who will not be subject to the post-transfer ownership and residence requirement. Similar exceptions are being made for those who are in need of long-term medical care.</P>
    <P>The family home relief is a suitably prompt and compassionate response to an issue which was causing anxiety for many. The aftermath of a bereavement is sufficiently distressing without the added worry of whether one is to be forced out of one's home simply because escalating house prices meant that a tax bill could not be met. The relief also takes account of a reality of modern day life, that not all committed relationships are based on marriage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> I welcome the provision that will ensure that the names of tax defaulters will be published in cases where proceedings may have been initiated by Revenue, and whether any fine or penalty is imposed by the courts. This provision will also confirm that publication will take place in settlement cases where the full tax, interest and penalties have been paid, and it will permit that the details to be published may include a brief summary of the nature and circumstances of the default. In view of public concern over recent high profile cases of tax evasion, I see this as a timely measure which will copperfasten the public's right to information about the progress made by Revenue in pursuing tax evaders.</P>
    <P>The latest inflation figures released this week by the Central Statistics Office show headline inflation for January to be 4%. On a HICP basis, inflation was 3.9% in December compared with an EU average of 1.7%. I listened with great care to what Deputy McDowell said in his analysis, which I thought was reasonably fair.</P>
    <P>As this House is aware, the economy is extremely open and, as such, international inflation and exchange rate movements play a significant role in determining our inflation rate. It is more significant than in most economies. It is fair to say also that there is much misunderstanding about this point. Domestic pressures are leading to higher prices in some sectors but the most important reasons for the increase in inflation are external and outside our control.</P>
    <P>The euro has been extremely weak since its launch and has fallen by about 15% against the dollar. In addition, crude oil prices have gone from $11 per barrel last spring to about $28 at present. Combining these two factors, crude oil prices have increased by close to 180% in Irish pound terms. This has fed through into higher petrol and home heating oil prices and, in total, has added more than 1% to headline inflation.</P>
    <P>This increase in inflation will be temporary. The impact of euro weakness and higher oil prices will be reduced over the course of the year and inflation will start to fall steadily. However, there would be consequences for our future economic prospects if this temporary increase in prices started adding to wage inflation. This is the crucial issue for this Government and for the social partners. We must avoid this and ensure wage increases remain competitive.</P>
    <P>Towards this end, the Government has just completed negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000. This will continue the consensus based approach to managing our economic affairs. The pay terms of the new agreement are fair and reasonable. They strike a balance between providing gains in real disposable incomes while maintaining the economy's competitiveness. Adherence to these pay terms is essential if we are to sustain economic and social progress. The Government's tax policy is an integral part of this. Reducing taxes is vital to secure moderate wage increases and low inflation. Commentators who criticise this policy stance need to put for<Col N="23" /> ward a viable alternative to policies which have been successful for the past 13 years.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill will underpin the recent progress of our economy and prepare the ground for greater growth in living standards. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important Finance Bill which is among the most progressive legislation ever brought before this House. The Finance Bill, 2000, has to be seen in the context of budget 2000, to which it gives legislative effect, the Social Welfare Bill and the recently negotiated Programme for Fairness and Prosperity.</P>
      <P>Arising from these measures, particularly the Bill we are discussing, there will be just rewards for the public. The Minister of State spoke about the largest tax package in the history of the State to which this Bill gives effect. Coupled with the Fianna Fáil Party's commitment before the 1997 general election to introduce substantial personal taxation relief packages, it is heartening to note that this Bill provides for more than £1 billion in personal tax reductions along with the £1 billion already delivered in the Government's previous two budgets.</P>
      <P>Some 70,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net, including 10,000 over 65 year olds. This Bill and the budgetary measures takes 125,000 taxpayers off the top rate by substantially widening the standard rate tax band. The standard and top rates of tax have each been cut by 2%. The doubling of personal allowances for the aged, the widowed, dependent relatives and incapacitated children are all very welcome measures.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell rightly spoke about the burden of capital acquisitions tax, particularly in regard to family homes. The Government has adopted the right measures in exempting the shared family home from capital acquisitions tax and also cutting the capital acquisitions tax rates to 20%. These are all very necessary measures which take account of today's prices.</P>
      <P>Great credit is due to the Government and the social partners on negotiating a very fair Programme for Fairness and Prosperity. Most of us who represent the less well-off in society, and who have a particular interest in advancing the needs of the less well-off and lower income groups, are tired of right-wing economists having constant access to the airwaves propagating their right-wing views that the working class does not deserve a pay rise.</P>
      <P>The pay proposals in the newly negotiated Programme for Fairness and Prosperity are justified. The tax reliefs are justified for those on the lower income scale who have not benefited to the same extent from the strong economy as have the better-off in society. All of us who have an interest in ensuring that the country's wealth is shared will reject many of the views put forward by these right-wing economists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These same people bemoan the Government's <Col N="24" /> lack of investment in infrastructure. They talk constantly about gridlock, the lack of infrastructure throughout the country, whether with regard to water, sewerage or telecommunications, while at the same time, they propagate the view that Government expenditure should be reduced. One cannot provide infrastructure and housing and improve the traffic situation unless there is investment.</P>
    <P>The Government has rightly provided a huge investment programme through the national development plan. Some £41 billion will be invested over the next six years in building up the country's infrastructure, in providing housing and water, sewerage and roads services to bring them up to a standard so that we can ensure the economy and employment opportunities grow and that future employment opportunities will be provided for people who want to work in this country.</P>
    <P>Coming from a Border region, I was particularly glad the Government had the courage and the political vision to regionalise the country. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are the only two political parties which wholeheartedly supported regionalisation which gave us Objective One status. The Objective One designation for the Border, midlands and western regions will be beneficial to all those areas.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the areas concerned. Deputy Durkan's constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, was foremost in his commitment to ensuring that the less developed areas got the necessary infrastructure development to enable them to obtain employment opportunities and bring inward investment to those areas. It is unfortunate that Fine Gael, a party which is represented in most constituencies, did not have the courage to come down in favour of and support the development of the less well off areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister of State speak about the extension of tax relief at the standard rate for post-graduate fees under certain conditions. He stated the relief can be claimed by the person concerned or by his or her parents, guardians or spouse where they pay the fees. This is a welcome measure because we all know of students who have gone through college and who need to do post-graduate research to enable them to acquire skills and to involve themselves in research and development which is very important for the further development of our economy.</P>
      <P>I would like the Government to improve higher education grants. The income limits are too restrictive and the maintenance grants have decreased in real value because of the increase in the cost of accommodation, particularly in centres where universities and institutes of technology are sited. It would be welcome if the Government could improve substantially the income levels to qualify for higher education grants and the maintenance element of those grants. There are particular problems in the Border areas because many students from those areas study in the North of Ireland, England or Scotland and given the current punt-sterling differential, the grant payment here is substantially devalued when converted to sterling. A general improvement in the level of such grants would enable many more students to partake in third level education.</P>
      <P>Under the Finance Bill the Minister has extended the urban and rural renewal schemes until 31 December 2002. Two years ago the Minister for Finance introduced the rural renewal scheme, which is applicable to west Cavan, Leitrim, Longford and parts of Sligo and Roscommon. That scheme is most beneficial. It arose from a commitment in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto prior to the 1997 election when the party stated it would give focus to a pilot scheme for an area that had suffered through depopulation and lack of development. I am pleased the qualifying date under that scheme will be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the measures in the Social Welfare Bill, which run parallel to those in the Finance Bill. The measures in the Social Welfare Bill will <Col N="26" /> provide for the less well off and introduce many innovative and welcome changes to the social welfare system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I was one of ten members of the Fine Gael Party who went to Brussels at the invitation of Joe McCartin, MEP, to make the case for the areas that qualified for Objective One status. When we went there we discovered the Government had done almost nothing to further that cause. I was pleased to be part of that deputation, which included Deputies who represent constituencies that are directly involved. We then witnessed the shambles left by the Government when Independent TDs tried to include counties that did not qualify for that status. I record my position and that of my colleagues on this matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the rural renewal scheme, I compliment the former Minister, Deputy Kenny, who pioneered the seaside resort tax incentive scheme for the Government to follow it through under the rural renewal tax incentive scheme. A good deal of investment is being made in the counties involved in the scheme, including my county of Longford. That tax incentive scheme has done a good deal to attract investment and encourage people to return to areas that were denied opportunities in the past.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has signed contracts with farmers under REPS, but it has failed to honour them. Some farmers who qualified under the REPS are waiting for 12 months for their payment. I would like the Minister to tell the House what the Government will do about honouring its contracts. Will it pay interest on the payments due? The Government has failed miserably to provide the necessary funding to employ inspectors in the Department and that is why the Government has failed to honour its contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Defence &ndash; this is an area in which the Acting Chairman is also interested &ndash; it has emerged that the Department of Finance is planning to cut the Defence Forces personnel by 2,000. The Minister for Finance should forget about doing that. We should stand by the Army that has stood by this country since the foundation of the State. The Army has given an excellent service and when various crises have arisen it has come to the rescue. We are proud of Connolly Barracks in Longford and of the Army presence there. The Minister should leave the Army alone. The Civil Service may have ideas about cutbacks and it is there to advise Ministers where to cut back. Elected representatives, and that includes the Fianna Fáil and PD Ministers, are there to represent the people and the people are saying, &ldquo;Hands off the Army, leave the Army <Col N="27" /> alone.&rdquo;  The Government should provide the necessary funding to ensure the Defence Forces have the resources to continue the work of the Navy, which is vital in terms of coastal inspections to detect drug trafficking and the protection of our fisheries, but all that is being neglected by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister should provide funding for the carer's allowance. Under the current scheme, if a social welfare recipient qualifies for the carer's allowance, that allowance is immediately taken into consideration because he or she is in receipt of social welfare benefit. That is not a level playing pitch. People who qualify for the carer's allowance who are social welfare recipients should be treated the same as carers who are non-social welfare recipients, but they are not. I hope the Minister will address that anomaly immediately.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the house improvement grant has not been restored. It was an exceptionally good grant that was made available from 1983 to 1987. The first act of the then Fianna Fáil Government when it returned to office in 1987 was to discontinue that grant. I ask the Government, as I asked the previous Government, to restore the house improvement grant. Many houses throughout the length and breadth of the country could be restored if the necessary incentive was provided. That could be done by restoring the house improvement grant. It is vital to finance the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to enable it to employ more inspectors to complete the REP inspection. The Government has failed to honour its contract. It should now have to pay interest on top of the REP payment.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Department of Defence, the Minister for Finance should forget about cutting back the Army and provide funds for it. The military authorities &ndash; the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps &ndash; have told the Minister for Defence where they stand, and they are the professionals. There must be no barrack closures. That is important to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the context of Mullingar. It is important also in the case of Connolly Barracks to provide the funding and keep the barracks open. The opportunity of a good healthy life in the Army should be there for our young people. That is what this country needs. I am afraid this Government is failing on that front.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute on the Finance Bill. This Government was lucky to achieve power when it did and to find itself in a position in its first two budgets to be able to give tax reductions of £1 billion and, in the budget this year, to give tax reductions of another £1 billion. This Government has been quick to blame the last Government for shortcomings, but perhaps it is time to give credit to previous Governments for the current state of the country's finances. When a Government gives away such a large amount of <Col N="28" /> money it should make everybody happy. However, the Minister for Finance made many people very unhappy and had to make quite an embarrassing U-turn within two weeks of budget day. It is quite worrying when a Minister gets things so wrong that he is forced, within such a short time, to make a U-turn that adds another half a billion pounds to the cost of the budget.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy McDowell, that our approach to budgets is archaic. We should have a debate on taxation to prepare people for the budget and highlight any drawbacks, although, for obvious reasons, not everything can be covered.</P>
      <P>It is worrying that only the Minister for Finance and a very small number of people were privy to the proposal on individualisation for tax purposes. It was not mentioned in any election manifesto, so the Government did not have a mandate for it. The Minister made a mess of bringing in individualisation. He wanted to achieve fairness. He also wanted to encourage or possibly force people, mainly women, into the workforce. Because individualisation was so unfair and inequitable, the Minister then had to grant a £3,000 allowance to carers at home. Now he has created a number of different types of family under the tax regime, and this problem will be exacerbated in the years ahead because of individualisation and how it was handled by the Minister.</P>
      <P>This &ldquo;make it up as you go along&rdquo; budget gives cause for serious concern and added to that is the stance the Minister has taken in relation to the credit union debacle, another situation where we have to question the Minister's judgment. First, we had the debacle regarding individualisation. Now we have what I can only describe as a scandal with regard to the credit unions. For two years the Minister has refused to meet a group which represents over one million people, and the Taoiseach has to trot off and meet with it instead. It is the job of the Minister for Finance to meet it but he said recently there is nothing new he can learn by doing so. That is not the point. It may have something to learn by meeting him. It's requesting a meeting with the Minister and he is refusing it. That is wrong. Is the Exchequer going to lose out in the long run because of the Minister's refusal to meet with the credit unions? </P>
      <P>There are even more serious issues around this. The credit unions want a fair and equitable system of taxation. The reason we have DIRT in the first place is that people, being human beings, may be slow to declare all their interest. In the past many people assumed they did not have to declare interest on savings. Now the credit unions want to pay DIRT and the Minister is refusing even to discuss the matter. This is crazy. I cannot understand it. It makes no sense whatsoever. In the final analysis not only are the credit unions losing but taxpayers also. I appeal to the Government to sort it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also quite worried about inflation. I will not say too much about it other than to note that <Col N="29" /> the gap between Ireland and the EU in relation to inflation has tripled in the past six months. We have had a number of budgets, all of which have been inflationary. That is worrying. Many of the points being made are coming from outside this House. The increase in cigarette duty and costs has been partly to blame. I agree with that increase and hope it will serve to curb smoking among younger people. I, with Deputy Shatter, am in the process of publishing a Bill on this issue because action has to be taken on it. I am also concerned that increases in the price of petrol, motor oil and heating oil are having a serious effect not only on inflation but also on business competitiveness. The Minister missed an opportunity to reduce duty on fuels to compensate business and motorists who are paying a lot towards the Exchequer at the moment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the relief being given in respect of post-graduate courses, but it does not go far enough. Perhaps fees should be covered to a greater extent. Income limits in respect of undergraduate courses are also too low. I call on the Government to look at these again. I am glad the Minister of State involved in education is in the House. I am sure most people would agree that students are under pressure at the moment. If we are to be competitive as an economy we have to ensure that people are encouraged to stay on in education, and any impediment must be removed. Some people do not qualify for a grant because their income is £100, £200 or £300 over the limit. At those levels it causes huge strain and means that some people cannot afford stay on at third level. The Minister of State should make a special effort to get this addressed. The amount of the grant and the income limits should be increased. Many older workers need retraining, and it would be useful if tax relief could be given on the cost of retraining should somebody decide to do a course with this in mind.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking to some accountants who agree that the Bill is very complex and that the changes to it and the fact that they were made so late could give rise to loopholes. If a self-employed person earning £35,000 per year decides to employ his or her spouse and pays him or her £6,000 or £7,000, it will change the overall taxation situation. There have been some publications about this recently. I do not know if that was intended, but perhaps the Minister will examine the matter and come back to the House on it.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled that the Minister for Defence tells us he has to cut back on the Army because he does not have the money. That does not make sense at a time when the problem this lucky Minister for Finance has is that he has too much money. Last year there were differences of opinion between the National Treasury Management Agency and the Department of Finance as to what the surplus would be, and the Department got it wrong because it was far greater than it had anticipated. The Minister for Defence is now saying that he must cut back on the Defence Forces and the <Col N="30" /> reason he gives is that he does not have sufficient resources, but that does not hold water. The Minister must re-examine that matter and come up with a better argument.</P>
    <P>House prices are a major worry and we also have a problem with industrial relations. These matters are linked. According to the reply to a parliamentary question I received yesterday, the number of man days lost in the first three quarters of 1999 equalled the 1998 total. The 1999 figure of 37,000 man days lost does not include the nurses' strike or other disputes that occurred in the final quarter of last year. While there are many good measures in the budget and the Finance Bill, we have reservations about some aspects which need to be teased out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, has left the House. He obviously has a memory problem and would not qualify for a &ldquo;beat the memory man&rdquo; team. In his speech he referred to the great work done in the past 13 years, implying that the great work started in 1987. The work that had to begin in 1981 was to repair the damage done in 1977. I would remind the House of the circumstances that prevailed at that time when, following the effects of an oil crisis and following good Government and management of the economy, the incoming Government decided that the fire was not burning brightly enough, so more petrol was poured on it. The effect lasted for precisely two years, at which point the whole thing collapsed. Inflation and interest rates went wild and the Government virtually abdicated because it no longer had the nerve to face the responsibilities it had taken upon itself. It has become known as the greatest fiasco in recent history. Obviously, the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, does not remember it but I do, very clearly. I can remember the daily news headlines at the time and I hope we are not facing a similar situation now.</P>
      <P>Over the past six months, particularly as we approached budget day, there was a daily mantra from the newspapers that represent the Government side of the House. Those newspapers regularly attempted to identify the full extent of the money the Government had to spend. Was it £1 billion, £2 billion or in excess of that? Public expectation was hyped up in an extremely dangerous way and the result is that not only did the Government create the expectation but it failed to identify it fully. In the budget the Government decided to throw money in certain directions but left a number of people out, and it paid the price for that very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never in the history of the State has a Minister for Finance had to come back three or four times with a revised budget. The Government brought this upon itself. It is most extraordinary that a pilgrimage to the plinth of Leinster House can result in a change of budget. It paid off, however, because most of the people who visited the plinth at that time were subsequently promoted. I would suggest that a visit to the plinth is not a bad idea <Col N="31" /> for those on that side of the House who are seeking promotion in future.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that this country has had, for several years going back to the mid-1980s, higher growth rates than any other European Union member state. I am not so sure, however, it is such a good indicator that we now have the highest inflation rate in the EU. In those circumstances I am concerned that we might be on the run into something we experienced before. I have no doubt that the Government is fully conversant with the consequences of that type of situation and I hope it will not just hang in until the next general election in the hope that it might obtain an overall majority. I can tell it that it will not achieve that &ndash; perish the thought. It will not happen. I have a deep suspicion, however, that that is in the back of the Government's mind and that two months after regaining office with this so-called overall majority it will then be in a position to tell the electorate: &ldquo;Sorry folks, we got it slightly wrong, you are going to have to take a cut-back now&rdquo;. I am predicting that is the Government's thinking, but it will have to face a very angry electorate if that comes about. There should be no doubt in anybody's mind about that and the public will not be duped in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's speech contained the usual stories that are trotted out at Finance Bill time. I am not sure whether the same people actually produce the speeches, but there is a common thread running though them. Every year at budget time somebody gives a huge tax relief to the poorer people. Earlier in his speech, the Minister of State said: &ldquo;The changes we are presenting in the Bill will remove 73,000 taxpayers, including 10,000 elderly persons, from the tax net and increase the income at which a single PAYE worker enters the tax net from £100 to £110 per week.&rdquo;  That represents a whole £10 a week. If one calculates it carefully, however, what usually happens is that people on the fringes will be taken out of the taxation net, but it does not quantify the benefit to those concerned because in most cases it is minimal. The same story has been trotted out for every budget and every Finance Bill, certainly since I became a Member of the House. I am sure it also happened long before I came here and I have no doubt that it will continue long after I have left. I am not trying to disillusion anybody but that is the way it is.</P>
    <P>Various excuses have been put forward concerning the causes of inflation, such as the increase in the price of cigarettes or the plummeting value of the euro. Sterling is strong and oil prices have the same impact in the UK as they do here, yet oil prices are about 15% higher in the UK. What is the explanation for that difference?</P>
    <P>One of the points that has not been referred to in the Minister of State's speech and is not taken into account in the consumer price index is the increase in house prices. In certain parts of the country house prices have doubled in the past <Col N="32" /> three years. If somebody can tell me how that can happen without some impact on wage demands and, ultimately, on inflation, I would be extremely surprised. People are now making wage demands that compensate for inflation, but if inflation is on the way up, how can one anticipate the extent of future wage claims? The Minister for Finance says inflation will level off in the middle of the year, but will house prices level off then? Will people seeking mortgages in the middle of this year be able to say they can now borrow £10,000 or £20,000 less to buy a house? Nothing like that will happen. Nothing has been done to address the problem of housing demand and all that goes with it. Unless and until something is done, people will not be able to accurately predict what will happen in the economy in future.</P>
    <P>A matter that affects my constituency &ndash; and particularly my former constituency &ndash; is the revisionism relating to the Defence Forces. I do not accept the theory now generally applied that all is well in the land and that we do not really need an army any more. It is ironic that the Naval Service is the most under-financed and under-supplied navy of its size in Europe. We have more miles of coast than any other country in Europe apart from our near neighbours, and we are supposed to be combating a drugs problem which will require a higher degree of surveillance from the Air Corps and the Naval Service. However, the only thing that has happened is that the Government has decided to close the Army down. Attempts are being made daily to say that anything proposed in that area must be self-financing, while at the same time the Government has virtually told the public for months that it has so many billions of pounds available that it does not know what to do with it. It is an extraordinary situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a large Bill and shows the work the Minister for Finance is doing to update the taxation system since coming to office. Before dealing with it I will refer to some of the comments of previous speakers. I must comment on the Army and the Naval Service, given the latter is based in Cobh, which is in my own back yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression given by some people is that the Naval Service is from the last century, but that does not stand up. Many new ships have been purchased in recent years and equipment on the ships has been updated to bring them into the modern age of computerisation. A new ship was brought to Ireland last month which was built abroad, but the supervision of its construction and any changes made to the original plan were due to the engineers and officers &ndash; up to the <Col N="33" /> rank of captain &ndash; in the naval dockyard. They supervised the project and brought it in under cost. We owe a great debt of gratitude to those members of the Naval Service who are willing to use their expertise for the good of the country and the Naval Service now has a fine ship available to patrol the coast. One of the other Naval Service ships is getting refitted in what is called a half life job.</P>
    <P>The problem of the Naval Service is getting people to join it, which is also a problem for the Army. Speakers have said the Minister for Finance is trying to cut Army numbers to 8,500 members. I do not know where this figure is coming from; I believe it is being plucked out of the air. The Minister for Defence is not talking about reducing the Army to 8,500, and listening to him this morning the Army will have 10,500 to 11,000 members. Many of these scare stories are simply that &ndash; stories.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan mentioned the national debt. The national debt went from zero to approximately £9 billion from 1973 to 1977. From 1977 to 1981 it went from £9 billion to approximately £12 billion, the period in which everyone says the country was run into the ground. From 1982 to 1987 it doubled from £12 billion to £24 billion under that great economist, Dr. Garret FitzGerald. From 1987 onwards the brakes were put on and all Governments since have followed the lead given in 1987 and which was necessary to bring our economy out of danger of being taken over by the IMF.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil was last in opposition we looked at what needed to be done to ensure the continued growth of the economy. We prepared a tax reform document for 1997 to 2002 which the Minister for Finance is now implementing and refining. That document contained plans to reduce the taxation rates, such as reducing the top rate of income tax to 44% over a five year period and reducing the standard rate to 20%. We are bringing both rates down by 2% this year. We were going to bring in a carer's tax allowance and that has been done. The document also stated that we would consider reducing capital gains tax and that was done, bringing great returns to the State. The document stated we would clarify the role of ownership of semi-State bodies and this is continuing. The document proposed getting four in five employees on to the standard rate of tax and with the policy of increasing the tax bands and allowances, we are on the road to achieving that. We proposed introducing tax credits to create a more equitable tax system and that has commenced. It is not yet fully developed, but it will be by the time we leave Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton said we were lucky that we were able to fall into government with all this money. We were lucky, but people make their own luck. The Minister for Finance was attacked because, when under pressure, he brought in the £3,000 allowance for stay at home spouses, <Col N="34" /> whether they are caring for children or disabled people. That was also a published part of our policy. If I was Minister I would have brought it in at the very beginning of our period in government, but I am not the Minister. The Minister promised he would do it and he did so. Those who made a song and dance about individualisation initially talked of it as if it were a change in principle from what had been in our taxation system. That is not correct; it was a change in the level of allowances granted to two different sets of people. The principle was already established in that if both a husband and wife worked outside the home, each received a PAYE allowance whereas only one PAYE allowance was granted if only one of them worked outside the home. The principle already existed but the difference in take home pay was one of the reasons for the discontent about this issue. The Minister changed the provision and I do not see anything wrong with somebody recognising the need for change and, accordingly, making that change. I would not have been elected to this House 18 years ago but for a particular Minister for Finance imposing tax on footwear in January 1981. He did not get outside the door of this House with those proposals. That Minister was asked to change the provision but was unwilling to do so. We must be flexible and apply common sense in regard to these matters. The Minister to whom I refer also failed on a subsequent occasion when the Labour Party jumped ship because of his proposals. Perhaps some more members of the Fine Gael Party should also consider jumping ship given that he has such a bad record.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is to be welcomed as it will deliver the largest tax package in the history of the State, a fact which is widely acknowledged. Some people may not yet appreciate this as the media have overemphasised the slight disparities in tax allowances without providing a full explanation of their effects. When people receive their first wage packets after 1 April, they will realise they are gaining significantly from the Bill's provisions. More than £1 billion is being provided in personal tax reductions in addition to the £1 billion provided in the two previous budgets. We were informed that £600 million or £700 million in tax cuts was required and more than £1 billion was provided. Yet, some people persist in saying that we are not giving enough. There is an onus on Government when times are good not to waste the State's finances but to spend them wisely.</P>
    <P>Inflation and the overheating of the economy were referred to. Some European economists have stated that the increase in tax allowances is too generous and that the economy will implode. Our own economists point out that our economy is not similar to the European system and can withstand increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>The budget and the Finance Bill will result in an additional 70,000 people being removed from the tax net. It is our duty to look after the elderly and, in this regard, an additional 10,000 people over 65 years of age will be exempted from the <Col N="35" /> taxation system. The widening of the standard tax band will remove 125,000 taxpayers from the top tax band making them liable to tax at 22% rather than 44%. That is something of which we could only have dreamt five years ago. The increase in PAYE allowances to £500 for a single person and £1,000 for a married person means a person must earn £110 before coming into the tax net. An extra £10 per week amounts to £520 over a year and is not an insignificant increase. It would be considered significant if it were a wage increase.</P>
    <P>I welcome the exemption of shared family homes from capital acquisitions tax which has caused great problems over the years for brothers, sisters, nephews or nieces who lived with relatives. In regard to qualification for agricultural relief, I welcome the increase from 75% to 80% of the beneficiaries' assets; 80% of assets must now comprise agricultural property. The increase in the threshold for residential property tax from £200,000 to £300,000 is also welcome. I welcome this Bill which will ensure Ireland continues to grow and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, to ask the Minister for Finance to consider providing tax relief for parents to purchase information technology equipment for their children. The continuing growth of this country will depend on properly educated and computer literate young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Durkan sought to impute such machiavellian motives to the Government and assure him that sort of disgraceful manoeuvring is the furthest thing from our minds. I concur with Deputy Ahern about the need for flexibility in government, particularly on the part of Ministers for Finance. For a person to change his or her mind merely implies the person is wiser today than he or she was yesterday. Had Deputy John Bruton learned that lesson, his career path might have taken a different course.</P>
      <P>There is perhaps a grain of truth in Deputy Durkan's advice in regard to trips to the plinth. He should consult his constituency colleague, Deputy Dukes, about that as we will all recall that his return from the wilderness was preceded by several appearances on plinths throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on this Bill which is a further instalment in a comprehensive package of tax reform he initiated on taking office. The changes and reforms he introduced have rightly earned him the respect and admiration of everyone who understands how the Irish taxation system works. Some of his reforms have been misrepresented, deliberately or otherwise, for example, in regard to the change in tax as it applies to bookmakers, with which Deputy Yates will be familiar, and the decision to slash the basic rate of capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> The Minister's brave decisions have been vindicated by their out-turn. When this Bill becomes law, the standard rate of tax &ndash; that paid by two out of every three taxpayers &ndash; will be at its lowest level since before World War II. It might prove salutary to reflect on that. It is worthwhile remembering that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has not finished. His stated objective, which I have no doubt he will attain, is that when this Government goes before the people to seek renewal of its mandate, four out of five taxpayers will pay income tax at an even lower standard rate. That is real progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been accused on many occasions of being ideologically committed to the rich and favouring them in Finance Bills, budgets, policy pronouncements and so on. The financial legislation introduced by the Minister is replete with examples which belie that assertion. For example, it is salutary to reflect that when this Bill becomes law, a jointly assessed married man over 65 years will be exempt from income tax if his income does not exceed £15,000 per annum, which is almost £300 per week.</P>
    <P>Corporation tax continues to fall, in line with the long-standing target of an ultimate 12.5% rate. This is in the interests of the economy and the Minister will achieve it. The Government is committed to a lower tax rate economy and the Minister has resolutely and rightly refused to allow himself to be deflected by the occasional carping of our EU partners and the discordant background noises from those who see it as their mission in life to promote policies which deal exclusively with the distribution of wealth at the expense of policies which lead to its creation.</P>
    <P>Capital acquisitions tax has been radically restructured. The extension of the 20% rate and the long overdue increase in thresholds, which reflects the substantial growth in the value of capital assets in this country, mean that before long the distinction between income tax and capital acquisitions tax will have disappeared, to all intents and purposes. Many provisions in the capital acquisitions tax reforms introduced by the Minister in the past two and a half years remain unsung. For example, section 127 provides that if a farmer does not qualify for agricultural relief, he or she will be entitled to business relief. This is a substantial boon which has not been referred to in the media.</P>
    <P>The war on tax evasion is being stepped up significantly. The fact that a special levy on the financial institutions which colluded in DIRT fraud is absent from the Bill does not mean they will escape unscathed. Penalties and interest on back tax since 1996 will yield a significant levy. I can already hear the howls of anguish from boardrooms around the country. The Government's proposals in this regard represent one of the most comprehensive onslaughts in our history on the Irish culture of tax evasion. Section 56 substantially increases the Revenue's powers of audit in the case of DIRT returns by financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan recently referred on the <Col N="37" /> national airwaves to the new &ldquo;handyman&rdquo; phenomenon in taxation. He alleged that the change from a domicile base to a residence base in relation to capital acquisitions tax will open the door to tax avoidance or tax evasion &ndash; he used the expressions intermittently and I am not sure he understands the distinction. I wish to make it clear that the change in the basis of charging for capital acquisitions tax from domicile &ndash; a vague, abstract concept &ndash; to residence, is in line with every other similar tax jurisdiction. It is perfectly tailored to suit the change in economic circumstances which has resulted in a large number of people coming in and going out of the country. Domicile is a vague, abstract concept and residence is clear. If CAT on foreign assets remains the same, I predict that many transfers of foreign assets which hitherto escaped capital acquisitions tax will be caught as a result of the changes introduced in this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the case of Claire Proes<i> v.</i> Revenue Commissioners &ndash; Irish Reports, 1998, IV, p.174 &ndash; , the High Court made it clear that in relation to domicile, the correct question to be answered in any case was whether the appellant had abandoned their domicile of origin, not whether they had acquired a new domicile of choice in this State. In seeking to establish domicile of origin and prove it had been abandoned, in which case no tax would apply, the onus is on the Revenue. Instead of opening the door to widespread tax avoidance of capital acquisitions tax, precisely the opposite will be achieved. Deputy Noonan's assertions in this regard betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the law. That is what one gets for sending a handyman to do a job which is more appropriate to a professional.</P>
    <P>I welcome the obligatory technical changes to the save-as-you-earn scheme. However, the Minister for Finance has stated that he intends to introduce radical changes to profit sharing schemes. I urge him to introduce these at the earliest possible opportunity. The high technology sector has been the lynchpin of our new prosperity. In order to continue to attract the necessary skills to sustain our competitive position in this vital area, we need to adjust the tax system. Ireland's tax treatment of employee share options must rival that of our global competitors. It will be argued that in the interests of tax equity, it may not be possible to do that. Equity has nothing to do with it &ndash; it is about naked greed and acquisitiveness. If we want to attract highly valued skills we must be in a position to give a similar remuneration package to that offered by our competitors. The skills of those we are seeking to attract to this sector are extremely mobile. If we do not provide the same as our competitors we will inevitably lose out to them. There are over 700 software companies operating here and there is a new start-up every week. Despite this, only 40 of those companies employ more than 50 people. The sector cannot achieve its full potential if these companies do not consolidate and focus on global leadership.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> Export growth in the sector has been spectacular &ndash; 20% per annum for the past five years. More than 80% of the indigenous product is exported. This can only continue if companies here can actively recruit world leaders in their niche technologies. They can only do that if they can offer competitive remuneration packages. The individuals they are seeking to attract expect stock options. This is an area where we could quickly lose competitive advantage. It is not a future case scenario. I know the Minister's intentions in this regard are good and I urge him to bring forward those changes at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on continuing along the path of fundamental, necessary and welcome reform of the taxation system &ndash; reform in the interests of equity and the economy. I think it was Aristotle who said it was not possible to both tax and please. He was subsequently plagiarised by Edmund Burke, Conor Cruise O'Brien's hero. The package of tax reforms introduced by the Minister since his accession to office, particularly those contained in this Finance Bill disproves that to a great extent. He is to be heartily congratulated. Long may the work continue &ndash; before we leave office and seek a renewed mandate, we will achieve our target of reducing corporation tax to the target outlined in our programme for Government. We will achieve the target of having four out of five taxpayers on a 20% rate of tax. This Bill is a necessary milestone on the way to achieving those desirable objectives. I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill is the primary economic policy instrument of the management of the economy, given that exchange rate policy is fixed with the euro, inflation seems to be beyond the control of the Minister and interest rates are primarily set by the European Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in this regard I wish to make my first comments. I want to put on record my belief that the palpable and definite seeds of the movement from economic boom to economic burst are being laid in the first quarter of the year 2000. All the warning signals exist about the rise in interest rates and the highest inflation rate in Europe at double the European average. All the issues that are at the root of Ireland's competitiveness are being eroded. There is total disregard on the part of the Minister for Finance for a fiscal policy that will do anything other than throw petrol on the flames of translating from boom to burst. He is determined to disregard all external advice. If he looks at the performance of the Irish Stock Exchange and whether there is a vote of confidence from foreign investors, he will see there has been a sea change in attitude to the economy. In <Col N="39" /> relation to pay, once blue flu occurred, the Government's economic credibility on controlling pay went out the window. Pay rates will rise by approximately 12% in the next 14 months. The baseline has been established in the programme for fairness, love, prosperity and so on, but the reality is that already the teachers' unions, the bus workers and so on are lining up, creating an opening pitch, and a very serious situation is emerging. The Government is not concerned. The economy is on auto pilot, revenue exceeds expectations and things roll merrily on.</P>
    <P>The Minister lectured the rainbow Government on a mantra of controlling public expenditure. Some 4% per annum was the pre-election commitment, but public expenditure has risen by over 20% in the past two years, and it is rising rapidly. I want to put on record that all the historic cyclical signs exist that we are going in the wrong direction. No one in Government is concerned, they are totally preoccupied with patting themselves on the back, saying what a good job they are doing, ensuring that every issue is fudged and that no one rocks the boat. This will be all right for the time being, but it will be all wrong in due course. The only people crying halt are those in Brussels, people in the European Central Bank and foreign investment brokers. Even the domestic economic prophets are all caught up with the present propaganda and do not seem to recognise the serious warning signals. In due course, when this unfortunately comes to pass, which is regrettable and somewhat avoidable, I want to have it on the record that it was said at this time.</P>
    <P>Businesses have a huge competitive advantage given that the Irish pound is 78p against sterling, but some of the chickens will come home to roost when this is no longer the case. I cannot understand, in the context of a pay agreement and inflation being such a key issue, how the Government allowed a 1% increase in the CPI through the increase in cigarettes. I agree there should be an active deterrent to the usage of cigarettes and smoking, but there should have been a <i>pro rata</i> reduction. Using the surplus funds that are overshooting each month to reduce prices would have been a sensible way to keep inflation at 3% even by way of the domestic assessment through the CPI. This would at least give the impression abroad that inflation is under control. It would have been easy for the Minister to do this and it is regrettable that no one in Government seems to have thought of this.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is too much money chasing too many limited factors in the economy. The shortage of workers is driving pay rates. The minimum wage no longer matters. The traditionally lowest paid jobs in the economy are now paying well above £5 per hour. Minimum pay is already in operation. Job shortages are in the region of 64,000. However, service inflation currently exceeds 6%. All the warning signals exist. <Col N="40" /> These are not my statistics, but I can see matters getting much worse.</P>
    <P>On taxation policy, I welcome the Minister's complete U-turn from budget day in relation to individualisation which has been greatly watered down. There has been a meagre recognition of the stay-at-home spouse and the social partners have made the Minister change completely his policy on the low paid. He proposed that the tax free allowance would be increased from £100 to £110 per week for a single person, but the programme for love, fairness, partnership and so on proposes that the minimum wage should be £200 per week. When we proposed £170 per week last fall, it was rubbished by the Taoiseach who said it could not be afforded. I am pleased the Government has now moved in that direction. However, it is unfair that two earners in one household will hit the top rate of tax at £56,000, whereas a single earner will hit it at £28,000. The focus on the top rate of tax is not the problem &ndash; 44p in the pound is not an unreasonable rate of tax. The problem is that single people hit the top rate at £14,500 heretofore. The problem is the rate at which it applies.</P>
    <P>The way to deal with this problem is to introduce a new middle rate of income tax of 35p in the pound, not to keep cutting the top tax rate because that confers the biggest benefits on the best off. Middle income earners should pay a new middle rate of tax of 35p in the pound. The £3,000 tax allowance has created huge anomalies. For example, someone who is sick and works in the home will not get the £3,000 allowance. Someone whose spouse is in a nursing home will not qualify. A spouse who is on disability benefit will not qualify. A single person acting as a carer cannot avail of this allowance whereas other carers in the home can. There are clear anomalies in this measure.</P>
    <P>On economic management and the partnership agreement, the failure to deal with child care is quite clear-cut. It is acknowledged by the social partners that they failed to reach agreement on this issue. It is obvious that children under five years of age who are not in the formal education system require more child care where two people must work to pay the mortgage. Therefore, child benefit should be £25 per week for children under five years of age. When they are in the formal education system the cost to the State is so much greater and this needs to be looked at. The failure to deal with this serious issue is acknowledged in the partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>I regret the Finance Bill has failed to deal with the problems of the credit unions. If one invests in a bank, one will pay DIRT at 20p per pound. If one receives a credit union dividend one will pay at the marginal rate of tax which in many instances is 44p in the pound.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with a specific matter on Report Stage. This relates to sections 77, 78 and 79 and the fuel rebate on low sulphur content diesel oil. I have received representations from the Coach Tourism Council to say that only <Col N="41" /> CIE can benefit from this new rebate. I would like the Minister to revisit the issue and give a level playing pitch to all coach tour operators.</P>
    <P>Things have been bigger, better, onward and upward in the economy, but that is not the prognosis for the future. Inflation and costs are out of control and we will lose competitiveness. We are at a crucial turning point in the economy's performance and, unfortunately, whether in relation to house prices or whatever, we are predictably moving from boom to burst.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that small enterprises now employ more than half the labour force. These 160,000 enterprises form the backbone of employment and accounted for more than 150,000 new jobs in the economy over the past four years. The owners of these enterprises must cope with the fundamental changes occurring today by identifying and dealing with all the risks which may affect the work being carried out by the company.</P>
      <P>The competitive environment for small businesses is all embracing. Due to the size of the domestic economy, many small companies are highly dependent on export markets. Competitiveness is a day to day reality for business, embracing economic and physical infrastructure, management expertise, labour costs, productivity, innovation, education, training, marketing and design, cost control and a variety of other factors which combined create the environment for business and ensure the profitability necessary for enterprise to survive, invest and expand.</P>
      <P>Interest rates are of major concern to the business community at present. Interest rates are volatile at present and the current figure is over 4%. Last year interest rates increased promptly in response to international developments and this was justified by the Central Bank on the basis of maintaining our ERM position and the need to avoid large outflows. However, many people are concerned that the current high level of interest rates will have a negative effect on business and associated maintenance costs.</P>
      <P>From a business point of view, a marketing campaign should be undertaken to promote the county enterprise boards as first stop shops for people trying to access information. Much more work could be done in this area for people setting up businesses. County enterprise boards do not have sufficient funds and the rate of corporation tax on profits should be reduced more quickly from 25% to 12.5%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received many representations to the effect that the PAYE allowance should be extended to proprietor directors, all self-employed taxpayers and spouses engaged in a family business. This is most important. Although the Department said the cost of implementing the recommendations is prohibitive, the PAYE allowance should be abolished and the money redistributed among employees, proprietor directors, self-employed people working in a trade or profession and spouses working in a family busi<Col N="42" /> ness in the form of increased personal allowances. Owner occupiers, particularly of companies, are not receiving any benefits and this matter should be considered.</P>
    <P>Commercial rates are an unfair burden and an arbitrary form of taxation and they should be examined with a view to reducing them. Rates on business are an indirect form of taxation. The rates are not tax allowable and people with small businesses who not making any profit must still pay them. In some cases, the rates amount to thousands of pounds and the people concerned find it extremely difficult to pay them. From personal experience, I am aware that some businesses find them extremely difficult to pay.</P>
    <P>Roll over relief should be introduced where proceeds from the disposal of business assets acquired by inheritance or as gifts are subsequently reinvested in another business. This area should also be considered.</P>
    <P>The FÁS apprenticeship scheme is too inflexible. Small firms find it difficult to accommodate the block release of apprentices for 20 weeks in module two, ten weeks in module four and a further ten weeks in module six. The main difficulty is the lack of operational flexibility for small companies and the net result is that companies do not train apprentices. This has decimated some of the trades and led to a great shortage of sheet metal workers, electricians, plumbers, etc. There is a lesson to be learned in this regard. The old method of day release and evening classes is more manageable for small companies. An updated version of this system should be introduced. A review of the apprenticeship scheme should be undertaken with a view to introducing a scheme that is more flexible, would encourage in-house training and is tailored to customer needs. The Minister should give a tax concession to businesses, with accreditation from FÁS and the training agencies, to train people in their companies because the current system, which involves releasing people for three or months, is a major difficulty.</P>
    <P>The current system of providing grant assistance to companies employing more than ten people is a form of employment grants. Many companies would benefit more if they received support which was not linked to job creation because in many cases taking on an extra employee for the sake of getting assistance is more restrictive than helpful to the company's growth and profitability. Assistance should be focused away from labour and towards companies with profit and growth potential. The issue of companies getting employment grants is major. The largest single investment a company makes today is in personnel; they can pay up to £20,000 for an employee. Companies are being encouraged to take on people for the sake of the Minister's job creation figures. In certain cases companies are taking on staff but they are not making profits. A due diligence investigation of a company would show its profitability and whether it would grow and its viability would increase if a <Col N="43" /> grant was provided. This would be better than encouraging companies to take on employees without a viability study.</P>
    <P>To succeed in business firms must be innovative and stay close to markets which are becoming increasingly competitive. In addition to managing the overall change in business effectively, innovation involves selling new and modified products. In terms of research and development, it has been shown that of the top 50 companies only five had proper R&amp;D divisions. This aspect should be considered in the context of the growth of small companies.</P>
    <P>There are huge barriers to enterprise. For example, the Minister should consider simplifying administration in business in terms of PAYE, VAT and corporation tax. Every small business must employ a full-time secretary to deal with all the red tape. The audit requirements should be linked to the consumer price index and the statutory auditing of companies with a turnover of less than £100,000 should be abolished.</P>
    <P>There should be increased interaction between the teachers' unions and the Department with regard to the education and training system with a view to increasing awareness of careers in enterprise and business. Unfortunately, the school system only caters for people considering undertaking academic degrees. It does not cater for people who want to be plumbers or electricians. Those areas have been down-scaled. There is a need for refocusing in the education system. Videos should be produced for schools on different trades and what it would be like to be a plumber, an electrician or a carpenter. They are important trades and people are having extreme difficulty getting a qualified tradesperson at present.</P>
    <P>Enterprise boards should be restructured to ensure that representatives of small business make up 25% of the membership. There are 160,000 small companies in Ireland and they have created the bulk of the jobs in recent years. However, there is no regard for small businesses. A person who wishes to start a company with only two employees cannot approach the enterprise board because it only deals with companies with over ten employees. I have expertise in the area of small business and the Government is not catering for such companies.</P>
    <P>Regarding take home salaries and the tax free allowance of £79, the minimum wage of £4.40 an hour will be introduced shortly. However, it is disingenuous of the Government to introduce the minimum wage in the absence of tax reform. People do not consider the gross salary of £176 a week, based on £4.40 an hour; they are entitled to that amount, but they should not have to pay tax on any amount above £79. The tax allowance should be £150. The requirement to pay tax on amounts above £79 is totally wrong. Amounts up £150 should be exempt from taxation. This change should be made in conjunction with the introduction of the minimum wage. All the fan<Col N="44" /> fare about the introduction of the minimum wage in the absence of tax reform is a joke.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience of employing people that they do not look at their gross salary. They want to know what is in it for them.</P>
    <P>When they open their wage packets will they get £150 or £180 out of £300 gross? On a previous occasion I heard the Minister say that a married person on £15,000 should not pay any tax at the age of 65. That is no consolation to a young person starting off who has to pay tax or earnings over £79, car expenses and incur travelling expenses getting to work. Employers cannot get people to work solely because there is not an incentive for them, as the benefits from the social welfare system are on a par with the benefits of going to work. That system must change. There should be immediate tax reform to ensure that the salaries people take home are adequate. There is a huge difference between gross pay and take home pay. Deputy Noonan has clearly established that tax reform starts at the bottom whereas this budget started at the top and thus benefits those on high salaries. People at the lower end of the scale who are starting off should be given incentives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Deputy Perry who knows what he is talking about in terms of small business. Coming from a rural constituency in the centre of the border, midlands and western region he understands the day to day problems of ordinary workers. His central point of tax reform, starting from the bottom up, is absolutely right.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill that was not contained in the budget except for the changes in respect of the £3,000 allowance for the stay at home spouses. This Finance Bill was introduced by a Minister for Finance who is discredited by his own party. When the row initially broke out about the £3,000 allowance for stay at home spouses it was a deliberate tactic to remove the credit from those in the Independent benches who would claim it, to send out battalion after battalion of Fianna Fáil speaker on the plinth &ndash; an unheard of proposition previously &ndash; to discredit their own Minister for Finance. In my 25 years here it has never happened that a Minister for Finance proposing a budget would be overruled by the Cabinet and his colleagues and still remain in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a likeable person whom I know since he became a Member in 1977. He introduced the Finance Bill with a cloud hanging over him, which was put there by his own party, and a certain amount of discredit as a consequence. Whether that influenced his approach to dealing with the credit unions remains to be seen. I cannot understand it. The problem here is a taxation matter and deals with taxation relevant to hundreds of thousands of small savers throughout the country and yet the Minister has publicly refused to meet the Irish League of Credit Unions. Why? Because of his obstinacy and refusal to meet them <Col N="45" /> the Independent Members put pressure on the Government. As a consequence the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste decided to meet the league of credit unions. What kind of Government is this? Who is in charge? Is this an effort by the Minister for Finance to stand his ground and the Taoiseach can meet them if he wishes. We know that the Taoiseach is amenable to meeting all and sundry. In the past week he launched Paudie O'Shea's Gaeltacht tournament, the AIB club championship, he called in to see Mick O'Connell and now he is on his way to Eddie Jordan in Brisbane. The intricacy of politics and sport is very evident in this Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance introduced the Finance Bill, discredited by his own party and wounded politically as a consequence. The Tánaiste said this is not about money but about imagination. I live in the border, midlands and western region &ndash; the centre of the Objective one status area approved by Government after an attempt to include west Kerry and west Cork &ndash; where we are told that £6 million per day will come into this region for the next six years. It is the management and the effective spending of that money that causes me concern. Without effective co-ordination most of it will be wasted.</P>
      <P>Recently the Government having arrived in Knock Airport, had a jamboree in Ballaghadereen, met the farmers and so on. However, even after meeting in the house of the late great James Dillon in Ballaghaderreen and having attended the launch of the Western Development Commission in the esteemed square in Ballaghaderreen, money has not yet been allocated to that commission, whose filing cabinets are stuffed with applications for equity, shareholding and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the length and breadth of the Western Development Commission nothing can be done about these applications because approval has not been given by Brussels. Despite the billions of pounds lavished all over the place from Malin Head to Dingle, not a bob has yet been allocated to the Western Development Commission. That commission is strangled, frustrated and has no money. Yet we hear about the free flowing economy, an inclusive society and all the other wonderful and wild things that are to happen in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competitiveness in an Irish sense is critical for the future. Half the money generated in this economy comes from multinational companies. When I had the opportunity and the privilege to serve as Minister for Tourism and Trade we dealt with the up to date presentations from former <Col N="46" /> eastern bloc countries wishing to join the European Union. They made their presentations with a passion and a fanaticism that will bear fruit in their countries in due course. They have an extremely good education system. They have turned their back on Communist countries and want to embrace western democracy and western ways of doing business. Unless we invest more in our education system and unless the training mentioned by Deputy Perry, from the ground up, is available we stand to lose substantial amounts of money in the coming years, and our workforce will not be able to match up.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise and Employment says that in an international sense we should be dealing with China. I know from first hand experience, having led trade delegations abroad, that the British send delegations abroad for six or nine months of the year. Their Minister is away all the time. I make the observation that any Government should appoint a Minister of State, who will not stand again, who can concentrate on leading delegations internationally because ministerial involvement opens doors that will never again be opened in a business sense. It is difficult for the Tánaiste or any Minister with responsibility for trade to concentrate on the job of Government while opening doors in an international trading sense for Ireland. It is wrong to invest in China rather we should invest in India which is an English speaking country which has the second largest population, a stable Government, and has gone into high technology with an involvement in a traditional sense with Ireland, in that Ghandi came here to see what Mr. de Valera was doing at the beginning of this State. There are strong missionary relationships there and very strong research and development and hi-tech relationships that should be built on. It is an English speaking country, outward-looking and open to that kind of involvement and we should get involved.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is available to people who live close by the person being cared for. I brought a case to his attention recently, that of a man living on his own who will not have a relationship with any family members except his daughter-in-law, her husband and their children who live seven or eight miles away. Her husband is a shift worker and she can have the car only when he is off work. The Department say the allowance is not available unless the carer is within walking distance. In rural areas different things dictate where one buys a site, gets planning permission and so on. The regulation regarding living close by should be interpreted flexibly and with a light touch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Pat Carey. I was very surprised to hear Deputy Yates's boom to bust speech in which he claimed that the economy is falling apart and that the country will be on its knees in a very short time. His hysterical, historical and cyclical signs point to the fact that the country is in ruins. We <Col N="47" /> hear much talk these days of economic immigrants. I wonder that Deputy Yates is not an economic emigrant in view of his opinion of the country's economic performance. He laughs off the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness as a love-in in Government Buildings but the opinion poll in last week's <i>Sunday Independent, </i>which I am sure Deputy Yates did not enjoy reading, indicated that 55% of the population feel the programme is a good one while only 16% hold the opposite view. This augurs well for the acceptance of the programme among all the social partners in the time to come.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates also suggested that the Minister has done a U-turn on individualisation. This is not true. In three years time, March 2002, when we will still be on this side of the House and Deputy Yates will be calling for an election &ndash; depending on the previous week's <i>Sunday Independent </i>poll &ndash;  the third phase of the individualisation programme will be put in place. We have a special regard for the family as the basic building block of our society. Measures must be continued to recognise its position. The special £3,000 tax allowance, which all carers in the home will receive, must be increased in future. However, our regard for the family is quite separate from the concept of individualisation. Individualisation was accepted by all the social partners who negotiated the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry has said that small businesses are in disarray because interest rates are at 4%. In the early 1980s interest rates rose to 20% and it was not until 1987 when Fianna Fáil had an input in the national economy that things began to improve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Finucane cannot say that on the basis of interest rates at the time. Industries complained then, but now they are well able to manage interest repayments. Deputy Perry displays an excellent grasp of his brief. However, I must inform him that enterprise boards deal with companies with fewer than ten employees. Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland deal with companies with more than ten employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of care and management in relation to the tax Acts came to the fore recently. The care and management provision is dealt with in section 141 which states that, &ldquo;All taxes and duties imposed by this Act are by virtue of this section placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;. All tax Bills and consolidated tax Acts contain this provision. What is &ldquo;care and management&ldquo;? This question arose during the DIRT inquiry. Does it mean the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to write off <Col N="48" /> huge amounts of tax or does it mean they are only entitled to write off a small amount of tax because it would be more expensive to collect it than to write it off? This question of whether the Revenue Commissioners have the authority to give an amnesty to a bank or banks and to write off tax, arose during the inquiry. I do not believe the duty of care and management allows the Revenue to write off liability for tax which would be collectable at a cost less than the amount of tax to be collected. I would like to see a clearer definition of care and management and of the methods used by the Revenue to deal with the tax system included in the tax Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 140 inserts a new section 1006B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to deal with the appropriation of payments. It often happens that individuals overpay taxes for certain years and underpay for others. Until recently such taypayers received bills for the years they had underpaid while there was not any reference to the years in which they had overpaid. If taxes have been overpaid the Revenue Commissioners should allocate the overpayment to the years when tax was underpaid so that no liability is outstanding.</P>
    <P>Section 138 deals with the question of the publication of settlements with the Revenue Commissioners. To have evaded tax and to have stolen from one's fellow citizen is not a badge of honour. It is a shameful thing to do and we should persuade the public that publication of one's name for non-payment of tax is shameful and something to be frowned upon.</P>
    <P>The question arises of whether disclosure should be prohibited in cases involving voluntary disclosure. What is a voluntary disclosure? If a non-compliant taxpayer knows he will be caught and makes a voluntary disclosure at the last minute, can this be called an involuntary voluntary disclosure? If it becomes known, for example, that account holders of a particular bank are to be pursued by the Revenue Commissioners within two months, could disclosure by account holders in such circumstances be called voluntary? I do not believe it could. The question of what constitutes a voluntary disclosure must be examined.</P>
    <P>The question of disclosure where the settlement does not exceed £10,000 also arises. This should be questioned and the care and management provisions should be brought into play. If, for example, a person underestimates his or her travel expenses or makes a similar genuine error and underpays by an amount less than £10,000, I can accept that the matter should not be published. However, where actual fraud is involved the matter should be published, even when the amount involved is less than £10,000.</P>
    <P>On donations of important heritage items, relief is being increased from £750,000 to £3 million as requested by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This has the support of the whole House. I understand there is a selection committee which will ensure the State gets good value and nobody is allowed to over-<Col N="49" /> value a particular item in donating items of national heritage to museums and galleries. I am delighted with this proposal.</P>
    <P>One of the best provisions in the budget and the Bill is the one under which brothers or sisters or two partners or friends who have been living together for at least three years, who have no interest in any other dwelling and will continue to live in the house, will be able to inherit the dwelling-house in which they are living without having to come up with a sizeable amount to pay capital acquisitions tax. In many cases up to now the dwelling-house had to be sold to pay the tax as the person concerned was not in a position to raise a mortgage as they had insufficient income to service it. This measure therefore is a source of great relief for a large number of people. I have received a number of telephone calls in connection with it and I am aware that Deputies from all sides of the House made representations in relation to it.</P>
    <P>The question of capital acquisitions tax is tackled well and ably in the Bill. Although house values have increased substantially in recent years the thresholds, in particular for sons and daughters, have remained at the same level for a long period. I am delighted that they are now being raised and that there will be a 20% tax rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will introduce new sections dealing with share options on Committee Stage. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, referred to this matter in a substantial way. I agree with him. I heard Deputy McDowell say in throwaway remarks that he does not want to see them being introduced for a few individuals in hi-tech industries. I am sure that he and the House recognise the importance of e-commerce internationally. We can ensure Ireland maintains its competitiveness, continues to grow and that there is an increase in GNP by ensuring we are part of that business and that our international markets continue to increase. There are thousands of young entrepreneurs who are setting up software, website and e-commerce companies to sell products over the Internet who have small amounts of money to invest. They need highly trained staff who can demand salaries between £75,000 and £100,000 in London and New York. They are prepared to invest £20,000 a year in and work for a new business venture in Ireland provided they know that there is something to be gained in the future if the company develops and attains value. These are the innovative companies in which all employees can participate on a share option basis.</P>

In an interjection he suggested the economy was in good hands in 1987, the year in which his party left office and in which officers of the World Bank were as near as made no difference to the front gates of Government Buildings to take over the shop. In the last ten years 500,000 new jobs have been created and unemployment has decreased from about 17% to less than 5%. A total of 1,000 emigrants are now being attracted home each week. A similar number of new homes are being built every week. These statistics speak for themselves but the Deputy will have an opportunity of addressing them from his perspective later.</P>
      <P>The budget must be placed in the context of the national development plan and, more recently, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The Bill copperfastens the announcements made in the budget. While I expressed concern about certain elements at the time, I did not attack the Minister on the plinth. In fact I was accused of being overly defensive of the position taken by him but it was one of a series of reforming budgets. As my colleague, Deputy Ardagh, said, by the time we face the electorate a series of reforming measures in the area of personal taxation will have been put in place.</P>
      <P>The budget and the Bill will put more money in people's pockets and encourage more people to return to the workforce. In recent weeks I attended a meeting of the local drugs task force in which I am involved in my area at which we were given the most recent long-term unemployment figures for Finglas and Cabra. I was taken aback. As of mid-January 350 people in Cabra were termed long-term unemployed and 460 in Finglas. The figure for Ballymun in my constituency is significantly higher, although there has been a reduction of about 35% in the level of unemployment in the area. Incentives are therefore being provided to return to work.</P>
      <P>The Government has been criticised for setting the national minimum wage at £4.40 but this figure is almost redundant. Even McDonalds is offering a higher rate but it is important that a minimum rate is set. It is an indication that the wages of low paid workers will be protected. I am glad that my concerns have been understood and underpinned in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, particularly by the community and voluntary pillar, to encourage the low paid to return to work.</P>
      <P>The issues on which I wish to focus include taxation. On inheritance tax, I welcome the raising of the threshold from £192,000 to £300,000 where gifts are passed from parents to their children. Even in areas where dwellings are modestly priced inheritance tax has to be paid and it can be penal. I welcome the Minister's decision.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>The Law Reform Commission has dealt with the majority of projects under its first programme for law reform. The commission is preparing a new draft programme pursuant to section 4 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, in consultation with the Attorney General for submission to the Government.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Law Reform Commission Act allow for the consideration by the commission of proposals for law reform submitted to it for inclusion in the programme. In addition, I would be happy to receive any such suggestions from the party leaders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the prioritisation of the laws to be reformed, as distinct from the technical production of legal solutions, is a matter primarily for elected politicians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a difficulty with that. I examined the data for the past 25 years, which is a fairly long and fair period. While the commission examined five areas under its remit, practically all the other areas, which runs to 20 or 30, were referred by the Attorney General and I think arose from political discussion and debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach agrees with that, does he also agree that, in setting priority projects for the Law Reform Commission, there should be formal consultation with Opposition party leaders and with the parliamentary parties to allow all Members, through the party structure, to contribute their views on the prioritisation of work given that it is likely that virtually all the parties will be in Government at some stage during the course of the work of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I would be happy to receive any suggestions from party leaders and by that I mean party leaders would represent their parliamentary parties. Given the length of time it has taken to deal with issues and having regard to the areas referred by Attorneys General over the years, it covers a long period. The areas covered show the good work done by the com<Col N="52" /> mission, which has often been referred to generally in the House. Perhaps the Law Reform Commission did not take account of this. When one considers the areas covered and the legislation which has come, in one form or another, from the commission, one realises it has done very valuable work.</P>
      <P>In regard to the discussion which is taking place in the commission and the contact with the Attorney General, I will make sure any issues which are brought to my attention by the party leaders, through the political system, will be brought to the attention of commission for inclusion in its report. I would be pleased to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question put by Deputy Bruton warrants a more comprehensive and penetrating response than that indicated by the Taoiseach. After 25 years of experience and at a time of partnership, does the Taoiseach agree it would be more appropriate for the Law Reform Commission, which is the creature of no particular party or administration, to consult an appropriate committee of this House instead of going off on its own programme of work, albeit influenced by the Attorney General? I suggest for consideration the constitutional review committee as one example of such a non-partisan or sectoral body to jointly agree the areas of our antiquated legislation that are in need of reform.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to suggest to the Attorney General and the Law Reform Commission that they meet a committee of the House to discuss its programme and to take on board whatever inputs might come on an all-party basis from such an Oireachtas committee? It is ultimately this House which will have the task of enacting any reforming legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the committee on justice and law reform would be appropriate because most of the issues would relate to it. I do not have a difficulty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Taoiseach does not have a difficulty with it, but will he take it on board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would. I spent quite a few hours over the weekend reading what has gone on over the past 25 years. Even though I was involved in the process over the years, I never read back over all the submissions, cases and so on which have developed. Most of the commission's work stems from issues which arise in the House. Most of the suggestions and ideas come from this House. Issues such as bail, liability, confiscation of the proceeds of crime, sentencing policies and even gazumping, which arose last year, were raised in my time in this House and were referred to the commission. I would <Col N="53" /> have no difficulty with the commission consulting with committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to become a historical revisionist but I think the Taoiseach will agree that in most cases issues were referred by Governments to the Law Reform Commission not because of any high-minded desire to ensure a proper political input to law reform but because the Government of the day did not want to do anything about a problem&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;about which it was getting stick and referred it to the Law Reform Commission to buy time.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree we need a more positive way to manage the political input of a proactive nature to the prioritisation of work? I invite the Taoiseach to write to all parties in the House, including his own, which is the largest, asking the members of the parliamentary parties to consider priorities for law reform and to convene a meeting of all the party leaders to consider the responses which emerge from that process so that Members of both Houses have an input into this discussion rather than the Government referring issues to the commission because it wants to get off the hook?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated at the outset that I would be happy to receive suggestions from party leaders. They could save me the bother of getting the views of all Members. I am open to considering how party leaders want to generate issues for consideration within their parties. Deputy Bruton put forward that suggestion, and Deputy Quinn suggested there should be consultation between the party committees. While Deputy Bruton's historical analysis might be partially true and issues may have been passed or kicked to touch to the commission at one time because people were not sure about how to deal with them, the position becomes clear when one reads in detail &ndash; as I did at the weekend, admittedly for the first time &ndash; what happened over a period of time. A few years ago when we needed legislation to deal with serious crime, the Deputy will recall that we were able to pass without delay the Proceeds of Crime Bill, the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill and the Disclosure of Certain Information Bill because the Law Reform Commission had done most of the work involved some years earlier. I read in detail the other night&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 16 December 1998, 27 April 1999 and 13 October 1999 in response to similar questions, the Government announced on 13 October 1998 that it had agreed to commission a feasibility study for the development of a stadium for the new century and appointed a stadium steering committee to oversee the process.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study, conducted by a consortium of consultants led by PricewaterhouseCoopers, has been completed and presented to the Government with the recommendations of the steering committee. The study and recommendations were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 26 January last.

      <P>Consideration of security for the proposed Government intranet will be ongoing but at this stage the Department is reasonably confident that an appropriate security framework is feasible when the time comes to develop the system. The Deputy will appreciate the importance of deriving maximum benefit from the application of ICTs to the Cabinet process.

Appropriate electronic security to safeguard documents is being examined in terms of who will have access and how they will have it. That is a major task in itself. The aim of the project is to exploit the potential of the available communications and computer technology to electronically transmit documents to streamline the consultation process. Our paper based system of checking and correlation is successful but dated. This involves a major examination. The idea is to link ministerial offices and designated agencies to the Cabinet Secretariat. Ultimately all of this will be done by way of electronic communication. This is being done by major world corporate bodies. If they can do it, we will in time.</P>

Increasingly, &ldquo;bosses&rdquo; have to type their own messages and that requires considerable reskilling at senior level in many organisations where people have not been used to doing that sort of work themselves. Is this aspect receiving attention in our Government which, like many Governments, is a very hierarchical system with a very large number of steps, probably far too many, on that hierarchy?</P>

      <P>Part of this is precisely to identify appropriate electronic security to safeguard such documents. The issue of access is not really an IT issue. It is an issue of administrative decisions. The concept is based on Government ministerial offices and their designated officers being linked to the Secretariat. That having been achieved, there is the potential, a few years down the line, for Government to give directives on certain aspects to agencies under its remit. There is no reason it could not do that, and it would be a wise enough thing to do. However, in relation to the transmission of Government documentation, decisions and memoranda, which is what we are talking about here, security should be tight.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to introduce changes to the Cabinet Handbook covering the acceptance by Ministers of hospitality or gifts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4028/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the matter of acceptance of gifts, including gifts of hospitality, by office holders is regulated by statute, specifically by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. In accordance with section 15(4)(<i>a</i>) of that Act, guidelines in respect of offers or gifts of goods or services have been approved by Government. Any proposals for change in those guidelines is a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Handbook, while reflecting the statutory position &ndash; and appending the current copy of the guidelines for the convenience of office holders &ndash; is not a mechanism for regulation in this area. It will be kept up to date to reflect any changes in the statutory framework which may arise from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I have to refer again to my reply <Col N="59" /> in the House on this subject on 13 October last. I am satisfied that the issues relating to gifts are addressed comprehensively in the statutory framework and the steps to be taken in different circumstances are clearly specified. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, was a long time in preparation and strikes a fine balance between the right of individuals to have personal lives and the need for accountability in the conduct of official business. I regard the balance struck as appropriate. It would not be appropriate to provide alternative or parallel provisions in the Cabinet Handbook which would interfere with the balance so painstakingly established in the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Cabinet Handbook deals with this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, but not in the same detail as the Act. I have been advising my colleagues to follow the legislation because the Cabinet Handbook does not contain the detail which has to be complied with. The old rules of the Cabinet Handbook relied very much on precedent and practice. That is now set in statutory law. As queries have arisen the Public Office Commission has ruled on how that is to be interpreted. Members have to be conscious of what is in the legislation and their annual return rather than just following the Cabinet Handbook. I am not saying the Cabinet Handbook is irrelevant. However, people should not take it that their obligations are just what is in the Cabinet Handbook. They need to consult the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everybody is listening closely to what the Taoiseach has just said. However, is there not potential for confusion if the same subject is dealt with separately and in different words in two different sources of regulation, both of which apply to the same people in the same circumstances? Would he not, therefore, consider the possibility of simply removing these references from the Cabinet Handbook and relying solely on the legislation, which is more precise, to avoid any excuse of misinterpretation or any excuse for unfair accusation either?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty with that, and it should be done. However, every time a case arises, case law determines where we are and interprets sections of the Act, and people have to be very conscious of that. The old system had advantages but the law supersedes those. However, I take the point that the Cabinet Handbook should not be contradictory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 6 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties being experienced by the Chief State Solicitor's office at the moment, especially in recruiting and retaining staff, and the efforts being made to address those difficulties. I refer to my previous replies on this issue on 7 December, 1999 and 8 February last. Problems of recruiting and retaining staff are affecting many areas of the Civil Service and are more or less an inevitable consequence of the present economic boom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two major factors affecting recruitment and retention of professional and technical staff are the comparatively low starting salaries and a <Col N="61" /> perception that career prospects are not good. Many of the professional and technical staff recruited to permanent posts would already have some years experience in private firms. Others would have worked in the Chief State Solicitor's office on a contract basis. The current situation is that staff in the recruitment grades have been advanced to the next grade within a comparatively short period. This is unlikely to continue into the medium term given the age profile in the office.</P>
    <P>In my replies to supplementary questions on 8 February last I inadvertently referred to a salary scale of £31,000 to £39,000, which is the scale for Senior Assistant Solicitor, rather than that of the recruitment grade. The recruitment grade, Assistant Solicitor, scale ranges from £16,072 to £28,411. The actual starting point depends on qualifications and experience at date of entry. Most solicitors start above the minimum. A reference to a salary scale for clerical staff, intended to refer to the grade of law clerk, may have been misinterpreted as referring to general service clerical grades. For complete clarity I am circulating a copy of the salary scales for the relevant grades in the Official Report. I have received representations and am aware that the reference to the wrong scale caused some unease among the staff in the CSSO and I am now addressing this.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the recent industrial action in the CSSO. The action has now been suspended. Discussions are taking place between IMPACT and the Law Offices with the Department of Finance about the staffing, grade structures and starting salary arrangements for both the prosecution service and the CSSO. I hope these negotiations will result in agreed measures to address the current problems. I understand that there is progress in the discussions.</P>
    <P>I also referred to my previous replies indicating that steps have been taken to tackle the difficulties faced by the CSSO at the moment, such as the creation of additional posts, both in professional and technical promotion grades, and the proposal to establish a State claims agency that would reduce the burden on the CSSO by reducing the volume of litigation. The more general developmental and modernisation issues within the office have been addressed through measures to achieve the objectives in the office statement of strategy as required under the Public Services Management Act, 1997, and the consequential business planning process.</P>
    <P>There are currently 25 assistant solicitors in the CSSO; none has more than two years and eight months' permanent service in the office. In addition there are 22 solicitors employed on short-term contracts. Two vacancies will arise as a result of retirements over the next three years. One of these, the position of Chief State Solicitor, is being filled by an open competition which is under way at the moment. The second will arise at Assistant State Solicitor level and will be filled by a process involving the top level appointments committee. There may be consequential vacancies arising from these retirements.<Col N="62" /></P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for correcting the record and for eliminating some of the erroneous and damaging information that he, perhaps inadvertently, put on the record of the House on 8 February. However, it is not clear from the thrust of his reply if he accepts the thesis that given the shortage of professional staff across the economy, and the comparatively low levels of payment at junior and middle ranks both for professionally qualified staff and for technically qualified assistants, the Chief State Solicitor's Office will be incapable of servicing the needs of the State with the scale of expertise and professional experience it requires. Accordingly, does the Taoiseach not agree that the crisis facing the Government's legal services is not dissimilar to that which faced the financial services of the Government when the National Treasury Management Agency was established?</P>
      <P>In light of his corrected and better informed analysis of the situation, does he now have a view whether we should not change the status of the CSSO and enable it to operate with a degree of autonomy similar to that of the NTMA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been looked at a number of times. In fact, it has been looked at almost continually since 1996 when the Deloitte &amp; Touche report made certain recommendations. Those were implemented almost in full by the Attorney General of the day, bar one of the clauses which has still not been implemented. Further matters were considered by the law officers review group which has been implementing them. I recently answered questions in the House concerning the Nally review group whose recommendations are to change the structure whereby the criminal case sections would move to the DPP's office. Those legislatively based powers and functions will be answerable to the DPP's office, and a solicitor from that office would deal with the section. Those recommendations are being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am loath to go off at a tangent, there clearly are difficulties in obtaining professional <Col N="63" /> staff. While this is not a criticism of Deputy Quinn's question&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <P>It was taken out of it in the first place when I was in there, but it is not that simple. On a serious level, there are problems in this area. As I said the last day, the fundamental point is that people are still moving from that grade upwards. Having discussed the matter, people think that might not continue to occur to the level it currently does. The Department of Finance and the Attorney General have agreed on a fundamental review, involving IMPACT, to see how they can resolve the staffing and structures in this particular area to the best of their ability. Even with some improvement, it will still be difficult to get solicitors to stay in the system for a long period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and, while disregarding some of the more humorous aspects of it, I would ask him to consider three things. First, the volume of litigation against the State is at an unprecedented level, and is probably rising. Second, inefficiencies or lack of staff within the CSSO, as we all know through a number of different Administrations, are costing taxpayers a veritable fortune. Third, would the Taoiseach not agree that a proposal that originated in the previous Administration &ndash; which was not exactly strangled at birth but was at least starved of feed by the present Minister for Finance &ndash; to establish a claims agency&mdash;</P>

The reality is that we are facing an enormous amount of money which, if it was saved, would build the dream stadium to which the Taoiseach is so committed and which the rest of us would like to see. When will the Taoiseach do something about it? As Taoiseach he has the power. We could deal with this issue. The solicitors who are leaving the public service are not disappearing; they are going elsewhere in society. We are losing a veritable fortune in taxpayers' money because of collective incompetence in dealing with the problem at ministerial level, when we had the template in the past. As a result the taxpayers are paying out a fortune. The problem does not belong to one Administration but it happens to be occurring on the Taoiseach's watch. There are proposals for dealing with it and there is a precedent for doing so. The NTMA is not something that one would use to replace&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I never mentioned Leitrim County Council, wherever that came in, but the national claims agency is going ahead. It will be under the NTMA so that issue is being dealt with.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct and most of the contract staff are dealing with claims in one particular area. Hopefully that situation will resolve itself, but that is why there are contract workers. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report which was published at the end of 1996 was fully implemented in 1997 and in the first half of 1998. The Law Services Officer Review was implemented and the Nally review is being implemented. Every one of those reports has brought more technology, more staff and an increase in grades. Detailed discussions are going on to see what is needed to deal with the situation now. As Deputy Quinn knows, in good times, people who are in these grades &ndash; even the people who are in the first promotional grade &ndash; can command higher salaries after a period, and that is why they are moving on. Perhaps the second reason is that, because of the structure, they do not think there will be many senior positions for them later on.</P>

      <P>At present, IMPACT, the Department of Finance and the Office of the <Col N="65" /> Attorney General are painstakingly going through the grades and staffing structures to try to devise and improve the position for the third time in three years. The Deputy is correct in saying that the workload of litigation is increasing in all areas, but so is the size of the Chief State Solicitor's office, and so is the cost of the reforms, but that is a necessary part of it. The Deputy's suggestions have not been brought to my attention, although I have been asked by IMPACT and others to try to do other things.</P>

        <b>:</b> I am glad the Taoiseach has corrected the record of the House because his comments on the last occasion certainly inflamed passions within the CSSO. On the last occasion, the Taoiseach said people were being head hunted, but that is inaccurate. People are not being head hunted, they are actually leaving. The reasons they are leaving are threefold. First, there is a ridiculously low salary scale &ndash; an assistant temporary solicitor gets £13,670. There are secretaries getting more than solicitors with degrees and two years' apprenticeships and this should be tackled on that basis. Another problem is literally on the Taoiseach's left. The Department of Finance has steadfastly refused to appoint people on a permanent basis at that level. Unless that issue is tackled this matter will not be resolved. The third aspect is the impossible workload, where people are not only working their ordinary hours but must work until 8 or 9 p.m. and one day each weekend in the majority of cases due to the increase in workload. The Taoiseach gained something of a reputation as a Minister for Labour for mediating and resolving matters and he should use his good offices in this case.</P>

      <P>This problem has been going on for several years and each time a report has been done on it or the work has increased, people have moved on. The difficulty is being created by the fact that people are moving out of the system while the work is growing. Deputy Higgins said people are working late and on weekends. That is a regular feature of work in many Government Departments and State agencies all the time, so it is not a unique feature to this section.</P>
      <P>This issue has been addressed three or four times by successive Governments and I will make sure this attempt to resolve it is implemented, as I have done with the last two efforts. Approaches were agreed, but then people come up with more demands and the workload increases, so additional staff are required. We have tried to address that and I do not accept that there has been enormous movement in this area in recent years.</P>

Does he accept that there is no strategic management whatever in this institution but crisis management of a chronic kind ruling every day there? Does he agree that this problem needs to be taken by the scruff of the neck at political level and dealt with once and for all? I know the Taoiseach does not have the time to do it, but he should appoint one of his existing Ministers of State to deal with the issue of the legal services <Col N="67" /> of the State once and for all. He could give that Minister of State a timeframe of a year or two to solve the problem as well as giving him the financial and political authority to do so. The crossdepartmental approach of the strategic management initiative could be used and the Minister of State could be appointed to his Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, so that that one individual would have all the relevant files.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recently published inflation figures for Ireland &ndash; January 2000 &ndash; show a year-on-year increase of 4.0% in the consumer price index, CPI, and a 4.4% increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. The most recently published EU HICP was 1.7% for December; this compares with the December HICP figure of 3.9% for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The recent increase in the rate of inflation reflects a number of factors which include the fall in the value of the euro; the increase in crude oil prices which have added more than 1% to inflation; and the budget increase in excise duty on tobacco, which was introduced for health promotion purposes, and which has added about .75% to inflation.</P>
      <P>Excluding the increases in oil prices and excise duty, which do not reflect the underlying trend, inflation in January was closer to 2%. As the impact of these special factors passes through, it is expected that inflation will peak in the near future and should fall through the second half of this year. Concern about inflation substantially reflects concern about competitiveness. Since key factors behind the recent increase in inflation are temporary in nature, they should not lead to a disimprovement in our competitive position. However, this temporary increase in prices would be a matter for concern if it were to show signs of adding to wage inflation. The main policy response of this Government, therefore, has been to guard against such an outcome by ensuring that wage increases remain competitive.</P>
      <P>Towards this end, the Government has just completed negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000, aimed at ensuring that the consensus-based approach to managing our economic affairs, which has been so successful to date, will continue for another three years. The pay terms of the new agreement strike a balance between providing gains in real disposable incomes and maintaining the economy's competitiveness. Adherence to these pay terms will help ensure that the recent rise in inflation is temporary and that we can sustain economic and social progress. In supporting social partnership and sensible wages evolution, budgetary policy is also geared towards maintaining stability. Reducing taxes is an essential part of this process. The Government intends to continue with these successful income and budgetary policies as the best way to tackle inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enhancing competition is also important in <Col N="69" /> keeping inflation low and with that in mind the Government has been opening up markets to greater competition. The efficiency improvements and the higher productivity that has resulted from this process has put downward pressure on prices in certain sectors. The recent dramatic fall in telecommunications costs is an example of this. The Government is continuing to pursue these policies in those areas of the economy that could benefit from increased competition.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic that the recent increase in inflation will turn out to be temporary. I am confident that the continuation of the Government's wage, tax and market-reform policies is the best approach to achieving this objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put two points to the Minister. First, when the 50p increase on a packet of cigarettes impacted on the consumer price index by one quarter of 1%, would it not have been prudent of the Minister to reduce excise on petrol by an equivalent amount in order that the excise decisions in the budget would have neutralised each other? The Minister did not need the additional revenue and the considerations for increasing excise on tobacco were health related, not revenue related. The Minister should have taken other measures to cancel out the impact of the increase.</P>
      <P>Second, is the Minister aware that in other EU countries, particularly Belgium, where continuing increases in cigarette and tobacco costs form government policy, the cost of excise on these items has been removed from the basket of items which form the basis of the consumer price index and would he consider introducing a similar strategy here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy stated that the cigarette price increase impacted on the consumer price index by one quarter of 1% when it actually impacted by three quarters of 1%. The decision to increase the price of cigarettes was signalled well in advance by the Minister for Health and Children in May or June of last year and should not have come as any surprise in the budget. The Deputy asked why I did not consider reducing excise on petrol. An energy directive is currently being drafted in Europe and the Irish rates of excise on petrol and related products are currently far below the EU average. To reduce excise in this area would move us further away from probable increases which future Governments will be obliged to make. In terms of environmental concerns, Deputy Noonan's Green Party colleagues would have objected loudly had I reduced the price of petrol or oil products. All of these matters were borne in mind when I was making my budget decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the removal of tobacco prices from the CPI, the Deputy will recall that many years ago a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, removed mortgage interest from the CPI but found that nobody was prepared to accept the CPI unless <Col N="70" /> it included mortgage interest. People want these issues to be included in the index.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take arising from the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which found that there was scope for improvement in a number of areas in regard to the performance of the Central Bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General entitled Central Bank Financial Regulation, report no. 34 of December 1999. This report was submitted to me by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 18 January last and was published on the 2 February. I understand the next step would be for the Committee of Public Accounts to consider the report.</P>
      <P>This report was the outcome of a detailed examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the systems, procedures and practices employed by the Central Bank in the discharge of its role as the main regulator of the financial services sector in Ireland. The report was comprehensive and provided a clear and useful guide to the way in which the Central Bank carries out its function as a financial services regulator. Overall, the report notes that current international practice is followed by the Central Bank for prudential supervision.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank currently has responsibility for some 1,000 financial institutions and 2,000 collective investment schemes. The bank has a proven record in pursuing the mandate of prudential regulation, which is to ensure that individual financial institutions comply with a set of rules which are designed to ensure their continuing solvency and liquidity &ndash; prudential supervision; that risks to the financial system as a whole are minimised &ndash; systemic supervision; and that there is a degree of protection for depositors with credit institutions and for clients of investment firms &ndash; conduct of business supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulation in a dynamic, complex and evolving sector is a process which must be continually reviewed and brought up to date. The Central <Col N="71" /> Bank is very conscious of this requirement and it has welcomed this review of the process. The report puts forward some positive suggestions as to how the regulatory process could be enhanced and the Central Bank has indicated that it is fully prepared to take on board and implement the various suggestions for improvement contained in the report.</P>
    <P>Following examination of the report by the Committee of Public Accounts, the board of the bank will consider any recommendations of the committee. I would be prepared to consider any legislative changes that may be required to implement any of the recommendations in the report or the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I am familiar with the content of the report but I want to know the Minister's response to it. Is the Minister satisfied with the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusion that in spite of the fact that since 1989 external auditors have been required to report to the Central Bank any material defects in internal control or suspicions of impropriety, no such reports were received by the bank and the bank apparently did not pursue them? Is the Minister satisfied that the documentation of the risk profile of credit institutions could be improved upon and is he satisfied with various other recommendations contained in the report? If he is not satisfied with those recommendations, what does he propose to do about it? Does the Minister agree that this report makes it all the more urgent that the Government would act on its decision of October 1998 to set up a single regulatory authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not be confused about the role of this report. This was the type of normal review, such as a value-for-money audit, which is carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General on many institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time the Central Bank has been reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report does not make any findings in respect of financial institutions other than in respect of their dealings with the Central Bank. For example, the report specifies that external auditors of financial institutions should in future be required to furnish an annual report stating that they did not find any matters of concern rather than the situation which has pertained heretofore where auditors only reported to the bank if they found something wrong. No such reports of irregularities have ever been made to the Central Bank by external auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report will be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts which requested it in the first instance and the committee will comment on the report. The board of the Central Bank is also currently reviewing the report. If it transpires that <Col N="72" /> certain matters require to be addressed in terms of legislation, I will ensure that happens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that he does not have a view on the matter at this time. Exchange controls were one of the areas for which the bank was responsible. In November 1997, the Minister read a letter from the Governor of the Central Bank into the record in regard to the implementation of exchange control regulation arising out of the McCracken tribunal. The Minister referred the letter to the DPP and intimated that he would return to the House when he received the DPP's observations. To the best of my knowledge the Minister has not done that; perhaps he would inform us of the current position.</P>

I have also replied to a large number of questions on the matter put down by Deputy Noonan and other Deputies. I am fully conversant with the views of the Irish League of Credit Unions on taxation matters. No other Member knows these views better than I. The league will meet the Taoiseach tomorrow to explain its concerns. It would not add to my knowledge to meet the league again tomorrow.</P>

      <P>A number of factors will be taken into account in dealing with the report of the working group, a minority of whom recommended how this taxation matter should be dealt with. I said last week that an investigation of the existing status of the taxation arrangements applying to credit unions is taking place, without awarding further concessions. The motion adopted by the House in Private Members' time stated that when the investigation is complete, it will be taken into account by the Government in future taxation arrangements with the credit unions. As I also said last week, there are other questions regarding equity and all savers which must also be borne in mind in making special arrangements for particular financial institutions.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts which dealt extensively with the use of multiple accounts in financial institutions where there were exemption levels of interest, and given the problems with that, Members should be reluctant to advocate a new form of exemption for financial institutions.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Revenue Commissioners have been undertaking a look-back DIRT audit in relation to all financial institutions in the State. Such an audit was recommended by the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the operation of DIRT which was published in December 1999. I am also aware that the chairman of the Financial Services Industry Association has written to the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners expressing concerns at documentation compliance issues in relation to DIRT which may arise in the case of certain IFSC banks and at the possible need for inclusion of notes in the accounts of the parent companies dealing with the question of contingent liabilities. Similar issues arise in the case of the domestic banks. These are matters for the Revenue Commissioners who have arranged to meet the FSIA to discuss the issue.</P>

      <P>The Financial Services Industry Association wrote to me about this matter last week. I understand the same letter was sent to the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Taoiseach. I am aware of the problem. This is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who were given powers by the Finance <Col N="75" /> Act, 1999 and previous Acts, to deal with these matters. They have considerable discretion to deal with this matter under the care in management provisions of the Act. The FSIA will meet the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners later this week to discuss the matter further. It would be totally inappropriate for me to become involved with these issues at this stage. I am concerned about any damage done to the IFSC although as I said in my reply, this problem also relates to domestic banks. As Deputy Noonan will recall, there was considerable discussion of the roles of the Department of Finance and the Minister <i>vis-à-vis </i>the Revenue Commissioners. We should draw some lessons from this. I am satisfied that the proper course is being pursued. A meeting has been arranged between the FSIA and the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

The Revenue Commissioners are empowered by various Acts to enforce the law without fear or favour. They have discretion under care in management provisions to deal with these issues. That is what they are doing with these 37 financial institutions. Some difficulties have arisen and I understand a meeting is taking place this week between the Revenue Commissioners and the FSIA regarding the interpretation of the law.

It is intended to make the legislation as user-friendly as possible. There will, for example, be an improved appeals system.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the scheme in question was highly secretive and all relevant information is not readily available. Tax liabilities are being reviewed in conjunction with other inquiries and information is emerging from other sources. It is too early to say when the overall inquiry will be concluded or what the outcome will be. The inquiry is being handled in conjunction with other offshore inquiries by a team of officers set up to inquire into the so-called Ansbacher accounts. The Deputy will be aware that Revenue have substantial powers to counter tax evasion, particularly the powers given to them in last year's Finance Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the office of the Information Commissioner that there are currently a total of 444 reviews on hand, plus a further 83 applications for review which have not yet been accepted. There is normally a short delay in deciding whether an application for review is valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance recently sanctioned an increase from four to seven in the number of investigators in the office of the Information Commissioner. An additional executive officer post was also sanctioned. I am sure the House will agree that the role of the Information Commissioner in reviewing requests for access to records held by public bodies, under the Freedom <Col N="79" /> of Information Act, is of particular importance. While recent figures suggest that around 5% of the more than 15,000 FOI requests received by public bodies up to the end of 1999 have been referred to the Commissioner, these will, of their very nature, include some of the more complex and contentious cases. I expect the 75% increase in staffing at the investigator level will allow for a significant reduction in the backlog of cases on hands in the Information Commissioner's office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the average length of time in dealing with the review and the number of reviews which have been waiting for more than a year? Will he agree that where the release of information is delayed for that length of time, frequently the information will be of little or no relevance and that this type of delay makes a nonsense of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's latter point. One cannot give an average time because each case varies tremendously in the context of the material sought and whether a third party is involved. Approximately 51 cases have been delayed for more than a year which is quite small in the context of 15,000 cases. This compares well with any other jurisdiction. I hope there will be a double hit as a result of the increase in the numbers of staff. Given that this was a new Bill and a new way of doing business, so to speak, there was a learning curve involved during the early part of its implementation. Many case precedents were set over that period and we are now building up a certain number of precedents which will allow for a much quicker review of many cases in similar areas. There should be a dual benefit in the context of the extra staff and the experience gained in the past 12 months.</P>

There should be a two stage process involving fin<Col N="81" /> ancial institutions being given time to do everything in their power to contact the next of kin or the beneficiaries named in the accounts. It would only be after that procedure had been followed that an account would be deemed dormant and would be taken over by the State.

I have no information on what the figure might be regarding accounts which have been dormant for five or ten years. However, I am not convinced that the figure for 20 years is £15 million or lower. Nobody knows the exact amount and the only way it will be established is if legislation is introduced. My gut feeling is that the <Col N="82" /> amount is considerably higher but much will depend on how the types of dormant accounts are defined.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts recommended something along those lines. The sub-committee recommended that, as soon as feasible, legislation should be prepared by the Minister for Finance so that the resource represented by funds in dormant accounts may be used for specified purposes of societal and community benefit. There is a precedent in the Funds of Suitors provisions. The sub-committee recognised that this recommendation raises important considerations in terms of property rights and liquidity issues. It also recognised that the Minister for Finance should have discretion as to the timing and content of the proposal.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to correct an aspect of the sub-committee's recommendation regarding a precedent in the Fund of Suitors provision. It is not wholly appropriate to link the two matters because the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, did not purport to transfer the funds in question to the State. It authorised the use of funds already under the control of the accountant of the High Court for specific purposes of public good.</P>

In five or six years' time some Minister for Finance could say all the Irish financial institutions are owned by banks in Germany, Italy, etc. and ask how we allowed that happen and wonder if it was a good thing. I have thought for some time that we should do some thinking about all these aspects of the banking sector. The Irish banks are large in an Irish context but small in a European or worldwide context. Some of the issues referred to by the Deputy should be addressed at this stage and we and the banks should at least look at them. I hope the working group will report in the near future. We have received some submissions but are awaiting others. The report, which will be published, will allow for a wider debate. In this way we will all have full knowledge of the situation. As the Deputy said the share prices in some of the financial institutions have fallen for many reasons.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the two issues as exclusive. There are many reasons underlying the rationale for individualisation of the standard rate tax band. When we come to widen the standard rate tax band to the current rate of £28,000 it would then be appropriate to make some balancing adjustment to address the issue of stay-at-home spouses with children, carers and the handicapped. We thought about this matter before publishing the Fianna Fáil taxation proposals in 1997 where I advocated a standard rate tax band for stay-at-home spouses. As I have admitted, it was not my intention to bring forward the proposal in this year's Finance Bill because I believe that the differential in widening the band by £3,000 &ndash; from £14,000 to £17,000 &ndash; was not sufficient. However, due to the issues which arose immediately after the budget I decided to bring forward the proposal that I would have brought forward in next year's Finance Bill. I regard the two issues as separate. When my colleagues, my backroom team and I discussed the matter in 1997 we recognised the problem of the stay-at-home spouse and that if we did something on one side we would have to do something on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Our experience with this type of allowance is that in the first couple of years the take up is not usually as high as envisaged at the start. The rate of take-up of such schemes, together with the conditional nature of the allowance for certain two income couples who would also qualify for the extended standard rate band of up to £6,000, as provided for in section 3 of the Finance Bill, means that in all probability the original estimate of £125 million is still appropriate. Certain assumptions have to be made in regard to the take up of this allowance. It will be advertised fully in the next few weeks. The total estimated cost of the £3,000 standard rate allowance will be £125 million in the first full year.</P>

As I am on record as saying in this House, I appreciate the difficulties which people who suffer from some disability face in coping with everyday life. There are very many people with various forms of disability who would consider themselves as having a genuine case for the tax relief. Given the level of the benefits <Col N="88" /> available under the scheme, the cost is quite considerable and extending it further would present any Minister for Finance with some dilemmas. The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 5,400 and the cost to the Exchequer in 1999 was in the region of £17 million. The interdepartmental review group is trying to resolve the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The group has met on a number of occasions and will be arranging to meet with representatives of a number of organisations and with a number of persons who indicated a desire to make oral submissions. The date for such oral presentations has not yet been determined, but it is likely to be in the coming months. The information furnished at these meetings will facilitate the group in bringing its work to a conclusion and in finalising its report for consideration.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the review group of which he speaks has been sitting for almost two years? Does he accept that the medical criteria on which the scheme is based go back about 30 years and do not take into account many disabilities which we now consider to be serious but relate mainly to amputated limbs? Does the Minister accept that there is a very strong case for a graded mobility allowance which might not cost much more than the present scheme? This could take into account a person who is blind and would like to have a companion driver, a person who is mentally handicapped or the child of parents who cannot get about because they suffer from severe epilepsy. Such issues could be taken into account by a graded scheme. The present scheme is much too restrictive and quite unfair.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with this matter on a number of occasions and I have received representations from all sides of the House. The matter has also been discussed on a number of occasions at meetings of my own parliamentary party. Deputy O'Keeffe is correct in saying the review group has been meeting for some time. It is under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it is hoped that when it meets with other groups it will bring forward proposals.</P>
      <P>This scheme is very attractive and if it were opened too widely its cost would be enormous. It was introduced to target people who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility. The total number of beneficiaries of the scheme is approximately 5,400. The medical criteria were adjusted some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle tried to extend the scheme when he was Minister for Health and all hell broke loose. Those who already benefit from the scheme are very reluctant to see any tinkering with it. It is a difficult issue to resolve within cost limits. If such a scheme were being introduced now it would be done very differently and it is unlikely that tax reliefs would be granted. In other countries grants are given to disabled <Col N="89" /> drivers. However, those who enjoy tax reliefs under the present scheme do not wish to see it changed. That has presented difficulties to successive Ministers in trying to make changes.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that there are tens of thousands of people throughout the country who are severely disabled but who do not come within the strict terms of this scheme? These people see 5,400 people qualifying and, while they are glad to see them qualify, they feel marginalised and disadvantaged. In many cases they are unable to walk and have to be driven but do not qualify for the scheme. The Minister quoted a cost of £17 million. Much of that cost is expenditure which would not otherwise have occurred &ndash; cars would not have been purchased &ndash; were it not for the scheme. Will the Minister reach out to the thousands of people who need the scheme or something similar to it and give them some hope?</P>

Pressure would be applied to Deputies, perhaps during election campaigns, and Deputies know what would happen then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always useful when considering proposals such as those contained in the Bill to consider the historical context in which they arise. The Finance Bill is concerned with the raising and distribution of Government revenues. We fund the activities of Government principally by raising taxes and the concept of raising taxes is very ancient. The Crusades were funded by raising taxes. In this country, famine relief works were funded by raising taxes on a local basis. In Britain the First World War was funded by the introduction of a broad based tax on income and we have lived with taxes on income ever since. The building of such projects as Ardnacrusha power station and Shannon Airport and the development of new hospitals, not just recently but throughout the period since independence, the national road network, the education system, up to the provision of free second level education for all in the 1960s as well as new centres of third level education, are all powerful evidence, if it were needed, of the benefits that have accrued to the nation and its citizens from revenues raised by successive Governments. Taxation has also served to provide assistance for the weaker sections of society on a progressive basis.</P>
      <P>As time has passed one of the most important ways in which the taxation system has helped society has been through the provision of financial incentives for the encouragement of industry. The 1940s and 1950s were a period of high protectionism for native industry but the 1960s under Sean Lemass saw a change of direction in Government policy which helped to prepare the country for the rising tide of economic growth through successive programmes for economic expansion. The introduction of the Shannon free airport development zone, a 10% corporate tax rate for manufacturing industry and, more recently, the development of the International Financial Services Centre were all crucial to the modern economic miracle we have witnessed. It would be impossible not to recognise the part our membership of the European Union has played in this development but we should never overlook that we have much to be proud of in our own efforts in this regard. Through our taxation policy and education system we have produced an economy that is the envy of many other countries.</P>
      <P>The Bill is ample evidence of the success of the economic policies of Fianna Fáil in government. Since his appointment in 1997 the Minister for Finance has overseen serious reductions in the levels of personal income tax, capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax as well introducing a number of innovations in the pensions area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to income tax the enactment of the <Col N="92" /> Bill will see the standard and higher rates of tax reduced to their lowest levels since the foundation of the State. This must be viewed as a remarkable achievement. It is all the more notable when one considers the position that prevailed just over ten years ago. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday of this week stated:</P>
    <P>Today's booming economy is a vastly different creature to the battered economy of 1987. At that time, the public finances were in a shambles. Soaring inflation and interest rates, negative investment, a penal personal tax code, massive unemployment and widespread emigration had combined to bring the State to a virtual standstill.</P>
    <P>Tax incentives created the foundation on which our booming economy was founded. The reductions in income tax proposed in the Bill, combining as they do with the proposals in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will help to maintain growth in the economy on a steady course for the next few years. The Government is giving back to taxpayers the benefits that have accrued since we had to tighten our belts during the difficult years in the 1970s and 1980s. Fianna Fáil said that it would create the environment in which industry could flourish. We achieved that aim and now, I am happy to say, taxpayers are reaping the rewards for placing their trust in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>With regard to capital acquisitions tax the Minister announced in the budget major increases in the tax thresholds for inheritance tax and major reductions in the levels of tax by abolishing the multiple rates and introducing a level rate of tax of 20%. These changes have been confirmed in the Bill and will be a source of enormous relief for families. Improvements are to be made to the basis of aggregation. Previously, penal rates of tax applied to relatively small inheritances and frequently required the disposal of the inheritance to pay tax.</P>
    <P>Earlier I listened to what the Governor of the Central Bank had to say about the economy in the context of EMU. He made a number of salutary points which are worth noting. We have to be reasonably careful in managing the economy and if corrective action is not taken at some stage we could be in trouble. Deputy Yates said that we are not conscious that there may be another side to the boom and bloom economy, however, the Minister is well capable of tuning the economy to suit. In his address to the Joint Committee on European Affairs the Governor of the Central Bank said:</P>
    <P>Studies undertaken by the Central Bank suggest that, for the medium term, we have the capacity to sustain a growth rate of the order of 4% to 5%. This is about twice the estimated potential growth rate for most European economies. The exceptional growth over and above this for the past few years was made possible by a high degree of slack in the economy and in particular, by a rather low employment rate. <Col N="93" /> This good performance contributed to a welcome increase in living standards and employment. Now, however, there is mounting evidence of overheating in the domestic economy. This is reflected in exceptionally rapid increases in property prices, unprecedented demand for credit, labour shortages, higher inflation in the services sector and chronic congestion in the physical infrastructure.</P>
    <P>During the past year, there has been a marked disimprovement in our inflation performance, both in absolute terms and by reference to our main trading partners. In January, the rate of inflation here, as measured by the HICP, the benchmark index for euro area comparisons, was 4.4%. This was two and a half times the rate prevailing in the euro area as a whole. This puts us at the top of the league table. Some of the rise in headline inflation can be ascribed to once-off or temporary factors &ndash; such as the rise in excise duty on cigarettes, higher oil prices and weakness in the euro. There is, however, a strong rise in underlying inflation which for the most part reflects the existence of strong demand.</P>
    <P>Nobody claims that inflation here must be at precisely the same level as in the euro area generally. It is reasonable to expect some differential at this time in view of our economic conditions but there are obvious limits. The point I want to emphasise is that, if present trends persist, we may have a sharp loss of competitiveness on our hands.</P>
    <P>I was glad when the Minister came down heavily on tax evasion. The Committee of Public Accounts by way of the DIRT inquiry has done the country a remarkable service. It has been clearly stated that there will be no hiding place for tax evaders. I have no compunction in saying that tax evasion should be rooted out, whether by big business or multimillionaires. I represent a constituency where social welfare fraud on a small scale has nearly always been part of the culture. I am not trying to condone it, but often people had no option but to hide the fact that they had done some nixers when pursued by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, often for a couple of hundred pounds. It has been decided at long last and not before time that big tax defrauders should be pursued and I compliment the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>Child care was a big issue in the run-up to the budget. The £3,000 allowance for stay-at-home spouses who look after children, a handicapped person or an elderly person will equalise the position. It is welcome for that reason. The other initiatives taken on child care area are also welcome. The supply side has to be addressed. The provision under which there will be a 100% tax write-off of the costs incurred in providing new child care facilities and the refurbishment of existing centres is to be applauded. A number of interesting initiatives have been taken. There is a fine crèche facility in DCU which is funded in an innovative way. There is also a fine facility in <Col N="94" /> Coláiste Eanna in Cabra and another in Ballymun. Many more are needed.</P>
    <P>The provision relating to gifts to third level institutions is important. Increasingly, there will be a need for third level institutions to plug into the private sector. I am glad that the MIT will be funded to a certain extent through the Ryan Institute. The traditional and new universities have been lobbying for this for a long time. I hope when it moves to the Grangegorman site the Dublin Institute of Technology will benefit from income accrued in this way. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to offer the Minister a few suggestions. Section 13, which I welcome, but which does not go far enough, relates to rent relief on private rented accommodation. Due to a number of factors but in particular the failure at national level to build sufficient local authority houses throughout the country, there is a huge demand for rented accommodation. The vast majority of the tens of thousands of people who are on local authority housing lists are resident in private rented accommodation. Much of this accommodation is unfortunately in poor condition and most of the people in question are paying high rents.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a general 50% increase in the rent relief available; it is a 100% increase where the tenants are over 55. I welcome that in so far as it goes, but the Minister should try to avail of this opportunity to look at the important link between the tenant and the landlord. He must accept that rented accommodation will play a much more important role in the provision of housing than it did previously. The absence of proper legislation to support the tenant and the absence of sufficient tax relief in that regard are matters which could be looked at. I have often stated that the solution to the housing problem will not come solely from the Department of the Environment and Local Government or from simply building more houses. There is a need for a multifaceted response. The Minister must look closer at the question of rent relief for the tenant and put in place a firm foundation of security of tenure for the majority of tenants. I welcome the increase in the allowances but wish they would go further. The majority of tenants of whom I am aware, who are renting flats which are often in poor condition, are paying £80, £90 and £100 per week. The single person's rent tax allowance of £750 is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision for the urban renewal scheme and every local authority has been presenting towns to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for inclusion in <Col N="95" /> it. The previous tax relief schemes worked well and I am sure the new urban and village programme will also work quite well. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has received the submissions from the local authorities and I hope it will be able to reach an early conclusion on these applications because I know, from my own constituency, that the various interest groups in the towns in question would be interested to start work at the earliest possible date. I welcome the provision which allows these tax reliefs to enter the legal framework and I look forward to those towns benefiting from the scheme as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Most contributors to the budget debate referred to the surprise big news story of the Minister's Budget Statement, namely the policy of individualisation. The £3,000 allowance being introduced in the Bill by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is an attempt to solve a problem which he himself brought about. The genie has got out of the bottle and it is impossible to get it back in. As one looks at the list of categories which will not qualify for the £3,000 tax allowance, one will see further anomalies. If the Minister feels he has solved the problem by providing this allowance, while I concede he has taken a step in the right direction he will not solve all of the problems which his change of policy has brought about. When Deputies come across the many people in the constituencies who deserve this allowance but who are written out of it as the section stands, they will be back here to revisit this problem with the Minister in next year's Bill. I warn him that if he feels he has solved the problem, he has much ground to make up yet.</P>
    <P>On the matter which was discussed on Question Time, namely the disabled drivers tax concession, which we did not have time to tease out properly, the Minister for Finance stated that a review group is looking at the problem. Since I came into Leinster House, a review group seems to have been looking at this scheme. On Question Time the Minister informed the House that 5,400 persons qualify for the various concessions under that scheme and he does not want to widen the net too much. &ldquo;Shame on him&rdquo;, would be my response. This is one of the wealthiest economies in the world. We are not talking about giving grants to people, but about allowing special tax exemptions for a marginalised disadvantaged group of people. The review group is working against the backdrop of the Minister saying &ldquo;keep the budget strings tight&rdquo;. This is one area of fiscal policy where I would like to see the Minister being a little more generous. I hope he will demand of the review group that it will report quickly, generously and favourably to the many thousands of people, who are dependent on driving or being driven, to give them some degree of dignity. It is a shame that in a wealthy country the Minister cannot put in place a scheme of generous tax concessions for people who are genuinely disabled. Deputies will be aware of people <Col N="96" /> who are genuinely disabled but fall outside the remit of the disabled drivers tax concession scheme. I want to see that scheme changed to make life a little less miserable for many people who are severely disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Tourism is the fastest growing sector of the economy. While the numbers from the Continent have weakened in the past year, they still provide a substantial element of the income within the tourism industry. Many tourists hire cars to travel around the country and visit some of the more popular destinations. The majority of them come from countries where people drive on the right hand side of the road. Approximately one million tourists from North America and mainland Europe use cars to travel around Ireland. They find driving on the left disorientating. Add to this the poor quality of the roads compared to those in their countries and there is a cocktail for disaster.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 10% of road traffic accidents involve a foreign driver. The Insurance Federation claims that between 10% and 15% of accidents involving hired cars are as a result of tourists driving on the right hand side of the road. However, the car hire industry, with a fleet of approximately 25,000 cars on the roads, has failed to introduce an effective warning system for foreign drivers and has been intransigent in implementing new systems.</P>
      <P>There is an electronic system, which has been developed in Ireland, which would dramatically improve the awareness of foreign drivers of the requirement to drive on the left, but without the obligation to install such a system it will continue to gather dust. The car hire industry would be agreeable to the introduction of a system if it was tied to the cost of motor tax. The industry feels that the current motor tax system is crippling the further development of the sector.</P>
      <P>A scheme could be introduced in the Bill whereby a hired car with such a system installed would be entitled to a reduced level of car tax. This would be a small price to pay to save lives given that road fatalities cost £785,200 each. Will the Minister for Finance pass on the matter to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and examine the issue on Committee Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to the provision in the Bill which relates to DIRT and tax evasion, tax evasion was rampant during the 1980s and 1990s when the country was on its knees and Governments had to cut back on services, especially within the health service. The recent investigations focused on the roles of banks and building societies, but tax evasion measures were practised by investment advisers, financial consultants and insurance brokers also. They were facilitating people to hide funds from Revenue, social welfare, the health boards, etc. They too were involved in the establishment of bogus non-resident accounts. They, along with others, manipulated special savings accounts, which had a cap of £50,000, by establishing accounts with a number of financial insti<Col N="97" /> tutions. Financial advisers were also involved in the establishment of falsely named accounts for clients to cover up money from Revenue. This was endemic within the system until the criminal justice money laundering Act came into force in 1995. A person had to have photo identification and a recent household bill to open a new bank account. However, ways were quickly found around such requirements. When genuine clients provided data to satisfy the Act, their identification and bills were photocopied several times so that when another individual wanted to open a false named account, it would be opened with a different financial institution using the genuine clients' name furnishing the previously copied information. To prevent the initial client discovering such an account, the bank in question would be contacted a couple of weeks later to instruct it to change the address and route all correspondence through the broker. Identity documentation for motor insurance clients also facilitated the establishment of such accounts.</P>
    <P>While many of these brokers have since folded due to the negative investment returns, these key players in the multi-million pound tax evasion scam will never be known. Unless we are aware of these facts, we cannot ensure that such scams will not be repeated in the future.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give assurances that Revenue now has the powers under this Bill and other legislation to ensure this type of evasion cannot manifest itself again? Can he assure the House that we no longer have such loopholes in the money laundering Act? Can he guarantee that scams involving special savings accounts and false named accounts are not being used to establish savings accounts with An Post? Without such assurances in an economy flush with money, can we really say that such tax evasion is confined to the history books?</P>
    <P>Communities along the River Shannon are outraged that the Minister has refused to compensate farmers for fodder lost in the extensive flooding which occurred in December last and in January of this year. Many householders and rural dwellers also suffered losses and should be paid compensation. The refusal by this Government to pay any compensation has caused considerable anger among the community which has, through no fault of its own, again incurred extensive losses of fodder and damage to its property and homes. The number of people seeking compensation is relatively small but some have experienced substantial losses. The home of one family has been completely destroyed and repairs will cost in excess of £35,000 &ndash; the home is without any insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Each year we see flooding in the Shannon basin &ndash; no one is amazed by that &ndash; but what we are talking about is the extent of the flooding this winter, not only over the Christmas period but last September as well when many farmers lost fodder. There is no case of flooding in the Shannon basin in the history of this State in which the State did not compensate farmers and house<Col N="98" /> holders until now. This Government has decided these people are not entitled to compensation. I commend the Government on the funding it is providing to Third World countries suffering flooding but it is not willing to compensate people here. There is an old phrase which says charity begins at home but, sadly, this Government has neglected it. It is willing to compensate those abroad who, I am sure, badly need such compensation and funding but people in the same situation in this country are not deemed eligible for funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has turned his back on these people. It is the first time in the history of the State that a Government has turned its back on those communities along the River Shannon which have experienced flooding because of neglect over the years by Governments which were not willing to put proper maintenance measures in place for the River Shannon. I will have another opportunity to raise these and other matters on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This budget was the most commented upon one in a long time because it was the subject of series of U-turns. In regard to the individualisation aspect of the taxation proposals in the budget, it was claimed at the time that it was very socially divisive. We witnessed the interesting spectacle, which I have never seen in ten years in the House, where the Minister's party colleagues went out to the plinth to publicly criticise the budget in terms of how it impacted on stay-at-home wives.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to a comment made by the Taoiseach the following Sunday to Gerald Barry. When he was asked to comment on this, he said he was not aware of what was happening on the day as he had many other commitments to which he had to attend. It amused and astounded me given that one of the people leading the crusade at the time was his brother, Deputy Noel Ahern. I found it hard to understand how the Taoiseach could say he was not aware of what was happening because everybody else knew it was an orchestrated campaign.</P>
      <P>As a result of that type of pressure and the fact Fianna Fáil Deputies wanted to outflank the Independents on this issue, we have the £3,000 stay at home allowance. A previous speaker remarked that this £3,000 stay at home allowance will give rise to many anomalies and I agree because it is restrictive in regard to whom it applies.</P>

    <P>I attended a meeting in Limerick last Monday night organised by the mid-western private nursing homes association. I estimate that about 400 people attended that meeting. The main criticism related to subvention and the cost to people using private nursing homes. Nursing home subvention has remained static since its introduction in the early 1990s and the consumer price index has not been factored in. As a result, many people are under severe financial pressure. What happens if the wife of a person who works is in a nursing <Col N="99" /> home? That £3,000 allowance will not apply in that case which is an example of the type of injustice which can arise.</P>
    <P>It has been prophesied that the budget, and the subsequent budgets, if we could call them that, will cause inflation to spiral. Inflation is of concern to people. An increase of 7p per gallon of petrol has been earmarked. In the context of the tax hike the Government will take from petrol, is there merit in trying to keep inflation low by picking up something from the taxation element in regard to the 7p increase in the price of a gallon of petrol and offsetting it against what is happening at present? There is probably merit in that because people are concerned that what one gives with one hand, one takes it away with the other. It is not like smoking cigarettes because that is a choice people make. We accept that the funding which will come from the increase in cigarette prices will go to the heath budget. It is, however, an economic necessity to run a car in many areas.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy from a rural constituency will know that the big issue is low pay. Many companies in my area pay £10,000 per year to workers and quite often that is achieved through overtime. SIPTU, in its criticism of the budget, was very wise to focus on low paid workers. There has been an attempt to try to resolve that situation but not enough has been done. It is regrettable that the Government did not take on board a proposal made by my colleague, Deputy Noonan, to take low paid workers out of the tax net. At the time Government commentators rubbished his proposal but it is interesting to note that proposal is embodied in the Programme for Fairness and Prosperity. There is a degree of acceptance of what he said at the time.</P>
    <P>Low paid workers earning less than £10,00 per annum in my constituency and in other constituencies, with whom we all empathise, should not pay any tax. With regard to the budget, there are concerns about low paid workers. I respect the way the unions took up the cudgels on their behalf to fight to improve their position.</P>
    <P>We had the budget, then the social welfare changes and then the money earmarked for the stay at home wives. By dealing with these competing sources, the Government hoped to allay people's concerns, but many anomalies will be created as a result. The approximately 250,000 carers are not satisfied with what was provided for them in the budget. It did not address their needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill. In the short time available I will confine my comments to specific aspects of it. Unlike other speakers, I will not dwell unduly on the much discussed individualisation of bands and on the subsequent decision to introduce a tax allowance for the stay at home spouse caring for a child or an elderly relative. I wish to comment on child care which was at the centre of that debate. Despite the vast amounts of money com<Col N="100" /> mitted one way or another in the budget or directly afterwards, the child care issue remains unresolved with none of the interests involved satisfied that they have not been disadvantaged relative to other groups. The issue of child care must be addressed not only for economic or social reasons but in the interest of children in a changing society. How we care for children and how they are brought up are issues that must addressed, and the sooner the better.</P>
      <P>There is a solution which would be equitable and cost effective if the political will exists to provide it. It would require some money and the co-operation of the Ministers for Finance and Education and Science. I propose that primary school sites should be the focus of child care, that they should provide child care venues and that the State's only financial outlay would be the provision of the site and the capital cost of construction or refurbishment of under-utilised classrooms which exist in many schools. Such a facility would be provided locally by local voluntary of community groups, perhaps franchised to them and run thereafter on a commercial basis. The only State subsidy would be the initial capital cost. This would make child care affordable or at least more affordable and locally accessible.</P>
      <P>The are many advantages to this method of addressing child care. A site for such a facility is available in every parish. Children would be cared for in their own communities with their brothers, sisters and peers. It would alleviate the need for parents to drive their children of different ages to and from venues around the city throughout the day, which puts enormous stress on families. It would be available to all parents, whether married or single, in the workforce or at home. It would be up to each local community to decide whether there should be cross-subsidisation from those who are at work to those who want to get training to return to the workforce or who want to undertake any form of training. It would have the important economic advantage that it would be a once off commitment on behalf of the State at a time when there is money to invest in infrastructure. We may not always have money to make large cash payments directly to parents. If we put in place the infrastructure now, we will have achieved something. The principle of funding capital expenditure exists in the capital allowances that are provided to commercial operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to deal with the issue of carers of disabled persons. I welcome the changes introduced in the budget, but the major issue of people's access to the carer's allowance has again been left unresolved. To qualify for a carer's allowance one must be practically destitute. Those who qualify are merely switching from one form of State payment to another in which case there is no substantial improvement in the carer's income. It is almost impossible to find a person other than a recipient of State income who qualifies for the carer's allowance. To qualify for it, one must have no income and virtually no visible <Col N="101" /> means of support. This scheme appears to be geared at people who drop out the sky from another planet to take up a caring role.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to make this allowance more accessible by increasing the income disregard to make it more than a mere subsistence payment and to ease the burden of the extra costs, which are seldom recognised, involved in caring. Higher heating costs are incurred, not because disabled people need a higher level of heat than the rest of us, but because they and their carers are in the house literally 24 hours a day. There are all sorts of hidden costs involved of which many people may not be aware.</P>
    <P>I would go further and suggest that a flat payment, however small to begin with, should be paid to all full-time carers regardless of their income, in recognition of the enormous contribution and sacrifice they make on behalf of all of us. It is seldom recognised that carers put their lives on hold when they take on the care of a relative. This may be for only a few years in the case of an elderly relative, but in other cases it can be a lifetime commitment. That is an enormous sacrifice for a person to make and the State should recognise this by providing adequate payment for those concerned.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the significantly increased allocation to services for the mentally handicapped, which is long overdue but very welcome. I hope it will make significant inroads in the current year into providing residential, day care and respite services. I hope it will be sustained in the coming years so that waiting lists will become a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister has not yet espoused fiscal incentives for environmental improvements. One measure in the budget sought to restrict excise duty rebate to bus operators using low sulphur diesel. This was a purely cosmetic exercise because, to the best of my knowledge, there are no buses using anything other than low sulphur diesel. Irrespective of whether diesel is low sulphur, it is a filthy fuel and is one of the major pollutants in Dublin. With the new fleet of buses to be funded under the national development plan that are about to come onto our streets and spew out toxic fumes, it was a missed opportunity to at least not begin the process of a move to cleaner fuels. This is an issue on which we can bury our heads in the sand only for a limited period. I am sure the Minister is aware we have already exceeded the 2010 limit on greenhouse gas emissions, to which we signed up to in Kyoto. If we do not start now, through incentives, to clean up our air, it will be forced on us eventually in the form of environmental taxes, which will not be only unpopular but will damage our competitive position.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, the purpose of which is to give legal effect to the budget announced in early December and various measures announced in the intervening period, which no doubt will be discussed during this debate and on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This is the third of the five budgets planned by the Government and it sets us on the road to enhanced prosperity and fairness for all our people. A number of Members opposite concentrated on the announcements made since budget day, which are included in the Bill. I have been in the House only two and half years and have seen two previous budgets. I am also fortunate to be a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which will be dealing with this Bill on Committee Stage for three days next week. My limited experience here has been that we always get a statement from the Minister on budget day and, some weeks after, a press release outlining further details of what it is proposed to include in the Finance Bill. Last year the Finance Bill included a number of new features. On Second Stage in the Dáil, there were more new announcements and, right through Committee Stage, the Minister was happy to deal with amendments and, in some cases, bring forward amendments on Committee Stage and right up to Report Stage.</P>
      <P>There is a misconception on the other side of the House that what is announced on budget day is all that can be in the Finance Act when it is ultimately passed. That is not the case. It has never been the case and I do not expect it ever will be the case. The Finance Bill is an evolving process. Not only does it evolve from budget day until it is finalised by the Houses of the Oireachtas, but in respect of matters that are not dealt with during the detailed debate on Committee Stage this year, the Minister is happy to take on board suggestions for inclusions in next year's Finance Bill. In that regard the budget process is always ongoing. The shutters are not just drawn down when one budget is finalised. Life moves on and provisions in the Finance Bill move to take account of an evolving situation.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the announcements that have been made since budget day which have improved the Finance Bill. I have no problem with the Minister coming into the committee next week with further amendments to further enhance the Bill, and I hope they will get the support of all sides of this House if they are for the betterment of the people we are here to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget provides for £1 billion in personal income tax reductions on top of the £1 billion already delivered by the Government in its previous two budgets. It will remove 70,000 people from the tax net, including 10,000 people over the age of 65. That is a very important development, Last year a married couple could earn £13,000 before they came into the tax net. That figure will now be increased to £15,000. That is a tremen<Col N="103" /> dous weight off the shoulders of old people who, at that stage of life, worry about tax and about their financial liabilities and like to have their affairs in order. It is a welcome development that an additional 10,000 people over 65 are being taken out of the tax net. Elderly people in my constituency are particularly pleased with that aspect of this budget.</P>
    <P>This budget takes 125,000 taxpayers off the top rate of tax by substantially widening the standard tax band for single taxpayers and two income married couples. The top tax rate has been reduced by 2% and the lower tax rate has also been reduced by 2%. That is a phenomenal improvement on where we were a decade ago when tax rates were over 60%. This is how to fuel economic development, thereby increase employment, and make it worthwhile for people to work.</P>
    <P>The increase in the basic allowance for a single person is up by £500 and by £1,000 for a married couple. These increases are to be welcomed. On capital acquisitions tax, I am very pleased with the exemption of the shared family home from capital acquisitions tax for all those sharing the home, irrespective of the circumstances of their family relationship. The measure also cuts capital acquisitions tax to 20%, simplifying it in comparison with the three band structure we had up to now of 20%, 30% and 40%. We are also increasing the threshold for payment of capital acquisitions tax by substantial amounts so that no tax will now be payable on gifts or inheritances below £3,000 which are taken from a parent. I am very happy with those aspects.</P>
    <P>This budget encompasses the recently negotiated Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. That is how we have operated in recent years, and it is the principal reason for our economic success. Given that economic success, it is important that we now change our economic agenda to ensure that everybody shares in the benefits of the improved economy. I am pleased to see the Government's emphasis on the issue of social inclusion because, when the economy is doing well, it is incumbent on the Government to pay particular attention to that area.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that the national economic factors which underpin this budget are very strong indeed. I can understand why some commentators from outside the country might be slightly critical. I share the Minister's view that they do not fully understand the model of social partnership we have here. It is far more sophisticated and more inclusive than exists in most other countries. Members of this House have complained in the past that, effectively, many of the major decisions on pay, prosperity, income and taxation policy are being handed over by Government to the social partners for discussion and ultimately decision outside this Chamber, that the Government is handing over power that is within its own remit to the social partners. Other people may not agree, but I think that is a good thing. Being in Government is not just <Col N="104" /> about the exercise of power. The Government has power, but it gets far better results by not using it aggressively and by having people working with it. I would not like to see Governments having to vote pay increases for public sector workers through this Chamber on a year by year basis hoping that would run right through the entire economy. That would lead to confrontation in the House and outside it. That is why I am happy to see what I call sensible Government which includes sharing power and responsibility. It is a philosophy that I adhere to.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to only a couple of sections in detail now. Being a member of the Committee on Finance and the Public Sector, I will be happy to go into more detail on other aspects of it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 12 gives effect to the £3,000 carer's allowance announced by the Government on 8 December for spouses caring for children, the incapacitated and the aged. It is very important that that allowance is available only to people who are caring for or looking after people. It is not available to a spouse who is at home and not doing work of that nature. Some people may not like that, but I think it is justified. We must give a special carer's allowance to people who are caring for other people, be they younger or older people. The section spells out how this allowance will apply in detail. To ensure the allowance works as smoothly as possible, it is proposed to allow for an income disregard where the caring spouse has a limited amount of income of their own, for example, through part-time work. It is also proposed that the allowance will be available where an aged or incapacitated relative resides in the caring spouse's home or is being cared for close by. The allowance can also be retained for one year after the spouse returns to full-time employment. This, and the tapered withdrawal of the allowance when the spouse's income exceeds the income disregard, is designed to ensure that the allowance is not suddenly lost when the family circumstances change. The Minister has indicated that we will discuss that in further detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with that section. When the Minister announced it, I immediately spotted a potential difficulty which would arise unless there was an income disregard for people where, for example, the husband is on or below the average industrial wage and they are not well off and the wife has had to go out to the local shop, supermarket or hotel to do some additional work. They earn an extra £50, £60, £70 or £80 per week. The announcement as originally made on the first day might have given the impression that once that spouse was working outside the house they could not qualify for the carer's allowance. It would have been most unjust if that had been the case without the income disregard. A person can now earn up to approximately £80 per week and still retain the full £3,000 income tax carer's allowance. I am also pleased that there is a tapering relief so that a person on overtime may on <Col N="105" /> occasion go marginally over that rate. It would be very severe if there was to be a loss of the £3,000 carer's allowance as a result. The Minister has introduced a well measured detail in this case, but I will be pressing him to increase the disregard to well over £100 for future years. While it is not much at £80, it is a major step in the right direction and I will be seeking further advances on that sum at a later date.</P>
    <P>Section 38 extends the qualifying period for the urban and rural schemes until 31 December 2002. It also increases the capital allowance in respect of qualifying commercial buildings to 100%. The year one allowance of 50% will apply both to owner-occupiers and lessors. There has been some controversy about this legislation in the past year and, due to the European Commission's ruling, the double rent and rates relief will not apply to such schemes. I can understand that because the rent and rates relief was an operating subsidy as opposed to a capital subsidy. It was giving businesses in those areas an unfair operating advantage over business outside the designated area. It is not unreasonable that the European Commission should have ruled in that manner and I acknowledge that a change is taking place.</P>
    <P>I am particularly happy about this because four areas in Portlaoise town are specifically covered by the scheme having been submitted by Laois County Council for inclusion. The four areas are in the ownership of the local authority. In the nature of things, local authorities go about their business slowly. In only one of the schemes has the council entered a public-private partnership for the development of a housing scheme and a new private medical care centre in what was an old hospital. It has taken quite a bit of time to get this far on the first site and there are three remaining ones. I am glad this extension has been introduced because it will allow major developments to take place on the other three sites owned by the local authority. It should be taken into account that these incentives are not strictly for owners of private property. A sensible local authority can use them for the benefit of the local community through a process of public and private partnership.</P>
    <P>Section 72 deals with the new town renewal scheme which is close to my heart. We discussed this matter in detail on Committee Stage in last year's Finance Bill. Over the last decade smaller towns have suffered enormously while major cities and county towns have benefited from the designated areas scheme. People who had money to invest found it beneficial to take their money out of smaller rural towns and invest instead in designated sites in major county towns. Smaller towns became further run down as a result. Laois County Council has submitted a plan for Mountrath, Rathdowney, Mountmellick and Portarlington for inclusion in the new scheme which will commence at the beginning of the new tax year and will run to 31 March 2003. More than any other single measure, the scheme will help to revitalise smaller rural towns, including the four <Col N="106" /> in County Laois. Similar small towns ranging in population from 600 to 3,000 will get a new lease of life as a direct result of section 72. In such small towns the section will go down in history as a contributory factor that enabled them to turn the corner and restore prosperity to areas that had been deteriorating for years. I look forward to teasing out the details on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider introducing an environmental tax incentive for companies that recycle waste oil. One or two companies undertake the dirty job of collecting used oil from lorries, tractors, garages and filling stations. Rather than incinerating such oil, such companies have made a proposal to the Department of Finance to recycle oil for use as clean fuel. However, they will require tax incentives to facilitate such recycling. The proposal has not been included in the Bill but I will ask the Minister to insert it on Committee Stage. If that cannot be done I will ask him to include it in next year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good time to be in Government and probably a good time to be a Minsiter for Finance. The economy is going well and while the Minister cannot claim all the credit for that, if things were going badly he would get some of the blame. Therefore, it is probably reasonable and just to give him some of the credit. Falling unemployment figures, the number of new jobs created in the last couple of years, the growth in the economy generally and the state of the nation's finances mean that everything is going very well.</P>
      <P>The budget was formulated against that background and contains much that is good. The fuss over the individualisation issue in which many of us took part, took many eyes off the ball. We all went off chasing one particular issue while ignoring many of the good elements in the budget under financial affairs and other ministerial briefs. This debate gives us an opportunity to recognise some of the things that were overlooked. One billion pounds in tax reductions is an enormous figure which only a few years ago people would have regarded as funny money. One must recognise that the same amount, if not more, has been delivered in tax reductions over the previous two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When things are going well expectations go through the roof. Some people say their situation will only improve by about £15 per week, yet a couple of years ago if they improved their situation by 15p a week they would have been eternally grateful even to achieve that and survive with their shirts still on their backs. Expectations have risen enormously, however, and in that context one expects the Opposition to be demanding everything. That is partly their job but a sense of fair play has gone out the window. I would like to quote from a leaflet which my Labour Party constituency colleague delivered. It is a personal letter from Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the Leader of the Labour Party, and while I would not agree <Col N="107" /> with his views, in politics we are entitled to comment and to up the ante. The letter states:</P>
    <P>People in receipt of social welfare benefits have been treated just as shabbily. Old age pensioners received an increase of £7 per week. Everyone else is expected to put up with an increase of £4 a week. Given the resources available to the Government these are miserable increases.</P>
    <P>Blah, blah, blah. One can say that but it is a joke really, particularly when one realises what Deputy Quinn did for the old age pensioners when he was Minister for Finance. He gave them £3 one year, £2.20 the next and the princely sum of £1.80 another year. The letter is scandalously wrong. I am making a differentiation between comment and untruths, or whatever the parliamentary term is for that. It continues:</P>
    <P>High earners have done well out of this budget. Those struggling on low incomes have practically been ignored. For instance, a family with two children earning £10,000 per year receives an extra £2.15 per week under this budget.</P>
    <P>That is an absolute lie; it is scandalously wrong. He probably means the benefits they would get from taxation, but he totally ignores the £7 increase from family income supplement and the £4 increase from child benefit. I picked those two statements: one of which is a matter of opinion with which I disagree, but the other is just scandalously wrong. To score political points is one thing, but if one is stating something as fact one must have some standards. This is a personal letter from Deputy Quinn. He states that a family with two children on an income of £10,000 receives £2.15 per week according to this budget. They do not. They receive £13.15 per week, so there is a big difference. His assertion is scandalously unfair.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of this budget's treatment of the low paid. I have heard Ministers for Finance talk about taking thousands out of the tax net since I became a Member of Dáil Éireann and before, but we know that 95% of them went back into the tax net the following week. There is a great deal of hypocrisy. This year the improvement for the low paid was not enormous &ndash; they could earn £110 instead of £100 per week before paying tax. However, that follows a substantial increase last year, when the threshold jumped from approximately £70 to £100. One thing we can say about the Minister for Finance is that he keeps emphasising that he wants us to look at his budgets in totality rather than at any one in isolation. He does not play it safe. From looking at his three budgets one could say he goes in a certain direction and rectifies a certain wrong each year. He does not play it safe by giving tuppence to one and tuppence farthing to another and, in his view, is rectifying matters. That has long-term value, but in the short-term it can seem out of <Col N="108" /> synchronisation. He is making significant changes to the whole structure.</P>
    <P>Much has been done for the low paid in his three budgets. In addition, minimum wage legislation and the new national agreement are coming in. Many people spoke about minimum wage legislation for years but did nothing about it. Then, when the minimum wage was set at £4.40 per hour, unions ran out and spent a fortune on campaigns to raise it to £5. Where were they before the Government agreed to bring in minimum wage legislation? Much of this is hypocrisy where people do nothing but shout and roar to try to add 5% or 10 % to a total in order to make themselves look innovative.</P>
    <P>This is the era of social partnership and there is no doubt that the country has done well out of social partnership for the past 12 to 13 years. However, although I was concerned I am somewhat reassured by Deputy Cullen's remarks today, which shows the House still has some relevance. He said:</P>
    <P>The imposition and levying of taxation is the prerogative of the House. That is the reason we have the Money Bill mechanism to ensure legislative decisions on such matters can only be taken in this Chamber. It is only right, therefore, that the House should take particular interest in the taxation initiatives in the programme.</P>
    <P>It is reassuring that the House has some relevance. I was worried that although social partnership is fine, it might be going too far. We should be careful or we will become irrelevant. We must constantly involve ourselves and make ourselves more relevant or the action will take place in partnership discussions. I was in Finland before Christmas when its Parliament was going through its budget. The announcement by the Minister there seemed to come in the last week of a four or five week process rather than at the start of that process. They seemed to have many discussions on estimates, budgets and other matters which led to suggestions the Minister and various Departments took on board, but the budget, Finance Bill and debates took place in the last three days. That was a summary of what had happened for the previous few weeks. We seem to do it the other way around here. There are secretive talks for months in the Department of Finance and then the Minister comes into the Chamber and throws things at us that we have not previously heard of and that even his ministerial colleagues have only been informed of that morning. We then spend weeks afterwards talking about the event. We must watch out or we will become irrelevant. Looking at the Finnish example, we should reform ourselves. Much of the talk in the budget debate or on various Stages of the Finance Bill should come first and the budget should come afterwards. We have much to learn.</P>
    <P>People use that fantastic word, &ldquo;reform&rdquo;, about taxation, but everyone has a different <Col N="109" /> meaning for it. I see nothing wrong with our income tax system except that one pays tax too soon and at the high rate too soon. I was concerned by the individualisation suggestion, though I am happy with the way it has panned out now with the £3,000 allowance. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, said this morning:</P>
    <P>I am pleased our vision for reforming the tax structure has been endorsed by the social partners in the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We are all agreed that our taxation system will be further developed to deliver tax reductions in a fair, targeted and equitable way.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that the social partners endorsed the drift towards individualisation, but I am concerned by that and by us becoming irrelevant. The social partners include Community Action Network, Community Workers' Co-op, Conference of Religious of Ireland, European Anti-Poverty Network, Focus Ireland, Gay and Lesbian Network, Irish Association of Older People, National Adult Literacy Agency, Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas and so on. They are happy with the drift towards individualisation, which is interesting, but I would rather listen to my colleagues on all sides of the House. I do not know who some of those organisations represent &ndash; not many. Many of them are funded by various Ministers, but I do not know who they represent. Many are set up just to represent themselves. Many Members were concerned with individualisation and I would much rather listen to a cross-section of Deputies who, for good or bad, have some sort of mandate and who represent those who have elected us. I am concerned that too much emphasis is being shifted away from the Dáil just because that motley crew has endorsed this &ndash; I wonder if they discussed it. The fact that it is in the partnership deal and makes them happy does not make me happy. It is a matter for debate among public representatives who have been elected by the people.</P>
    <P>The budget debate went off the rails to discuss how we look after our children, but neither the budget or the Minister for Finance is responsible for looking after our social structure. I am glad of the £3,000 allowance and of the changes being brought forward. Many women are now working, and I see where the Minister is coming from. North Kildare is not typical of my constituency where middle class pockets comprise elderly and settled people. There is a great deal of good in this budget and we must recognise that. I hope that we, as elected representatives, continue to make this House relevant and discuss issues within this House rather than outside it.</P>

      <P>It is naive in the extreme &ndash; and &ldquo;naive&rdquo; is not a word I would normally apply to him &ndash; for Deputy Ahern to state that he is now happy as a result of the allocation of the £3,000 allowance to quell the revolt which had such broad-based support right up to the pinnacle of the Fianna Fáil Party. Deputy Ahern is entirely wrong to suggest that the group of community organisations which comprise the so-called &ldquo;third pillar&rdquo; is happy with individualisation. The Deputy put that on the record quite deliberately. They are not at all happy with it but they have done a deal with the Minister, a better deal than we managed to wrest from the Minister in this House or than Deputy Ahern and his fellow back benchers managed to get with the paltry £10 per week credit for stay-at-home spouses.</P>
      <P>The trade unions managed to obtain a significant reversal of the individualisation issue. I am not referring to the £10 per week increase but to the fact that the Programme for Fairness and Prosperity provides that the future increase in the individual band will be in line with wages. That is not what the Minister told us on budget day. He came into this House with a schedule to increase the band by 100% over the course of three years. I do not know what the wages movement will be over the next three years but it will not be of the order of 100%. It is a cumulative 15.75% in the agreement and presumably tax factors will add to that. That might result in a total 20% increase, not a 100% one. In any other parliament in Europe, a Minister for Finance forced to do such a reversal on a cornerstone of his fiscal policy would now be on the back benches making a statement explaining why his own Taoiseach, Government and back benchers forced him to do it. It is just fantastic what the Christian Brothers have done in teaching civil servants and trade union officials to come up with a formula of words which can disguise anything and keep any Minister in office. That is what has happened in the Programme for Fairness and Prosperity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern had a fair point when he said that social partnership raises questions for this House. If one takes account of the extent to which decisions are now being taken at European level on the one hand and at the social partnership level on the other, it certainly erodes the role of this Parliament. We must address that. I supported the idea of social partnership long before I became a Member of this House and, on balance, its benefits outweigh its disadvantages. That Parliament has not managed to obtain any slot in terms of the social partnership and decision making process further erodes our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> Deputy Ahern stated that this was the best of times to be Minister for Finance and I agree with him. He also stated that there is nothing wrong with the tax system. People could go to Bunny Carr for years, as many of Deputy Ahern's colleagues did, but he could not teach them to come up with something <i>ex tempore </i>on the floor of Dáil Éireann to the effect that this tax system is fine and that the only thing wrong with it is that people come into the tax net too soon and are put on to the higher rate too early. That is such a profound defect that it undermines everything Deputy Ahern said. That is what is wrong with the tax system. People currently come into the system at £100 per week and after the budget provisions become law, they will come into it at £110 per week. I cannot for the life of me understand how someone can come into this House and give his blessing to the budget on the basis of an income tax system which has those effects.</P>
    <P>It was left to our colleagues in the trade union movement to extract far better terms. I note that the Minister is now committed to exempting people earning up to £200 per week from the tax system. We must wait and see whether that happens but it would only be fair. We have long argued that if there is to be a minimum wage, it would be absurd to bring people on the minimum income into the tax net.</P>
    <P>It is the best of all times to be Minister for Finance. It is the first time in the history of this State that a Minister for Finance has the resources to significantly address the plight of poor people and introduce real tax reform. Instead, the Minister has opted to cut taxes, thereby ensuring that the major beneficiaries will be the better paid. At the same time he is widening the gap between the rich and the rest of us and between the rest of us and the poor.</P>
    <P>The NESC report, to which the Minister was a party, set out certain priorities. It outlined the necessity to tackle social exclusion; to give priority to increases in the standard rated personal allowances; and to link social welfare payments to improvements in living standards. The Minister thumbed his nose at the NESC consensus pleading an electoral mandate in order to further feather-bed the very well off and in the process earning an inflation warning from Europe. A majority of one is a majority in this House but the Minister is going too far by continually trotting out the line that he has an electoral mandate to screw the poor and reward the rich in the tax code. Matters are not as simplistic as that.</P>
    <P>In spite of having signed up to the NESC strategy report, the Minister further widened the gap between the haves and the have-nots. He provided £942 million in a tax package while at the same time providing £390 million for social exclusion. The vast majority of the £942 million will go to people on higher incomes. A single person on social welfare will receive an additional £4 per week while a single person on an average <Col N="112" /> income will receive an additional £20. A married couple on social welfare will receive £7.80 while an average income couple will receive £40. Deputy McDowell pointed out earlier that a married couple on a combined household income of £50,000 will be £2,444 better off.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency enlisted the assistance of the ESRI to show that after adjustment for indexation of average incomes, the poorest 10% of households will benefit by 0.7% while the richest 10% will benefit by 4.3%. This is the most ideologically savage budget ever introduced by a Minister for Finance. It is viciously anti-poor people, as distinct from being anti-poverty. It has risked fuelling inflation in order to transfer huge benefits to the already well-off. It put social partnership at risk. If it has failed to do so &ndash; we do not know the outcome &ndash; it is only because the Taoiseach, in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, had to attempt what the Minister refused to do in the budget. It was impossible to redress the balance in the new agreement. When social welfare recipients get their £4 increase, it will be eroded by inflation which is already 4%. If one is a smoker one will suffer because of the 50p increase in the price of cigarettes. It seems to be fashionable for everyone in the House to agree with this as a marvellous gesture. I am not so sure if I agree with it. Many of my unfortunate constituents smoke and will do so no matter how much the price is increased by the Minister for Health and Children. Where are they left if one subtracts the increase from the £4 per week?</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies in the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in an attempt to undo what the Minister did in the budget. One of the more undesirable innovations is the PRSI exemption for those earning less than £200 per week. Exempting workers from PRSI and beginning to erode the PRSI fund is of dubious merit and will create new poverty traps as someone earning £201 per week will pay the full rate. The same applies to the levy exemption threshold. These are the measures which must be resorted to in the wake of the injustices created by the budget. The Taoiseach is now becoming a court of appeal for the Minister for Finance. The trade unions go to the Taoiseach, as do the credit union leaders, the INOU and the so-called &ldquo;third pillar&rdquo;. He attempts to redress the injustices done by throwing money at the problem rather than doing what he should have done in the first place which is dismantle the budget.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker said that on budget day the Taoiseach gave an interview to the effect that he did not know anything about this &ndash; he was preoccupied with other matters and it slipped past him. This from a man who would mind mice at a crossroads. The notion that this slipped past the Taoiseach is not credible. Amazingly, all of this is being recklessly driven by a Government which constantly attacked the supposed profligacy of the rainbow Government. Conjuring with figures cannot hide the fact that the average increase in <Col N="113" /> public spending for 1998 and 1999 was about 10%. We do not know what it will be this year. All we know is that it will be more. All of this is coming from a Minister for Finance who likes to present himself as the hard man of fiscal rectitude.</P>
    <P>The budget has undergone so much renovation that it is reminiscent of a famous film star in the United States. The disparity between rich and poor has deliberately been given further impetus. Apparently, the Minister believes that if one is unemployed or on low pay in this tiger economy, it is one's own fault. He has ignored the huge urban tracts where deprivation is clustered. This can only be tackled if the State is prepared to transfer large resources to them. Meanwhile, the Minister ladles on the increases for the rich and powerful. If one lost out last year on the halving of capital gains tax, a word in the ear of the Minister and one will be included this year. The new programme has dramatically altered the Minister's individualisation schedule. This Finance Bill is the most viciously anti-working class ever introduced by an Irish Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for sharing his time. Some measures in this Bill are welcome, for example, those to which Deputy Ahern referred regarding increased provision for the mentally handicapped and so on. However, I find it hard to accept the philosophy running through the Bill. As Deputy Ahern said, there is no doubt that it must be a great time to be Minister for Finance and to be in Government. The largest surplus in the history of our State was available to the Minister for Finance. That is the answer to Deputy Ahern's comparison of increases in social welfare by different Administrations. The Minister could have made significant changes to benefit those with different social opportunities. That he did not do so was not an accident. The reasoning behind his failure to do so can be detected in one statement after another from the budget to yesterday's statement on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's view, acquired by contamination from the Progressive Democrats, is that everyone is entitled to everything they earn, without paying a penny to account for anyone else's need. Therefore, on budget day, the benches were full and everyone was waiting for this Croesus to spend money and give relief to different groups. We knew it would never happen and the poor would end up with 0.7% and the rich with under 5%. The Minister was led by those who wanted a reduction in the top rate of tax and stressed the importance of looking after their plutocratic support rather than those on social welfare &ndash; they won. Many decent members of Fianna Fáil are appalled by this as they are by today's announcement that the transmission service will be sold off and the national broadcaster will become a tenant in what was previously owned by the people and operated so they could hear their own stories. This will generate an even greater surplus. As the <Col N="114" /> Tánaiste said, privatisation will not be stopped. The people will end up owning nothing &ndash; why? This is because the little group which leads the Fianna Fáil Party and drags it along by the nose is against the concept of society. They are not that far from the famous dictum of Mrs. Thatcher that there is no such thing as society.</P>
    <P>With £1.5 billion to spend, the budget does not make one reference to social solidarity. These two words have not passed the lips of Deputy McCreevy since he became Minister for Finance nor those of a Fianna Fáil Deputy since it joined with the Progressive Democrats in forming this Government. However, social solidarity does exist. In his speech, after the long list of tax deductions and those who will not pay as much as previously, the Minister said, &ldquo;These substantial tax reductions will not be lost sight of by the electorate when the appropriate time comes&rdquo;. What a naked, blatant appeal to greed and self-interest. Why would the Government not increase its share of the polls? The message is simple &ndash;&ldquo;say nothing, look at what you have got for yourself&rdquo;. There is nothing about what surrounds us. The appalling suggestion in this Bill is that all poor people could be middle income earners and are restrained from being superrich. We must all aim to be in the super rich category with windfall profits which will now be ideally almost tax free. It is very significant, given that we used to have the Minister of State with responsibility for housing who is present here, up on his hind legs telling us he was reducing the capital gains tax on building land to address the housing problem. In this budget it does not have to be building land at all; any speculative windfall profits and any kind of speculation visiting a huge social cost on society is to have the reduced rate of tax. There is a mentality that this form of society with all its inequalities is a perfect one, that the only thing wrong with poor people is that they are not middle income people and the only thing wrong with both is that they are not rich people and that rich people are entitled, in a perfect world in the vision of the Progressive Democrats and others, not to pay any tax at all as if these people live in an isolated encapsulated world and it did not matter that there were people all around who shared their citizenship, who want a decent education, decent housing, decent health services and who are forced to live on totally inadequate incomes. Does anyone want to compare the people who benefited at the top end from the budget to a person getting £4 and paying 50% more for a packet of cigarettes? How their life was changed by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister with the biggest surplus in the history of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In fairness to him and from his <i>alliance francaise</i>&ndash; as I have described it &ndash; to the Tánaiste, they do not believe in what I am describing. They, and the people who elected them, must take the responsibility for this &ldquo;hard hearted Hannah&rdquo; approach they represent in relation to the Finance Bill. His invitation to them is that they <Col N="115" /> should not forget that he gave the greedy ones what they wanted, that they should not forget this and the top rate of tax will be reduced again the next time. He said &ldquo;these substantial tax reductions will not be lost sight of by the electorate when the appropriate time comes&rdquo;. However, some members of the public care about the concept of society, solidarity and the right to housing, health and to collect tax from those people who can afford to pay it, particularly to hammer taxes on those who make money on doing nothing productive, such as hoarding land with permissions and tormenting people who will never be able to put a roof over their heads. These are the people who gained from the budget. It is all very well for people to express social concern if they vote for such a budget. It is ridiculous to suggest that one can compare this budget to budgets in times of scarcity. It is very different.</P>
    <P>In this budget and all the budgets the Minister is planning there is a mechanistic view of the economy which is that the economy exists quite separately from society, the social order that surrounds it. I referred to this many years ago as &ldquo;the de-peopled economy&rdquo;. The economy is like an engine outside one's door, and it is tended as if it was separate from our lives. In that mechanistic model without any moral view of the economy, the de-peopled economy, there is now a worse view which is that the purpose of the economic measures the Government stands for, and which the Minister introduces in the Finance Bill, is to reward greed and invite people to be greedy. More importantly, he has made a significant shift in his budget speech. He spoke about what I would call &ldquo;a conscription to the economy&rdquo;.  I have the greatest respect for those who try to look after their children in difficult circumstances at times when there is a total absence of child care. As far as the Minister is concerned, child care is not important for the child's sake. Child care is not important to give choices to parents who may wish to make provision at home, in crèches, in work or whatever. Child care is important when it is linked to business, to the economy, when one can extend the socialisation of the costs of industry to include child care. We now get this litany from the Government. There was no housing crisis in Ireland and there is not, until it endangers economic growth. There is no child care problem unless it interferes with employment.</P>
    <P>This is what I mean when I say his invitation to the people was to become prisoners of an economy separate from society, to have an attitude in relation to concern that did not take into account any value beyond oneself; one's neighbour's poverty is one's neighbour's problem. This is the message coming from the Minister of all the riches. He will pile on more surpluses if he can, aided by the Tánaiste who suggests she should not be held back on privatisation, as they prepare one robbery after another, such as the one I <Col N="116" /> described this morning as selling something to private gurriers and which was paid for in the licence fee by citizens of this country so that they could listen to and tell each other their own stories, making them tenants in their own country. The people who have done best from the budget are a type of new landlord class of the super rich who parade and strut around the country giving interviews on how Government decisions made them multi-millionaires overnight, without them having to do anything productive. We are invited to say, &ldquo;Keep going and maybe a grandson, grandchild or granddaughter of yours might be able to do the same, and wouldn't it be wonderful for Ireland?&rdquo;. It is a miserable vision from a miserable Minister for Finance who is simply not concerned. It will always be the same until that mentality is defeated by people who care. Perhaps it is the case that things are at a bad stage in Ireland. Perhaps the greed is deep and we are getting a greedy Government for a greedy people.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to state the consequences of what is being done. A two income family on £50,000 and more will gain substantially from this budget but a person on social welfare benefit will get £4 per week. We are sometimes asked &ldquo;what would we have done?&rdquo;  We published our proposals in relation to the Finance Bill before the Minister produced his budget. There would have been 200,000 more people taken out of the tax net altogether. One does not have to be a genius to ask why not take the people at the bottom out of the tax net? Why not raise the tax band? What special characteristics did the people at the top have? What special case was made for the top rate of tax? The answer is that these people had to be kept happy and we should make sure they do not miss what we have done for them, and they will come to the golf classics and contribute, no doubt. If the top rate of tax was left as it was, the range of services that are desperately required in a civilised society could have been expanded.</P>
    <P>I loved the idea of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, this morning, who in a classic give away suggested that if there is productivity and contingent on future economic growth, there will be an opportunity to do much about social inclusion. It is a residual of there being further economic growth and further productivity. He did not say &ldquo;we are starting with social inclusion&rdquo;. He is saying there will be crumbs for you, we will be seeing you at the back door when we have rewarded everyone else over the period of the national agreement.</P>
    <P>The next issue, which is very interesting, is the long list of matters we can debate on Committee Stage, if we get a chance. There is the notion for example of the building land, but there are other issues, for instance, the reduction in corporation profits tax. What we are now witnessing is a type of casino capitalism, where people are being invited as stars. They do not win the lotto, they could get a Government licence. This is the privatisation agenda, selling what does not belong to <Col N="117" /> one, selling what belonged to the public to a few people who may later sell it on to others at enormous profit. Then one is supposed to stand up and give a &ldquo;hallelujah&rdquo;. This is called enterprise, entrepreneurship. Whatever it is called, it is theft from the public and we will hear more later about the latest scam in relation to that.</P>
    <P>It is time people looked carefully at particulars in the budget which I have not the opportunity in the time available to mention. How many extra carers are facilitated in the budget? Was the means testing for this reduced? No, it was not. How many people on the lowest possible incomes will be able to participate in society any better?</P>
    <P>The Minister allowed himself a flourish at the start of the debate. It is the type of flourish that has a certain vulgar peasant charm to it. He said:</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in bringing before the House the first Finance Bill of the century. It is in many ways a noteworthy event, particularly as there has been much speculation in some quarters as to what the Bill may contain.</P>
    <P>He also said in a little piece of peasant cunning:</P>
    <P>These substantial tax reductions will not be lost sight of by the electorate when the appropriate time comes.</P>
    <P>It is a miserable electorate that would vote for a miserable budget at a time of great surplus which has left so many poor people and others who had hoped for real participation in citizenship unhelped. Let the chorus of the new plutocrats, the new landlords, ring in the Minister's ears. I hope that after the next election he will have more time to spend with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Browne. I support the Finance Bill. It is key legislation which brings about various changes that were introduced in the budget last December. However, the budget is not the only instrument available to the Government to bring about economic change. Within the last three months, substantial policy changes have been put in place which will have far-reaching social and economic implications.</P>
      <P>The budget is an extremely important arm of the Government's economic and social policy. However, the Government has also forwarded the national development plan, worth over £40 billion, to the European Commission. It outlines spending and investment priorities for the seven year period, 2000 to 2006. The Government has also concluded the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which will put in place, subject to the approval of the trade unions, fair and rewarding wage increases over the next 33 months. The national development plan, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the budget must be considered together because they are interlinked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before considering in detail the budgetary changes which will be brought about in the Finance Bill, I wish to reflect on events which <Col N="118" /> brought us to this stage. Since 1987 budgetary restraint has been a core principle of consecutive Governments and has ensured an economic turn around in the competitive position of businesses. Wage agreements brought about by widespread consultation between the Government, trade unions and employer groups have guaranteed that industrial unrest has been minimised. This has broadened Ireland's appeal as a destination for foreign investment.</P>
    <P>Lower borrowing, a reduction in the country's debt/GNP ratio, falling unemployment and annual growth rates between 8% and 10% have all played their part in bringing about an economic turnaround. In a way, Ireland is at a crossroads. The average income <i>per capita</i> is now higher than ever. Ireland has gone from being the poor mouth of the European Union to becoming the fifth wealthiest nation in the EU. This has created tough and challenging choices for the Government regarding the direction in which society will go.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the publication of the national development plan that the Government has decided that the economic gains made to date must be consolidated and made permanent. This is why £17.6 billion will be spent under the economic and social infrastructure operational programme over the next seven years. Improvements in the national road network, public transport systems and waste water treatment facilities will be key elements of the programme.</P>
    <P>In addition, £6 billion has been put aside for building social and affordable housing schemes. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, recently announced a record number of house completions in 1999, totalling over 46,500 units. This is an increase of 10% on the 1998 figures. Output nationally in 1999 in terms of new house completions was more than twice the output achieved in 1993. This record output comes at a time when the Government is set to fundamentally strengthen the role of local authorities in the planning and provision of housing. The allocation of £6 billion under the national development plan will go a long way towards achieving such policy objectives in this regard. The Government is well on course to achieve a national housing output of 55,000 new units in 2000.</P>
    <P>While economic growth is now more widespread than ever, the Government also recognises that many key social problems still remain. While annual growth of 8% to 10% in recent years has increased the quality of life of many families, it has not filtered through to all sectors of society. The national development plan, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the Finance Bill are all geared towards bringing about social changes which will help the less well off in society. This is why the social content of the budget, totalling over £500 million, will ensure that comprehensive additional social inclusion measures are proceeded with in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The old age contributory pension has been <Col N="119" /> increased by £18 under the Government, compared to half that amount during the three Rainbow Government budgets. I am confident that such pensions will be £100 a week before we next face the electorate. Those who call the current increase of £7 in the old age contributory pension paltry should look back to 1995 when the then Rainbow Government gave an increase of only £1.80. However, the Social Welfare Bill includes the necessary changes to the social welfare code as well as other changes necessary as a result of the talks on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of the budget was the changes in taxation. Nobody can dispute the fact that £1 billion given in tax relief far exceeds the amounts given in the last three budgets. The Government has acknowledged the importance of increasing tax free allowances. They have been increased by over £1,800 for a single person and double that for a married couple over the Government's last three budgets. This compares to a total of only £550, or a third of that figure, given in the three Rainbow Government budgets. The tax free allowance now stands at £4,700 and this will take 50,000 people out of the tax net.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government also promised the electorate that it would cut tax rates, and it has done so. There has been a reduction of 4% in each rate of tax. The higher rate has been reduced from 48% to 44% while the standard rate has been reduced from 26% to 22% since the Government took office in 1997. This compares to a reduction of only 1% in the standard rate when the Rainbow Government was in office. The change in the bands whereby a person will not pay tax at the higher rate until he or she earns over £17,000 will ensure that 125,000 people now will not have to pay tax at the top rate in the coming years.</P>
    <P>It is fundamentally inequitable that many newcomers to the workforce should have to pay the higher rate of tax when they are earning below the average industrial wage. The increase in tax free allowances and the putting in place of a structure whereby 125,000 people will not have to pay tax at the top rate will reward lower to middle income earners. The taxation system in its simplicity has always been too brutal. In part, this may have been the case because of the horrendous economic conditions of the 1980s. However, the 1990s brought about change and lowering the burden of taxation on workers is a cornerstone of Government policy. Matched to this is the commitment to wage increases in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which will be implemented over the next 33 months if the trade unions support the programme after ballots of their members.</P>
    <P>There is broad agreement in the House on the necessity and desirability of cutting corporate tax rates to 12.5% in the coming years which has had a huge spin-off in terms of stimulating business. Corporate tax revenue has now almost doubled <Col N="120" /> from just under £1.7 billion in 1997 to over £3 billion in 2000.</P>
    <P>Revenue receipts from capital gains tax &ndash; which the previous speaker criticised &ndash; have also increased from £132 million to £343 million. This is as a result of clearly halving the liability on capital gains which encourages people to take a profit on property gains and reinvest.</P>
    <P>I support the general changes in the capital acquisitions tax code. This is a taxation, whether by means of inheritance or gifts, which needs to be streamlined. Payment in the future of capital acquisitions tax at 20% is fair and balanced. I also welcome changes which will be brought about in the transfer of a family home and definitions relating to same. There have been too many hardship cases where a particular individual, who is not married to the person who owns the home and has died, has to pay a huge and unjustifiable tax bill. These changes to the capital acquisitions tax code are certainly bold. However, the Government will have to keep a close watch on these changes to see how they operate in practice.</P>
    <P>The budget will ensure that taxpayers on average incomes will be between £20 and £30 a week better off. This is carried forward with the process of radical tax reform. We can face the first years of the new century with a sense of confidence. There are now only 172,000 unemployed which is comparable only to 1982 figures. The percentage unemployed is down to 5.1% and is likely to fall below 5% next year.</P>
    <P>The general Government debt/GDP ratio is set to fall to 46% in 2000 and rapidly thereafter. The Government no longer needs to borrow even for capital investment. Apart from the £3 billion in EU funding, we are able to fund from our own resources the major infrastructure programme in the national development plan at a cost of £41 billion while putting money aside for the funding of pensions.</P>
    <P>As public finances have improved there has been a progressive and real reform of the tax system. We have lowered the tax burden while strengthening the social safety net. These are sensible policies which are being considered by the Government, all of which I support.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Finance Bill and compliment the Minister on some of the changes made on a number of issues since the budget. I welcome the reduction in tax rates not only this year but in recent years. This is encouraging more people to enter the workforce and they have more take home pay. I recall the high tax rates of 55% when it was more productive for people to remain on social welfare than to work. I am pleased the Minister, in his wisdom, through a combination of tax reductions, widening of tax bands, individualisation, etc, has managed to reduce the amount of tax people have to pay. That is reflected in the number of people entering <Col N="121" /> the workforce. We now have the lowest number on the live register in our history.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger is not roaring in all sections of the community. Sometimes as the Celtic tiger roars I think greed is taking over our little nation and that the well off and particular sections of the community are making vast amounts of money while others are left behind. At a time of plenty and prosperity that should not be allowed to continue. We have heard much in the past few months about social exclusion and the need to bring people on board. I hope the Minister will ensure that happens.</P>
      <P>While we all welcome the new agreement between unions, employers, farmers and all the different sections of the community, I wonder about the decisions reached at. Most of the unions have welcomed it and said it is the best deal that could have been reached. However, the deal will do little if anything for the low paid and the socially excluded. Given the increases negotiated, those at the higher end of the scale will receive the largest increases. I have no doubt the trade union leaders on £70,000, £80,000 and £100,000 per year will receive substantial increases.</P>
      <P>At the end of the 33 month period of the agreement the socially excluded will have received little. If one looks at the Celtic tiger as it roars on, builders, big businesses and land speculators are making most of the money. While that is happening the local authority housing lists are getting longer because many are not in a position to buy their own homes. Even in rural areas and small towns, houses which were selling for £100,000 a month ago suddenly increase to £120,000 if the first lot is snapped up. I spoke with a builder last week whose first sale of houses, in the town in which I live, was so successful that he decided to move elsewhere because by summer these houses will be worth an additional £30,000. There is much exploitation in that area which the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Finance should consider. Given the increased house prices many people are not in a position to buy their own homes and it is not getting any easier despite what Ministers may say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the home carer's allowance. While there was some hullabaloo at budget time and many went out on the plinth and attacked the Minister, the home carer's allowance is very important. From a family point of view the contribution of the spouse who stays at home to look after the children or a handicapped person should be reflected in any Government's tax policy. I am pleased the Minister has recognised that and introduced a scheme which will be of major benefit to the stay-at-home spouse. He has introduced it in such a way that people can earn a certain amount and still avail of the home carer's allowance. It is obvious the Minister was reflecting the views of all sides when introducing the scheme, for which I thank him. I hope the allowance will continue to be increased in future years. The Ministers for Finance, Social, Community and <Col N="122" /> Family Affairs and Health and Children should revisit the question of the carer's allowance. This allowance is very important but the means test is too strict. Many people are excluded from the allowance because of their very modest incomes. Nursing homes in the south-east cost £500 per week and I am sure costs are similar in other parts of the country. It costs more than £1,000 per week to keep a person in hospital. A small extension of the means test for the carer's allowance would allow many people to look after their aged parents or others who require full-time care in the home. Some changes have been made in the scheme but they do not go far enough. The Minister should examine this issue.</P>
    <P>High nursing home charges are partly caused by the shortage of nursing homes, particularly in rural areas. Although the standard of many homes leaves much to be desired and although costs are high, many elderly people have no alternative but to go into their local nursing home. Section 32 of the Bill allows capital allowances for expenditure on nursing homes. I welcome this measure. I am surprised that more builders are not building nursing homes &ndash; I presume they are making too much money building houses. However, I am glad the Minister has decided to continue this capital allowance. I hope builders and other investors will consider this area of investment. There is a dire need for nursing homes throughout the country and, as our population gets older, this need will increase.</P>
    <P>Urban and rural renewal schemes have been very successful. The small towns scheme was proposed to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government by Wexford County Council two years ago when he visited the county. I am glad that we are about to see smaller towns with populations of 500 people benefiting from this scheme. There is much dereliction in small towns throughout the country. This scheme will give an incentive to builders, developers and local people who own businesses to develop them. There have been arguments in many counties about the selection of towns for the scheme. Nevertheless, I ask the Minister to make the scheme operational so that developments can take place as quickly as possible. I also ask him to encourage developments which incorporate over-the-shop living accommodation. In Enniscorthy, where I live, very few people live in the centre of the town and it is important to bring life back into our towns. I hope the Minister will ensure that as much over-shop and over-office space as possible is used for living accommodation.</P>
    <P>The recent tax evasion and banking scandals have been politically very damaging. The reputations of all politicians have suffered because of the actions of a few. We know that 99% of politicians are decent honourable people and it is important that we make it clear that tax evasion will not be tolerated by this or any future Government or by any politician. Section 138 of the Bill provides for changes in the legal requirements for the publication of details of tax <Col N="123" /> defaulters. All tax defaulters should have their names published. PAYE workers must pay their taxes and we must make it clear to them and to other honest taxpayers that we will ensure that tax defaulters are brought to justice. It is widely believed that people who move in certain circles can avoid paying tax and break the law in other ways while ordinary people must pay their taxes and face the consequences of any misdemeanours. All politicians must make it clear that we adhere to the principle that tax must be paid and defaulters should be punished.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the question of giving incentives to builders to build local authority houses. About five or six years ago builders were beating on the doors of local authorities offering to build local authority houses, but because the building industry is buoyant it is now almost impossible to find a builder to build local authority housing. The Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government are right to want to provide more local authority houses. It is important to provide the maximum possible number of houses for people on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In the past two years, Wexford County Council has found it very difficult to find builders. When builders begin a local authority scheme we find it very difficult to have the schemes completed. House completions can take a year or 18 months. Penalty clauses do not appear to be successful. We must find a way to involve the private building sector in building local authority houses and in making a percentage of affordable houses available, as the Minister is trying to do. I hope the incentives provided in the Finance Bill will encourage the completion of as many local authority and affordable houses as possible. The scarcity of houses and their high cost is causing a serious problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced important incentives for the PAYE sector over the past four years. In opposition one attacks the Government but it is important to recognise that the Minister has made an effort by way of the tax incentives introduced in the PAYE sector in the last four years to make it more profitable to go out to work. That is what we have all been calling for for years. The person who goes out to work should not be crucified by a penal taxation system. The taxation system should be reformed to encourage young people in particular to go out to work and thus ensure the economy continues to boom. Although interest rates are rising, which will have an effect on inflation, we have had a relatively bump free ride in the last five or six years. Some hiccups are inevitable along the way but I have no doubt that with proper management of the public finances the Celtic tiger will continue to roar for all the people, not just certain sectors. The Minister is trying to ensure the less well off will benefit and be much better off when the Government completes its term of office in two and a half years time and prepares to re-enter <Col N="124" /> office. It is important that the socially excluded are brought on board, given a voice and made feel wanted and part of the Celtic tiger.</P>

      <P>If there is one thing the Government is good at it is public relations. There is vanity but no sanity. The spin doctors are well paid and on much higher salaries than Deputies. It is funny but I have yet to see their big salaries and expenses mentioned in the newspapers but they do a good job for the Government which has been telling the people how well they have been doing and will do in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Many people were outraged by the recent budget. There is no doubt that the Minister got it wrong as there have been three further budgets since Christmas. With the publication of the Finance Bill we now know which one he will use. What the Government and the PR people are doing is wrong; they are being dishonest in stating that everybody is being touched by the Celtic tiger. Rather than benefiting, many are suffering because of the policies being pursued on housing, farming and health. Nothing is being done for them. I am referring in particular to those on middle incomes who cannot afford to send their children to third level and do not qualify for a medical card or other forms of assistance from the State. They have big mortagages and are finding it difficult to make ends meet. They are put under pressure by their children to feed and buy clothes for them to the same standard as Joe Soap next door and all the time the story is being spun that the economy is performing well and that there is no shortage of employment opportunities or money. The ones doing business are the banks and leasing companies. If one does not have a penny in one's pocket and wants to buy a £50,000 car all one has to do is sign up. The country is full of such people who have borrowed money they cannot afford to repay, draining the economy in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday I met in my clinic a lady who is seeking to be accommodated in public housing. Currently she is renting a one bedroom apartment for which she is paying £95 per week. Half of the housing stock in the town in which I live is located within the tax designation area and as a consequence is owned by persons from outside the county. The lady's husband works as a janitor in a hotel and brings home about £200 per week. They are not in receipt of a rent allowance. To avail of the tax break the developer who owns the property has to make it available for tourism purposes between April and October. As the lady concerned only has a short-term lease she cannot have an ESB meter installed. She showed me an electricity bill, not from the ESB but from the developer. The ESB charges 8.1p per unit of elec<Col N="125" /> tricity in a domestic dwelling; the lady concerned is being charged 11p per unit by the developer. Her bill should have been £175 for the two month period in question but she was charged £300 by the developer. That is immoral. If that is what the Celtic tiger is about there are many people &ndash; I am referring to the wealthy &ndash; who are very sick. The owner of the property in question is a big builder who changes his car every two months, not every two or three years. He drives a BMW. He also has a Mercedes which he uses on Sundays and all the time he is crucifying the poor little creature on £200 per week who has two young children. There is something wrong with society when something like this can happen.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I raised the case of a man who was awaiting an operation. It was a case of seventh time lucky. He went into hospital in Galway last Saturday and the operation was performed this week. There is something wrong with society when a sick man in pain is admitted to hospital six times and sent home each time. The health service is in disarray.</P>
    <P>In 1996 there were in the order of 1,300 on the orthodontic waiting list. I was informed in reply to a parliamentary question last week that this figure has increased to over 4,000. If there is one thing that the new Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, who is present in the House, and the chairperson of the Western Health Board, Deputy Cooper-Flynn, should do it is to take on the officials dealing with the health services. There is something wrong when a man is admitted to hospital six times and sent home each time and when the orthodontic waiting list has increased in four years by almost 3,000. I am sick and tired of being told that the economy is performing well.</P>
    <P>I will leave the issue of child care until another day. The elderly now pay VAT on the telephone monitoring service provided by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and on their ESB and telephone bills among others. Pensioners over the age of 70 should not have to pay VAT on essential services. The opportunity should have been taken in the budget to exempt them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne referred to the establishment of nursing homes. I do not wish to see developers get involved in the construction of nursing homes because the few I have seen constructed recently are merely functional. The Ombudsman reported that most of the complaints he received were about nursing homes. If I was the newly appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children and this fell within my remit, I would look at the establishment of a regulator for nursing homes. As the age profile increases there will be more difficulties. There will be incentives for people to develop nursing homes, but the care of the elderly might take a back seat to the care of profits. That is a matter at which the Minister may look.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill, which should give effect to <Col N="126" /> the Government's budgetary proposals, has been born out of much controversy. What should have been a routine celebration evolved into the party from hell, as Member after Member on the Government side came forward to criticise the Minister's budget. Whether it was orchestrated or not, it was not an edifying sight and it may have set an unhealthy precedent. To my mind it was an indication of a lack or an absence of leadership in the main Government party as its most senior Minister was abandoned in a time of need. I found it all the more amusing on viewing a video clip of the Minister's Budget Statement, when one could clearly view the Members happily clapping as they bellowed out, &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  It certainly gives one food for thought. That video clip may become a collectors' item in time to come.</P>
    <P>That said, a Finance Bill has been produced, much of which was not contained in the Budget Statement. It would appear that the Bill, in conjunction with the Social Welfare Bill, will bring increases in excess of £300 million over and above that for which the budget had allowed. However, this change in policy brings into question the ability of the Government to plan for and supervise the economy. At this stage, most members of the public are unaware which budgetary measures will be implemented and which will be binned.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that time would tell, but budget 2000 will be seen as a defining point in the evolution of tax policy in the State. I hope it will not be seen as a defining point in the evolution or otherwise of the economy, as its expansionary policy impacts on inflation. It has created a real concern that the Government is not capable of managing our wealth.</P>
    <P>Are we really as wealthy as we think? Deputy Ring spoke about the spin doctors telling us how well we were doing, but a middle income couple in the greater Dublin area, who do not own a house, would not think so. A student nurse would not think so nor would a young child in the Eastern Health Board area awaiting orthodontic treatment for four years. The improved economy has not helped with hip replacements. If you are a 40 year old awaiting adoption assessment in the South Eastern Health Board, the prospect of being assessed in 2005 is far from proof positive that things have changed for the better. Widows, widowers and old age pensioners have again seen their expectations dashed by a minimal increase, while all the time growing inflation impacts upon them. I get the impression that the Government is happy to meet its commitments to this section of society in the context of the next general election as opposed to having a genuine concern about the marginalised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in section 21, which provide tax relief for postgraduate fees under certain conditions. At a time when there are many opportunities to draw people away from the education system, it is imperative that every possible incentive is put in place. However, the income levels in place for qualification for grants at <Col N="127" /> degree or diploma levels should be increased. Many families, particularly those in the PAYE bracket, cannot afford to send their children to a third level institute.</P>
    <P>There are certain items excluded from the budget which I would have liked to have seen included. Section 137 deals with donations of heritage items. I wish the Minister had included a relief for the many young couples who, at the request of Dúchas, must pay archaeologists to carry out digs on the proposed site of their house before building may commence.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister has received many requests from retired military personnel who are seeking to have military service allowance calculated into their pensions. It is unfair that some people availing of an Army pension are included while others are excluded and I hope that this can be addressed in the forthcoming pensions Bill.</P>
    <P>In the time remaining to me I want to concentrate on section 72, which deals with the new town renewal scheme. It is proposed that it will come into effect on 1 April next and operate until 31 March 2003, subject to EU approval of the business elements of the reliefs. I have spoken about this scheme on the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, and I wish to reiterate the points I made then. As far as I can recall, a letter of instruction was issued when the scheme was being developed to the effect that section 23 development should be used sparingly. In most of these small towns, a small number of people own many properties. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind. I realise that the scheme is not designed to make the rich richer but rather to resurrect the derelict centres of towns. If the scheme is to be successful, however, it is imperative that the various incentives are put in place for the people who own the properties.</P>
    <P>I regret I do not have more time because there are many other issues which I wish to address. The Bill has many shortcomings. This is highlighted by Deputy Noonan's amendment, which points up numerous issues. If these had been included at the outset, the Bill would be much improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Timmins, in what he said about the urban renewal scheme. That has been a mess for a long time and we want to get it cleared up and move forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome that the Minister for Finance has basically accepted the Fine Gael proposals on inheritance and gift tax. They are a major improvement. It is important that family homes, businesses, farms, etc. can be transferred at a reasonable cost. The previous position was causing a great deal of pain, especially in the housing sector. However, it is a pity that the Fine Gael proposals on income tax were not taken into account also. Deputy Noonan spelled out clearly what needed to be done to make sure that those on low incomes were taken out of the tax net. <Col N="128" /> The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has moved that net from £100 to £110.</P>
    <P>However, since the budget the Minister has done many other U-turns. He has signed up to a national agreement under which the likely minimum wage will be £200. He and his Government colleagues are saying that in time those on this wage level will be taken out of the tax net, but it is a pity he did not move more towards that this year.</P>
    <P>What will be the overall cost to the economy of individualisation? The rate of inflation, at 4.4%, is double the European average. The Government has missed its targets in each of the previous two years. With planned spending of 4%, it went to 10% and it will be 10% or more this year. If the Government was serious about trying to minimise inflation, and while I do not disagree with it increasing the tax on cigarettes and tobacco, it could easily have reduced the tax on petrol and diesel and lowered the cost to those who must maintain cars on the roads. This would have certainly helped to balance the inflation problem.</P>
    <P>The low paid derived no benefit from the budget. Recently I met a young factory worker on £200 per week. He will benefit to the tune of £4 per week on 6 April. However, he smokes 20 cigarettes a day and, therefore, since budget day he has been losing £3.50 per week. Overall he will gain nothing extra this year. A married man on £370 will gain £7 a week. However, a married couple or partners &ndash; as this is often the more desired way to live now &ndash; on £51,000 a year will gain £50 per week. A disabled person will gain £4 per week and a disabled couple will gain £7.80, with inflation at 4.4%.</P>
    <P>I understand, from what the Taoiseach said this morning, that the minimum wage will be introduced. What will be the cost to industry? In the Border region, we have many low paid jobs and we do not have the hi-tech industries many people said we would get very shortly. We expected miracles but they did not happen. A person earning up to £170 per week should be exempt from tax. If that were the case, industry and those earning that amount would be much better off.</P>
    <P>When will the minimum wage be introduced? How much time will industry get to implement it? That is the question those involved in industry are asking. It has been talked about for a long time but we were told only this morning it would be introduced on 1 April. How can industry adjust to this? The Government expects everybody to jump when it says so.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Browne said earlier, the housing situation is in a shambles. If the Minister was serious about housing, he would have made sure extra money was made available to local authorities to build more houses or at least ensure low cost housing was available through some source to avoid the present crisis.</P>
    <P>In regard to carers, there is no change in the disregard of £150 introduced in the 1996 budget. It has not been changed in the past three budgets, <Col N="129" /> although wages have increased. The Rainbow Government changed it in its two budgets. There is no increase in the nursing home subvention. I recently met a carer who looks after her sister and whose husband works in an ordinary job. She cannot get a penny, yet she could allow that young person who is dying of cancer, and for whom she cares, to go into a home or elsewhere. This State, despite the Celtic tiger roving about, is not prepared to do anything for her.</P>
    <P>Farm assist was supposed to solve the problem of low paid farmers. According to the Minister in a reply to me a few weeks ago, more than 1,000 farmers have been taken out of the farm income programme and those who are still included receive about £2 less on average than what they got in real terms 12 months ago. Where is the Celtic tiger? Child care is another major issue.</P>
    <P>Roads are still a serious issue as far as rural dwellers are concerned. County Monaghan &ndash; it is not much different in County Cavan &ndash; got an increase of £31,000 this year as against its allocation last year. When one considers the increase in the price of tar and oil, wage increases and inflation, what will that mean? That £31,000 will be divided between four road areas. The situation is extremely serious.</P>
    <P>People in rural areas want to know where the Celtic tiger is and whether it has one, two, three or four legs because it has not been seen 30 miles outside the capital city or in a few other areas. I ask the Minister to use this opportunity to assist the low paid, the disabled and those who are less well off and to make this Finance Bill relevant to the low paid and the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill implements a budget that was and is disgracefully biased in favour of the better off. No Minister for Finance has been in a stronger position or has been better placed to implement tax changes which could substantially benefit the lower paid. Instead, this skewed Finance Bill once more benefits disproportionately the higher earners. It provides for the reduction of the top rate of tax from 46% to 44%, a costly measure for which there was neither need nor demand. The Bill reduces the standard rate of tax from 24% to 22% but the low paid still remain in the tax net.</P>
      <P>Those on the proposed national minimum wage will remain in the tax net. No Government was ever in a better position to implement a minimum wage but three years on from the pre-election commitment of Fianna Fáil, we are only now seeing the beginning of the process. Under the proposed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the national minimum wage will rise to £5 per hour only from October 2002. Those workers will still be in the tax net and, by that time, will have fallen behind other workers in real pay terms. By that time also, this Minister for Finance will be out of office but he will have earned the gratitude of the wealthiest in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's patch up job on the 1 December budget after the cuts and bruises <Col N="130" /> it sustained, we had the PRSI and health levy exemptions for the lower paid. This is a classic patch up job. Instead of taking from those who can most afford it and giving to those most in need, this measure simply dips into the social insurance fund which belongs to all workers in an attempt to make some amends for the gross inequities of the 1 December budget.</P>
    <P>Contrast the treatment of the low paid in the Finance Bill with the treatment of the corporate sector. Yet again the Minister has provided a bonanza for this sector, including the banks and other financial institutions whose gross profiteering is notorious, as is their disdain for the small customer and the small business in favour of the large deposit holders. The DIRT inquiry has revealed the extent to which these institutions actively embezzled funds that were badly needed for public services. Their reward today is tax reduction. It has been estimated that the reduction in the corporation tax rate over the past three years will save the corporate sector close on £400 million in every subsequent year.</P>
    <P>Even this is not enough because we learned today that the Financial Services Industry Association is cracking the whip at the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and threatening that if the Revenue Commissioners continue to pursue DIRT vigorously, as they are obliged to do, major companies will pull out of the International Financial Services Centre. This is outrageous blackmail by an arrogant corporate sector which has been given the most favoured treatment by this and previous Governments. The ordinary worker who has tax taken from his or her weekly pay packet has no choice but these multinational profiteers spend huge sums on avoiding and evading tax as well as benefiting from massive tax breaks. I urge that this blackmail is rejected by the Minister and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>One of the most glaring omissions from the budget was its failure to effectively address the housing crisis. There are no imaginative tax measures in this Bill to free up housing such as the capital gains tax increases which I and my party proposed to the Minister in our pre-budget submission. That would have curbed property speculation. There is the further measure which has not been addressed or included &ndash; the abolition of stamp duty for houses worth under £150,000. The gaps in this Finance Bill and the deeply flawed measures on housing land in the Planning and Development Bill again highlight the lack of a comprehensive housing strategy on the part of this Government. It is a crisis &ndash; make no mistake about it. It is a crisis for every needy family on all local authority waiting lists throughout this State.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this Bill which refers directly to the town renewal scheme, which I welcome. I have seen the benefit of previous urban renewal schemes in the counties I represent. In my home county of Monaghan, three of the four applicant towns were approved for inclusion in the new <Col N="131" /> scheme. I would like the fourth, Carrickmacross, included and, accordingly, I urge an extension of this scheme to allow for the maximum take up providing for the rejuvenation of all our small and medium sized towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support the motion. I support the general concept of car testing. Too many people lose their lives annually on Irish roads. Every effort should be made to make road safety a priority in all our <Col N="132" /> lives. Regular car testing is but a small part of the programme to ensure we are safe on the roads. A comprehensive road safety programme should comprise a wide range of measures, including greater emphasis on seat belt wearing, a year round clampdown on drink-driving and, most importantly, measures to end speeding on our roads.</P>
      <P>The last annual report of the National Safety Council shows that 82% of road fatalities were the result of speeding. That statistic alone points to the fact that it is not the quality of cars on our roads that causes the majority of accidents but the way we use our cars. Over the past two years the Government indicated it intends to introduce penalty points for dangerous driving but as of yet efforts have not been made to allow for the implementation of such legislation. A penalty points system would go some way towards reducing the incidence of road accidents and dangerous driving which has reached a frightening level. Under such a system an errant driver is deducted points for each minor breach of the law. Points are deducted for such offences as not wearing a seat belt, breaches of traffic signals and driving without caution. Will the Minister indicate when the Government intends to introduce legislation on penalty points?</P>
      <P>The national car test will ensure there will be better cars on our roads but it will also place major financial pressures on those who cannot afford to buy a new car every four or five years. It is generally the least well off in our society who drive older cars and among that group are the elderly. Their old car is often their lifeline to the outside world. For them their car is of paramount importance in getting to the shop, the post office, the doctor, the hospital and to visit a relative or a neighbour. Those people are not in the business of speeding and putting lives at risk and they should not be put in a position where they must fork out money for car testing when they cannot afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not make a case for free car testing for the elderly if we had a decent public transport system, particularly in rural areas. That would ensure the elderly had constant access to services, but we all know the reality. Public transport services in rural Ireland are appalling and people are forced to find alternative transport. The inadequate public transport system is only in the ha'penny place when it is set against the state of some of the roads in rural areas. In my constituency of Kerry South the condition of some of the roads has caused premature depreciation of cars; cars are old in six months. If the Minister does not take my word for it, I invite him to speak to road users in the Dingle area who were forced to storm our county council meeting last Monday because they can no longer tolerate the outrageous conditions of the roads there. The Minister was in the constituency last week and was taken around by the officials and shown the condition of the roads. I hope he will not let the people of Kerry <Col N="133" /> South down. It would be very unfair if the elderly had to pay for their car test.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the car test should have been accompanied by a package of measures that would have ensured better driving standards and better driving conditions. In addition, it should have recognised the financial burden it imposes on the elderly in particular. Since the car test was introduced I am aware of cases where garages cannot sell perfectly good cars until the due date of the test. For example, if a car was brought in by a garage owner today and the tax on it is not due until next July, he must hold on to that car until next July when it will be certified. Perfectly good cars are now parked in garages and it is often the people who are on a low income who can only afford a second-hand car who are affected by this. I ask the Minister to address this problem by putting in place a fast-tracking system to ensure garages are not forced to hold such cars.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment to the motion does not address the financial burden that has been imposed on those who can least afford it. That is the message in this motion. While the amendment underlines the Government's commitment to introduce a more equitable driving licence fee for persons over the age of 70, there is no time scale for its introduction. When does the Minister intend to implement this measure?</P>
    <P>I call on local authorities to introduce a notification procedure to inform people of the due date for the renewal of their driving licences. Such a notification procedure exists for car tax and insurance and it should be a simple matter to extend it to driving licences. Licences are issued generally for five years or ten years and given that time span it is easy for people to forget to resubmit their applications for renewal on time. Where motorists forget to do that, they have to resit their driving test and given the current waiting list for the driving test, they would have to wait a long time to resit their test.</P>
    <P>I would like to address the impact motor vehicles have on our environment. Motor cars are a necessity in modern day life, particularly where there is not access to any means of public transport, which, in effect, is the situation outside of Dublin. I accept the emissions they produce contribute to environmental damage, but I do not accept that the national car test will reduce this damaging effect. The motor vehicle manufacturing industry must take greater responsibility in ensuring the cars they produce cause minimum damage to our environment.</P>
    <P>More new cars on our roads are not necessarily better for the environment because for every new car that is put on the road, an old one must be disposed of. As of yet, we do not have any appropriate recycling facilities to deal with used cars and the Government must take action on this, particularly in view of the national car test scheme. I ask the Minister to address this matter immediately, otherwise our roadsides will be strewn with old cars. I support the motion.</P>

      <P>At a time when a multitude of issues need to be addressed, it shows the state of the Fine Gael Party when it has to resort to a motion such as this in Private Members' time. There are other issues in relation to car use, the environment, car safety and so on that could have been addressed, but this is what they have resorted to.</P>
      <P>The national car test was introduced by the Government in January. The previous Government decided the framework for the car test. The plans involving the operation of the test on a public private partnership and self-funding basis were accordingly followed by this Government. The previous Government at no time made provisions for the elderly or for social welfare recipients. Granting a subsidy to older people would almost certainly lead to similar claims from other sections of society. That would erode the self-financing principle behind the service that was decided on by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Unlike other areas of private expenditure, the cost of motoring has not been subject to social subsidies except for drivers with disabilities. The Government is not aware of any subsidisation scheme for old age pensioners or social welfare recipients in any other EU member state in relation to vehicle testing. Neither am I aware of any request for concessions for older people from organisations that represent them. It is hardly a people-driven demand. I would say it is part of the bluff and bluster of the Opposition to try to get publicity.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of granting free tests and re-tests to people over 65, if we follow the principle of a self-funding test as envisaged by the previous Government, could raise the non-concessionary test fee from £35 to £51, an increase of almost 46%. On the question of driving licences for people over 70, I was delighted by the Minister's decision to introduce revised licence fee arrangements which will be structured more favourably towards persons aged over 70 years. That is a welcome trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw attention to an issue that has been adverted to by the previous speaker. That is the issue of recycling used cars. The Dublin area, and particularly parts of it, has a very serious problem with what are called &ldquo;company cars&rdquo;. For example, the abandoned vehicle section of Dublin Corporation recovered 500 such cars in January, 166 in one week alone, which is an all-time record. Roughly 200 were found to be burned. One hundred and fifty of those were removed with the owners' consent. Twenty or thirty of them were recovered from the pound &ndash; I presume people did not bother to claim them after they were clamped. The rest were old wrecks. Scrappage schemes are currently being advertised on radio and on television by main car dealers, <Col N="135" /> inviting car owners to trade in their cars. Wittingly or otherwise, many of these cars end up back on the streets and this is causing havoc in areas such as Ballyfermot, Finglas, Darndale and elsewhere because it is now possible for a group of young people to buy a &ldquo;company car&rdquo; for as little as £50. We came across a case recently where a car was bona fide traded in to a reputable garage. Without going into the boring details, it ended up in one of these roadside dumps which are being used as a recycling centre by members of the travelling community. Local youths bought that car, filled it with petrol and drove it around housing estates in the north side of Dublin until such time as it would not go any further. They then abandoned it. The Garda, to their credit, collected the car the next day and towed it back to its previous owner and left it there.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look at the issue of tracking cars from owner to owner, which is not satisfactory. Some method must be devised for filling in the forms so that cars can be tracked. At the moment in Dublin, cars manufactured from 1988 to 1991 are coming back on to the roads. They are dangerous and would have failed the vehicle test. Will the Minister consider the possibility of tightening the regulations to some extent?</P>
    <P>Another issue that needs to be looked at is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There is something fundamentally very wrong when youngsters as young as 12, 13 and 14 can buy a car and drive it around. It is an offence to drive a car without tax, insurance or licence, but one has ten days to produce them. These young people are a danger to themselves and to the public and this is something that needs to be addressed. Again this week, Dublin Corporation had to hire machinery to recover cars from places such as Cherry Orchard where between 60 and 100 such cars were abandoned in fields and drains, Scribblestown Lane in Finglas and Belcamp Lane in Coolock. That is what we are confronted with as a result of not implementing regulations in relation to the scrappage scheme. We must ensure that the last registered owner of a car is held fully responsible for it until it is passed on to the next owner, and the garage where the car is traded in should be made fill in the forms in the presence of the person who is trading it in. I am sure that very few people in Dublin know that if one has a car one wants to get rid of, one can drive it to Hammond Lane in Pigeonhouse Road and they will crush it into three by three and one does not have to pay anything for it. That is something that might be broadcast a bit more widely.</P>
    <P>Another issue that needs to be addressed in the context of this motion relates to a report on wearing seat belts. It is scandalous that so many people do not abide by their obligation and place passengers and children in danger. I compliment the Government on bringing in regulations. <Col N="136" /> However, the public seems blissfully willing to ignore them.</P>
    <P>The positioning of speed cameras is another measure on which I compliment the Government. I have a bee in my bonnet about speed limiters on heavy goods vehicles. I drive the Dublin to Derry road morning and evening and the speed at which heavy goods vehicles travel along that road is frightening. There should be far more rigorous enforcement of the regulations relating to speeding generally but particularly by heavy goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Government is putting an unprecedented amount of the State's resources into measures to improve the lot of the elderly, it is a pity that this is the only motion the Opposition parties can come up with, and I support the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat amazed that it took the Opposition so long to put down a motion on this issue because the question of the national car test has been on the agenda for some time &ndash; it goes back to October 1996. I am amazed that the emphasis of the Fine Gael motion is on pensioners and the elderly. It has been highlighted by other speakers in the House, particularly by members of the Labour Party who have mentioned the question of low-income families, the unemployed and people who live in rural areas where there is little if any public transport.</P>
      <P>It was people from the farming community who brought this issue to my attention some months ago. One farmer told me that he has a diesel car with which he tows a small trailer that he used to bring home the odd bag of feedstuffs. He feels he is not a danger to himself or to anyone else. He would not be travelling very quickly and would not be putting lives at risk. I can see his point of view, but that is to overlook the effects on the environment, and it is not always easy to explain that aspect in the context of a rural area where there is no public transport. However, in order to comply with an EU directive on this issue, the Government decided in October 1996 to introduce car testing. Such directives may not be popular, but they have to be put into Irish law. I have a similar reaction to the EU directive on turf cutting, or peat extraction as it is properly termed. Whether one agrees with that directive, there is also a concern for the environment involved in its operation. Cars are widely used for business, social and personal reasons and they are certainly a necessity in rural areas. On the other hand there are the disadvantages of traffic congestion and the pressure on the environment.</P>
      <P>The Opposition motion contains an interesting proposal for a subsidy on motoring. Subsidies have not been provided for motoring apart from in the case of disabled drivers. Older people do not receive concessions on motor or fuel taxes. Would subsidies for car use amount to discrimination against those who are not wealthy enough to own a car? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1996, when the Government <Col N="137" /> announced the national car test, the question was not raised of subsidising the cost of the test for those on low incomes, including those on social welfare and old age pensioners. The test fee is £35 and retests cost £19.80, but what will the test fee be if subsidies are introduced? When the test was announced the Government said the matter would be self-financing. To my knowledge, other EU member states do not operate any subsidy scheme for old age pensioners or social welfare recipients. No other member state has motor car subsidies for people in rural areas where public transport is not widely available. We should have a subsidy but I do not believe it is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1996 the Government stressed the principle of a self-financing service and a very strong case was made for that. Granting a subsidy for older persons would almost certainly generate claims for similar concessions to other categories such as, for example, those in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Another part of the motion refers to subsidising private car repair costs which would involve a major policy change and would run counter to the principle of private responsibility for such costs. How much would that subsidy amount to? Yesterday, the Minister said one could be talking about subsidies of up to £10,000 for individual car repairs. The scheme as proposed by the Opposition would be unfair to people who cannot afford to run a car. As the Minister said, car ownership and use has always involved significant private costs. The Automobile Association estimates £5,000 to £6,000 as the total annual cost of running a small to medium sized car. Some 15% of that figure, in the region of £800 to £900, relates to servicing and parts replacement to ensure that the vehicle remains in good condition and safe running order.</P>
      <P>There have been justified complaints about the fact that some people have to travel long distances to test centres. Perhaps the Government will look at this issue in future as more and more cars will be tested. The emphasis should be on lights, brakes, steering, tyres and seat belts about which there has been some comment in today's newspapers. Surveys show that only 50% of drivers use seat belts. It is interesting to note, however, that where drivers give an example by using their seat belt, the other occupants of the car are likely to follow suit.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should introduce legislation as soon as possible to permit more equitable driver licence fee arrangements for persons aged 70 or over. This point is referred to in the Opposition motion and I welcome it. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, answered the issue in a positive way recently at Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister exempted the national car test for car owners living on most of our islands and that is a welcome development. We usually help those <Col N="138" /> who live on small islands, whether it concerns house building or, in this case, car testing. I also welcome the fact that the Minister has exempted vintage cars from the test. I have tried and failed to answer the case made by some undertakers who want hearses included as vintage cars. According to the undertakers, hearses are often vintage vehicles with low mileage. Their owners are usually involved in small businesses and cannot compete with the big undertakers in larger towns and cities. Some undertakers have told me that they must take a car apart to convert it into a hearse and they feel this is a good example of a vintage car. Perhaps the Minister could re-examine that situation.</P>
    <P>As we improve our roads and dual carriageways, and new motorways are introduced, speed will be a major issue. Measures must be taken to reduce speed and in particular I welcome the installation of fixed cameras to record speeding vehicles. Gardaí cannot be on duty all the time and such cameras have proved to be successful. They should be introduced more widely as the road network is further developed. In addition to these cameras, I hope we will continue the campaigns against drink driving. Failure to use seat belts should be dealt with by on-the-spot fines, and penalty points should also be employed to disqualify drivers who repeatedly break the law.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, said in the debate yesterday and I support the Government's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person who is involved in the transport business, I welcomed the introduction of the car testing scheme. In my years in the business I saw that the introduction of tests on heavy goods vehicles raised the standards of such vehicles, thus ensuring the safety of commercial vehicles currently in operation. There are issues concerning that kind of commercial activity that need to be looked at, including the gearing and proper fitting of tachographs to ensure they are not cut off during the day and so comply with the legal requirements. While that law is in place there are ways and means of getting over it. Given the poor safety levels on our roads it is high time we ensured that manufacturers of commercial vehicles maintain the standards dictated to them by the Department and are not allowed to interfere with the mechanisms. We must insist that manufacturers ensure there is a sealed mechanism that cannot be interfered with. The testing of cars is a natural follow on from that. I commend the last Government for deciding to introduce it and this Government for introducing this system. In time, car testing will improve the safety levels of cars in use and will ensure that in future, the number of poor quality cars is lowered until they are gone from the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, an indication of the public's view of motor safety is given in figures published today which show, in a random check, that only half of drivers use safety belts. That tells us something <Col N="139" /> about the public and it is incumbent on us as legislators to ensure that legislation is enforced to the letter of the law by the Garda or any other body charged with enforcing it. I support the Government, but there is no doubt that the car testing scheme has created difficulties for people, particularly people in rural Ireland who may have been using an old vehicle safely until now. The machines that test these cars are so accurate that to pass the test, old cars must reach an almost impossible standard. Also, some garages repairing cars do not have equipment that can ensure the standard required by the test for car emissions is reached. Garages will have to ensure their equipment is up to speed so that they are in synchronisation with the equipment in the test centres, otherwise some cars which have failed the test will find it hard to meet the standards required to pass, as is happening. We must look at this matter while retaining the existing standards.</P>
    <P>I believe pensioners and those on social welfare would bear with the cost of the test, but there is also the cost of repairing the car if it is far below the standard required. There is a great deal of talk now about public private partnerships and we should consult the motor industry about this. That industry is very quick to contact us about its budget requirements and it would not be any harm to consult it on this matter. There will have to be innovative schemes put in place by people in this business to accommodate pensioners and others who will have to have their cars improved.</P>
    <P>No matter what we do, we should always factor in the possibility easing costs for pensioners; that should be the norm. All too often legislation is passed which increases costs for old age pensioners and the increase is almost always taken away from them with Government assistance. As a result of this scheme, motor parts factories and motor dealers and agents are experiencing an increase in sales. Extra parts are being bought and cars have to be brought up to a higher standard. The least they could do in terms of a public private partnership, to put it loosely, is to come up with a scheme to deal with the cost of trading in a car that does not come up to scratch. They should have some form of innovative scheme to deal with this. Some dealers advertise such schemes, but they have not gone into the matter in much detail. These people are doing very well out of an economy built by today's old age pensioners and they should contribute significantly by coming up with an imaginative scheme, perhaps in partnership with the Government, to enable people's cars to pass this test. If it was done as a once-off, as the car test becomes part of the norm, car standards will rise and there will not be the same amount of difficulty in coming years. That is a challenge for all of us and particularly those making the most out of the economy. I challenge that sector to come up with a scheme such as the one I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Regarding road speed, it is essential that every <Col N="140" /> authority involved, particularly the Garda, takes notice of the horrendous accidents on the roads due to nothing other than speed or carelessness. If we take action in this regard, coupled with the testing of cars, we will make our roads much safer than they are now.</P>

      <P>There is no shortage of speakers. I am totally opposed to car testing. We would be much better off making the roads car worthy. I have constituents in north Mayo who must travel to Ballina and Westport to get their cars tested. If their cars are perfect leaving Belmullet, by the time they reach Castlebar they will fail because the road from Castlebar to Belmullet is so bad.</P>
      <P>Councillor Gerry Coyle has contacted me on many occasions as to why the people of Erris have to travel to Ballina or Castlebar when Erris is as big as County Louth. The Government obliged Deputy Healy-Rae by setting up sub-stations. I want a sub-station for the people of north Mayo. We are great in this country for EU regulations, but the first job should be to get the roads in good working order. Then we can have car testing.</P>
      <P>We do not have the DART or Luas in rural Ireland; some areas do not have a train service. Rural people depend on their cars. I know a man in Porturlin who has not been in Castlebar or Westport for 35 years and who does not know the road to these places. He uses his car every Friday to go to Belmullet for his pension and his groceries and then he goes home. That man will not kill anyone. His car is approximately 12 years old and he cannot afford a new one because the Celtic tiger has not reached north Mayo yet.</P>
      <P>This test should not have been introduced. Why do we always have to be first to implement European regulations? France, Germany and other countries push them aside and pretend to bring in a scheme. We are great for implementing regulations. When the Government was trying to get us into Europe, we were promised one thing: we were promised that if we joined the European Union, we would be able to buy a car in France, Germany, Dublin or Cork for the same price and that additional taxes would not be levied. I challenge the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government to tell us whether that is happening. They got around that EU regulation and introduced their own taxes. This is an attack on rural Ireland. I heard the Minister of State defending rural Ireland on many occasions. However, he let rural Ireland down on this and the people of rural Ireland will not forget it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw attention to a point raised by Deputy Carey which I support and urge the Minister to take on board. It is criminal that <Col N="141" /> young people can buy cars from reputable car dealers in this city and use them for joy riding. Lives have been lost through that.</P>
      <P>Which comes first, the car or the road? Is there any point in people spending substantial amounts of money on their cars only to find they are not any better off when they return home from the garage? I am aware of one instance in which a car was found to be out of line in spite of the fact that the car had been properly aligned and rendered road worthy by a reputable and registered mechanic. The person returned home from the car test and brought his car back to the mechanic who tested it again and found that it was out of line. It was out of line because of the condition of the roads on which the person had to travel between the time he got his car aligned by the mechanic and the time it was tested. The man succeeded in getting his car to pass the test by having it realigned by the mechanic and only driving on the main road until it was due to be re-tested. That is an outrageous situation.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a second case in which a car was failed because its brakes were found to be faulty in spite of the fact that its owner spent £500 prior to the test to ensure the car was road worthy I wrote to the Minister outlining the name of the car owner and the registration number of the car. The car failed the test because the man had to drive through deep craters along the road on his way to the car testing centre from which water got into the lining of his brakes.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government have failed to provide sufficient money to make road conditions adequate for cars and are blaming and penalising motorists. I regret to say that Cavan has the highest rate of car test failures in the country with some 75% of cars failing the test. Seventy five per cent of cars in Cavan are failing not because they are unworthy &ndash; they are excellent and safe cars &ndash; but because of road conditions.</P>
      <P>In spite of the so-called Celtic tiger, roads funding has decreased from a 14% annual increase level when Fine Gael was in Government to the current 7% level of increase which, at a 4% inflation rate, is less than 3% in real terms. That is not sufficient. The Government should leave the old people of this country alone. They built this country for us and created the happy situation in which we find ourselves today. The very least to which they are entitled are their cars to take them to town or to church at weekends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in deploring the excessive burden placed on pensioners by the national car test. The extra costs involved will severely restrict the mobility and independence of many pensioners and elderly people. For many pensioners, a car is not a luxury but a necessity which allows them to complete some very simple but essential tasks, which many people take for granted but which are vital to everyday existence. By not allowing pensioners to complete these <Col N="142" /> tasks, the national car test is limiting their independence and putting them in shackles.</P>
      <P>The majority of pensioners use their cars to perform some very basic, everyday tasks. They use them to go to the grocery shop, attend church and to visit the doctor or families and friends. This new charge will make it extremely difficult for pensioners to complete these simple, yet vital, tasks. It will force the elderly to seek assistance which would simply not be needed if the charge were not imposed. In other words, it will undermine elderly people's independence. Very few people do not value their independence. People enjoy taking care of themselves and do not like to seek assistance or burden people when it is not necessary. The new costs associated with the national car test will severely limit the independence of pensioners who will be forced to swallow their pride and seek assistance which would be completely unnecessary if they were exempted from the charge.</P>
      <P>The new fee will have a particularly disastrous effect in rural Ireland in which a car is vital for many people's day to day survival. The public transport, if any, in rural areas is often inadequate. The new fee will deprive pensioners of a link to the outside world. They will be cut off from their families and friends and it will be impossible for them to engage in their customary daily activities.</P>
      <P>Many elderly people survive on a very limited income. They are retired and survive on their pensions. These people have invested years of hard work in this country and should now be enjoying the fruits of their labour without being unduly burdened by an unfair charge on their vehicles.</P>
      <P>Some elderly people have difficulty getting around even with a car. Many are limited physically due to periods of hospitalisation or illness. It is disgraceful to further shackle these people and further limit their mobility. We owe something to the people who helped Ireland become what it is today. It would be a very humane gesture to follow the proposals outlined in this motion and exempt old age pensioners from this charge. Such a gesture would not go unnoticed by many pensioners and elderly people in rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national car test would be acceptable if our roads were better and if it were carried out in conjunction with other necessary road safety measures. Two major factors contribute to fatal accidents and serious injuries. I refer to speed and drink driving. The number of old age pensioners convicted of either speeding or drink driving could be counted on the fingers of one hand. It is vital that old age pensioners are allowed to maintain mobility for as long as possible. They should be able to manage their own affairs in a dignified way without having to depend on others for help. The trip to town, to church, to visit grandchildren or for a drive country is sheer bliss for elderly people. One could say <Col N="143" /> that their cars are their guardian angels without which they are condemned to limbo. Many older cars are in good general shape and can be driven safely at low speeds.</P>
      <P>I will cite the example of a couple in north Galway who are in receipt of the old age non-contributory pension and who own a 1989 registered car which is in reasonably good condition. The couple use the car to drive the three miles to mass every morning. They drive to the post office every Friday to collect their pensions and they visit their married son, who lives eight miles away, a few times a week. As their son is often out of the country, they would not be able to see their grandchildren at all if they did not have a car.</P>
      <P>The couple brought the car to a local mechanic last week in preparation for the test and were told that it would cost £650 to carry out the work necessary for the car to pass. These people do not have £650 and are unlikely to get it soon. Consequently, they will be off the road in a couple of weeks' time. Trips to the hospital will have to be paid for and the cost to the State of servicing people like this couple will rise quickly. Some financial assistance should be available to such people. We managed to provide a £1,000 scrappage fee to every Tom, Dick and Harry in recent years so why can we not do something for pensioners who depend on their cars for their remaining years?</P>

      <P>I am amazed that the Government, having off-loaded money to various organisations and interest groups in the past six months, has turned on the elderly. Other speakers have highlighted the impact of this test on the elderly. Many elderly people living in rural areas do not have access to free travel which is readily available to their urban peers and use the free transport system once or twice a year. It is a sad reflection on the Government that at a time when the Celtic tiger is roaring, the Government should impose this fee on the elderly so they will not be able to use their cars. Other speakers have referred to the elderly who go to town to do their shopping or collect their pensions. In those circumstances, it would be a humane gesture if the Government reconsidered this fee and accepted this motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister lives in a rural area and travels across the country weekly. He must have seen elderly people travelling to do their shopping and surely he knows their plight. As regards the pollution caused by people whose cars do not pass the test, they probably do not drive more than 3,000 or 4,000 miles per year and the threat they represent to the environment is minimal. I appeal to the Minister to accept the motion.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy O'Keeffe. I have no problem with car testing for safety purposes. However, if one goes out to the gates of this House, one can see the <Col N="144" /> Government subsidised buses of Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann driving past. If they were put through the same rigorous test, how many of them would be on the road? The school bus fleet is a shambles. The elderly would bear the cost of car testing more easily if we showed by example that we were serious about road safety. Nobody would complain about people, old or young, being in charge of a vehicle with good brakes, steering, tyres, lights and so on. However, that is where it should end.</P>
      <P>Some of the media went over the top when this test was introduced. They gave every reason under the sun, some of which I believe were fictitious, for failing the test. This led to terror among senior citizens with old cars who were called for this test. They did not only have to pay for the test, but also a pre-test service, without knowing if the car would fail and they would have to be tested again. I saw a 1984 car being tested, and a 1993 car was immediately before it. It failed the test because smoke emanated from it. The owner was told that if he had revved the car in third gear he would have passed the test. The owner asked if he could try again but was told to come back and pay another fee. This indicates how unsound the concept is. It is important that the fee is readjusted in favour of the elderly living in isolated areas.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy O'Keeffe. The disabled as well as pensioners should be relieved of this fee. Many disabled people are entitled to tax relief on new cars to enable them to travel in comfort but this is difficult to obtain because of the technicalities involved. The cost of repairs to cars is huge. As previous speakers said, this is scaring those who cannot afford them. While pensioners received an increase of £18 in the past three budgets, the disabled received £10.</P>
      <P>Many of these people are living in rural areas, such as Cavan and Monaghan which I represent. They have bus passes but they cannot use them because there is no bus service. They must use a car to collect their pensions, go to mass and shop or else pay for a taxi. This cost of a taxi can be too much if they live far away from a taxi base. Has any research been conducted on the cause of accidents? I suggest that the majority of accidents which we have unfortunately heard of in the past week, month or six months, involved newer and brand new cars travelling long distances. Few accidents involve cars which might fail the test.</P>

Given the roar of the Celtic tiger, this Government needs to spend the <Col N="145" /> required money on our roads. I ask the Minister to look at this matter again. Monaghan County Council passed a resolution that the fee should be abolished. The Minister cannot ignore the anxieties of the elderly and those living in rural areas.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I plead with the Minister to rethink this heartless and insensitive application of a fee to old age pensioners who in many cases have few assets other than the family car. I agree with the concept of the test. However, the fee is the problem. No speakers have asked that a subvention be given to pensioners or anyone else to grant aid the cost of repairs. We are asking the Government to look at the application and examination fees. In rural constituencies such as my constituency of Laois-Offaly, where there is no alternative, elderly people are being forced off the roads. We do not have a web of public transportation services in counties Laois or Offaly that will provide an alternative when the family vehicle is forced off the road as a result of the application of the test. The failure rate for cars is high at in excess of 60%. Bad roads were referred to by other speakers and this is a valid point. It seems to me that the Minister of State has imposed northern European conditions on Irish society where the road structure is totally different from that which exists in many Nordic countries.</P>
      <P>It seems to have gone unnoticed to those drafting this proposal that the value of a car which needs to undergo a test has been entirely wiped out. These cars are worthless. Garages will not give a quote for a car which is eight, nine or ten years old. This means that a family asset has, in effect, become a liability.</P>
      <P>A strong case can be made to exempt hearses, particularly in rural areas. Many of these vehicles are old, have high mileage on the clock and are in need of some form of renovation, otherwise they will fail the test. There is a strong case to be made for the introduction of a scrappage scheme for hearses such as in the case of motor vehicles in recent years. The cost of a hearse is substantial. I understand it can be in the order of £40,000 and rural undertakers in particular are not in a position to refurbish these vehicles.</P>
      <P>It is fundamentally wrong to impose European autobahn standards for Irish roads. Autobahn standards are not applicable to the rural areas of Laois and Offaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter a few weeks ago during Question Time when the Minister of State told me there was not a history of subvention on private motoring in Ireland. I beg to differ, because the scrappage scheme which was in place recently was a subvention on private motoring. I represent in the main a rural constituency where there is very little public transport. This means elderly people cannot avail easily of the <Col N="146" /> free travel pass. The cost of motoring has increased. The Minister for Finance neglected to do anything in the budget to alleviate this problem. The Minister of State is now imposing a cost of approximately one-third to a half of an older person's weekly income to do this test. There is also the possibility of having to repeat the test and having to carry out essential repairs on the car. The effect of this will be to drive older people, particularly in rural areas, off the road. This will add to the isolation and loneliness many older people encounter. I submit that if the Minister had thought of this earlier, he may have included a provision in the Bill to enable older people to have this cost waived and to receive some assistance. I appeal to him at this late stage to do so. The poor, the elderly, those on social welfare and the disabled must be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The roads in rural areas in particular are in a dreadful condition. This will add to the misery in rural Ireland. Many older people are worried that their cars will fail the test. I ask the Minister of State to take positive action to help the elderly, the poor and those who are worried their cars will be taken from them and that they will be isolated and more lonely as a result. This is a dreadful situation. I have met people who are very worried. Perhaps as a result of this debate the Minister of State will do something positive in this regard. I am sure his heart is in the right place and that he will.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. I have no difficulty with the concept of car testing which I believe is necessary. However, I represent the rural constituency of Sligo-Leitrim where there are many elderly people whose only means of transport is the car as there is no public transport service. Many people who live on small farms have old cars and do not have the wherewithal to buy new cars or to repair old cars. The Government should consider introducing a waiver for these people because there are few of them throughout the country and the amount of driving they do is very little. They would probably travel to Mass on Saturday evening or Sunday morning and to town once or twice a year. It is extremely important that they are taken into consideration. When the Government decided to introduce car testing it did not take them into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is different in Galway city, the Minister of State's constituency, or in any urban area where there is a major public transport service and a car is not a necessity. In rural areas, where there is a necessity for car transport for the elderly in particular, the view expressed by the Government is incorrect. It has not thought out this proposal but introduced legislation which was purported to come from the European Union. Everything which comes from Brussels is not necessarily good. We must introduce legislation to suit the people we represent. The Government should introduce a waiver scheme so that pensioners over the age of 66 will not have to take <Col N="147" /> their cars to the NCT centre for testing. Free travel passes for buses and trains is of no benefit to the elderly in Counties Leitrim and Sligo, which I represent, because they need a car to get to the public transport services. It would be seen as a very decent and humane act if the Minister of State were to introduce a waiver for car testing for anyone over the age of 65.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the generally supportive tone of the contributions to this debate on the introduction of a national car test and the acceptance of the Government's undertaking to change the driving licence fee regime for older people so that an existing inequity is removed. There is a general consensus that we should not allow unsafe cars to be driven on the roads and this is what I would expect. Some Members remarked that vehicle defects may make a relatively small contribution to road traffic accidents but even a marginal contribution cannot be welcomed.   </P>
      <P>The objective of the NCT is to identify those unsafe vehicles in order to increase safety for all road users. Some Deputies stated that certificates of road worthiness are being refused for trivial reasons and examples of this have been given. This is not true. However, some mistaken media reports may have contributed to this type of confusion. It is important to note that where an &ldquo;advisory&rdquo; item fails the test, the owner is given a certificate of road worthiness. It is only when a primary safety critical item fails that a certificate is refused. Experience to date with the NCT indicates that this is usually because of dangerously poor brakes.</P>
      <P>The main area of contention is that the real burden of the NCT test will arise from repair bills some older people may have to face and in order to avoid forcing many older citizens off the road, the Government should give a subsidy towards the purchase of a replacement car. It is estimated that approximately 165,000 people of 65 years of age and older are currently insured to drive cars. On the basis that approximately 78% of all cars are more than four years old and are due to be tested, approximately 129,000 people could, in theory, be eligible for a subsidy of up to £10,000 each. One does not have to be a mathematician to understand that the Government would be faced with impossible demands. The relief operated by the Revenue and offered to disabled drivers is taken up by approximately 5,400 disabled persons. It is obvious that the two schemes are not comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In no other European Union country is a public subsidy, as proposed, available. It is recognised in all fellow EU member states that it is a personal responsibility to meet private motoring costs. The introduction of car testing was not seen as a reason to introduce subsidies for older car owners. The attitude taken in the motion is populist, but it is without precedence even in those <Col N="148" /> countries with the widest social protection schemes.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies said it is more important to make progress on the primary targets and policies of the Government's road safety strategy. Substantial improvements in road safety have taken place over the past two years. A total of 3% fewer people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997, while 12% fewer people were seriously injured in 1998 compared to 1997. This represents the lowest number of serious injuries for the last decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target in the Government's strategy for road safety of at least a 20% reduction by 2002 relative to 1997. More recent provisional data from An Garda Síochána indicates that there were 413 road deaths in 1999 compared to 458 in 1998. This represents a reduction of 13% in road deaths relative to 1997 in the second full year of operation of the Government's road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to the driving test waiting list and inquired when a learner driver could get a test within a year. This is already the case. The longest waiting time is now 49 weeks and, as I already informed the House, we have increased the number of testers employed by 37, bringing the total to 101. This increases the capacity of the service to 200,000 tests per year. Improvements in waiting times and in the number waiting for tests have been realised despite the unprecedented application levels &ndash; up 5% in 1999 compared to 1998, which also had record increases. Indications this year are that this high level of applications is continuing and to meet this demand arrangements are being made to recruit additional testers. The target for the end of the year is to have waiting times generally down to ten weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government agrees with the part of the motion regarding reform of the driving licence fees structure for older people. It has taken account of the possible difficulty created for those on limited incomes, including older people who might face significant repair bills, by limiting the reasons for refusal of a test certificate to those items which are essential for safety or a healthy environment. The introduction of car testing has been responsible and equitable and will support other measures being taken to achieve the target set out in the Government's road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputies who tabled the motion that their party was in Government when the Cabinet decision was made to introduce the car test. The terms of that Government decision were that it should be introduced on a self-financing basis. To demand a change of that nature when the succeeding Government does what it agreed to do then, shows a certain level of hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with the points made by Deputy Ring about the distances some people may have to travel but provision has been made for three mobile units. One is based in County Donegal, another in the Clifden area of County Galway and the third in Cahirciveen, County <Col N="149" /> Kerry. The local council can negotiate with the national car test service to bring a mobile unit, if that is deemed necessary, to facilitate people in Belmullet or other distant regions. However, more than 90% of car owners are within 30 miles of a car testing centre. This criterion was laid down in the contract and is being met.</P>

      <P>I do not regard the motion as hypocritical, rather as timely. The Minister of State's comment would be understandable if the car test had been introduced in a situation where there were ideal roads. However, many of the people on whom the road test is impacting live in rural locations and only use cars for minor journeys. They also usually have older cars for economic reasons and because of the condition of the roads.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's colleague spends more than £0.5 million on public relations but I could take him on a public relations tour of County Limerick and show him the condition of some of the roads there. I could show him a big pothole on a national primary route outside Raheen where 20 cars were badly damaged, being driven by people coming from work at 8 a.m. When the people concerned went to the council to seek compensation for expenditure up to £300, they were told that such money could not be paid. This happened on a national primary route and one should contrast this with the position in other European countries. Most of those countries have a different road network.</P>
      <P>Outside a funeral parlour recently I was abused over the introduction of the car test because of the condition of the roads in the area. All politicians were blamed for its introduction and there was no point in me trying to validate my argument by saying that the test was introduced on foot of an EU directive. We have a habit of conforming with EU directives rather than deviating from them but in terms of the repairs which are necessary under the car test, most of the problems with braking systems, steering, axles, wheels and tyres are associated with the type of roads.</P>
      <P>Rather than being hypocritical, the motion asks the Government to do something worthwhile for the people the car test is affecting dramatically. The Minister of State's colleague, Independent Deputy Healy-Rae, was complaining on local radio in Kerry recently about the EU directive and the roads in his area. He said what was happening was deplorable and draconian and I am interested to see how he votes this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State's comments about road safety ring hollow because funding is not provided by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the annual allocations for road works for the removal of dangerous bends on regional and county roads. I am aware of <Col N="150" /> bends on roads where people have been killed and I have raised the matter at council level, but I have been told that funding is not available to remove such bends. The Government should get its priorities right in relation to road safety and do things properly before it introduces other measures similar to the car test.</P>

      <P>I will be in trouble with my '88 Micra which gets me around. I was told by the local garage that it needs £800 of work for it to pass the car test. I am a widow as I lost my husband 16 years ago. I am rearing six young children and I am unable to buy a car. The poor person is getting done again and no one is standing up for them. I will be grounded in the middle of nowhere. I am scared like many more who cannot afford to change their cars.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies have received similar letters.</P>
      <P>The vehicle has been identified as a contributory factor in only 1% of accidents. It is unbelievable that the Government is planning to increase investment at one end of the system in the enforcement of speeding regulations and the introduction of the national car test while, at the other, it is sitting on its hands and observing the increasing flow into the system of inexperienced and untested motorists. The driving test has not been reviewed for 20 years and it is not reflective of today's traffic or modern road and vehicle engineering.</P>
      <P>If the Government is serious about its campaign to combat speeding, a points system similar to that in the UK should be introduced. The current £50 fine is prohibitive for some, but it is a paltry figure to many who drive high powered cars. The Minister has also failed to regulate driving instructors. Many of them do not have any qualifications and they can pass on their own bad driving habits to future generations of drivers. The Consumers' Association of Ireland claims that tighter training standards for drivers would help to reduce the number of road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current situation where a provisional driver can get insurance and drive a car without any knowledge of the rules of the road is unacceptable. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has failed to introduce a new driving theory test which would help combat this problem. Drivers who possess provisional licences are neither required to take lessons or to take a driving test for up to four years following receipt of the first provisional licence. We have continued to ignore the fact that first provisional licence drivers are breaking the law by not ensuring that a qualified driver accompanies them at all times. The provisional licence has become as flexible as the full licence without any sign of restriction. As more young drivers than ever take to the roads the need for driver training becomes more imperative. If the Government is serious about stopping road carnage it must provide driv<Col N="151" /> ing testers, regulate driving instruction and reform the driving test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to the car test. However, it is unfair that those over the age of 70 are charged more for their driving licences than the younger members of the community. The three year licence should be granted free of charge, not at an extra cost. The elderly should be encouraged to remain mobile, not penalised for their age. Age can be hurtful. Many old people find they need a medical certificate and are restricted to a three year licence. They resent this reminder of passing years but are rightly incensed that they are charged more for their licence than others and an additional cost for the medical certificate. These costs should not exist.</P>
      <P>The State should fund the cost of the medical and grant the licence on a no-fee basis. Having driven for years and paid driving licence charges it is not unreasonable that this small concession be made to help people retain their independence. This is an additional burden on their finances and the cost of submitting their cars for testing is too much. Elderly people, struggling to make ends meet cannot reasonably be expected to meet this payment, a cost which would take food from many an elderly person's plate as they skimp to gather the tax. There is a fear that these people, having denied themselves small comforts, will be told their trusty old pal is only fit for the scrap yard.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy towards the elderly in respect of driving is such as to create further social isolation for these people. It would be more appropriate if the Government sought ways of encouraging these people, whom it discriminates against, to be more interactive with the community while retaining their independence. For many, the car is the only way they can get out of the house to go to the Church, shops or a simple outing such as a bingo session. Given their long years of experience and their great knowledge many senior citizens provide excellent community services by working for their communities through resident's associations and senior citizens' groups. They need a car to get to these meetings and groups.</P>
      <P>The Government must find ways to support this segment of society. This motion recognises there are practical things the State can do to help the elderly improve the quality and safety of their lives, while conforming to the sensible approach of ensuring safety for all.</P>

      <P>I agree that the national car test is a good scheme and was introduced with the best of intentions. Therefore, the Government should support the motion. We, the Opposition, are merely bringing to its attention the difficulties as its affects the elderly. It would show a sense of maturity not only on the part of the Government but a sense of caring for the elderly <Col N="152" /> and a concern to get the scheme right, were it to accept the motion.</P>
      <P>It would be no big climb-down were the Minister to accept the realistic and logical recommendations in the motion. We should not be indifferent to the concerns of the elderly. We should realise and accept that with age comes insecurity. Any measures that cause strain and stress and increase the feeling of insecurity among the elderly must be addressed. The problem can be easily solved. The recommendations in the motion would not only solve the problem but would enable the elderly to comply with the national car test regulations. The elderly in rural areas can be affected by this scheme. They survive either on pensions or on social welfare payments and any additional cost is of concern to them.   Statistics show that older drivers are not the main cause of accidents on our roads. We want to ensure the elderly can comply with the scheme without too much of a burden.</P>
      <P>Despite an assurance of an increase in the number of driving testers, there are 1,747 people on the waiting list in south Tipperary. The average waiting time for a test is six months. Given that we cannot cope with a practical test how will we cope with the waiting list when the written examination is introduced? The failure rate, which I am sure is no different elsewhere, is 48% in south Tipperary. There should be an investigation into the reasons so many fail their driving tests.</P>

Some Government speakers implied there was no way the Government would be allowed to assist. That is not true. The previous Government, which has been out of office for the past two and a half years, was also blamed.

      <P>I have also heard there is no precedent for support for private motoring. It could also be said there was no precedent for free electricity allowance, free telephone rental and free television licences before they were introduced. There is a precedent already in relation to private motoring in the limited scheme for the disabled which we discussed with the Minister today. One can search around for excuses. If the Minister cares a jot for the elderly he will put a system in place which will give them some support. Anyone who does not support our motion is showing indifference to the elderly of rural Ireland and will take the consequences of that action.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill which gives effect to the Government's commitments outlined in the budget and is completely in line with the programme for Government. This is the most generous budget ever and, as such, it is hard to listen to some of the criticism from the opposite side of the House. It is very difficult not to welcome a budget which gives £1 billion in personal taxation deductions, removes 70,000 from the tax net and takes 125,000 taxpayers off the top rate of tax, cuts the standard and high rates of tax by 2%, reforms and simplifies capital acquisitions tax which is long overdue, accelerates capital allowances for expenditure on child care premises, puts into effect a new town renewal scheme which will be of huge benefit to many rural communities, particularly in County Mayo, and gives continued relief from stamp duty on transfers of assets to young trained farmers for a further three years which has been widely welcomed within the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is very comprehensive and, as such, it is not possible to speak in detail on all sections. I will therefore focus on a number of issues. On personal taxation, I welcome in particular the cut of 2% in the standard rate of tax to 22% and in the high rate to 44%. I also welcome the widening of the tax bands for a single person from £14,000 to £17,000 and for two income couples to £34,000. These are the most <Col N="157" /> generous reductions and changes in the tax bands that we have seen for many years and are completely in line with the commitments given in the programme for Government. I further welcome the increases in personal allowances at the standard rate of £500 for a single person and £1,000 for a married couple. A single person can now earn an income of £110 and not pay any tax.</P>
      <P>Everybody is a winner as a result of the budget. The Minister has been very caring in his attitude and also helped the aged, the blind, widows, dependent relatives and incapacitated children who will have their standard rated personal allowances doubled. These are very welcome changes and I compliment the Minister on benefiting all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes in relation to capital gains tax. Last year there was huge criticism from the opposite side of the House when the Minister reduced the rate of capital gains tax to 20%. Many argued at the time that it would result in a smaller tax take in this area but they have been proved incorrect. The Minister was correct in what he stated in last year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy recognises just how effective the Minister for Finance has been. I am sure that will mean a great deal to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone further this year and extended that 20% rate for people who wish to sell land for residential purposes. This is an important move because it will go a long way toward increasing the supply of land for housing. This is something to which the Government has been particularly committed. There will be 22,000 new house starts over the next four years and that will go a long way towards addressing the serious demand for housing. One hears hollow comments from the Opposition benches. When it comes to heckling they are excellent, but when it comes to putting forward real solutions to problems sadly their suggestions fall far short of the mark.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been unfairly criticised over the past number of weeks on his tax strategy. He has tried to introduce a simple system of taxation where the person who is out earning will attract the allowances and also must pay the tax on what is earned as an individual. This is a simple approach. It is streamlined and non-bureaucratic. It would be a welcome development in any tax system. The Minister has been unfairly treated in many sections of the media and by Members of the Opposition on this particular measure.</P>

      <P>With the passage of time as reflected in opinion polls which were in the newspaper only this week, the general public is begin<Col N="158" /> ning to realise that the changes being implemented by the Minister are significant and he was correct in what he has tried to do.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes in mortgage interest relief. Again this provides for a much simpler system than that which existed in the past. I am delighted that many of the complications with which the Revenue has had to deal over the years, not only those related to mortgage relief but those related to VHI relief also, have been taken away from it, and that those will be deducted at source. I welcome this move as it streamlines the entire tax system.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight section 12, the £3,000 carer's allowance for spouses caring for children, the incapacitated and the aged. I welcome this allowance. It is a true recognition by the Minister of those people in society who are looking after children, the incapacitated and the aged. It will provide a great deal of help to people who must stay at home and look after people in those particular categories. I compliment the Minister for introducing that measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 52 deals with the area of accelerated capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child care premises. I welcome this genuine attempt by the Minister for Finance to increase the number of child care places. This matter has been on the political agenda. It has been a high priority for Fianna Fáil and it was included in the programme for Government. I am delighted the Minister introduced this measure in the Bill. It will go a long way towards increasing the supply and, hopefully, reducing the cost to parents who must put their children in crèches and child care facilities.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the new town renewal scheme in section 72 has been warmly welcomed by all sides of the House. Many sections have been criticised, but at least there seems to be uniformity on this particular measure. It provides for relief for the renewal and the improvement of certain towns throughout the State the populations of which are between 500 and 6,000. This is a welcome development, particularly for someone like me living in a rural community. There would be many towns in County Mayo which would fall within this category. The selection process to decide on the towns concerned has already been undertaken by all the counties, and the recommendations of the various local authorities are being considered by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the scheme will operate for a three year period, between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2003. I hope it will provide genuine assistance to all of those towns in restoring and improving their fabric, but it will also promote sensitive local development and revitalise the centre of small towns. For one reason or another over the years the centres of many small towns <Col N="159" /> have fallen into dereliction. Many people have tended to move out of town centres into rural areas. I welcome this scheme as a real opportunity to regenerate some of those urban centres, particularly in my county where there were 11 towns applying for five places in this particular scheme. It would have been wonderful if all 11 towns could have qualified. As it happens, there are towns like Knock, Crossmolina, Ballyhaunis, Charlestown, Killala, Swinford and Kiltimagh in County Mayo which satisfy all the criteria for inclusion, and it is pity the Minister could not have allowed an unlimited number of towns to qualify for these benefits. All those towns equally deserve an opportunity of regenerating themselves and giving a real opportunity to the people living there. However, I welcome the development. I hope that at the end of the three year period the Minister will consider &ndash; I know this is already in his plan &ndash; the extension of the plan in order that a new set of towns may be included next time around.</P>
    <P>One of the most important sections relates to capital acquisitions tax. Deputy Ulick Burke will probably not want to remember that it was former Minister Richie Ryan of his party who introduced the tax, stating that inheritance tax was to be a tax on the rich. As all Deputies will be aware, however, what started off as a supposed tax on the rich ended up being a tax on virtually everybody, irrespective of income. It affected many people on relatively small incomes who had been living in family homes and were forced into selling the family home to pay inheritance tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister heralded for a long time that he would make major changes in this area. Therefore, it was of no surprise to us on this side of the House that the Opposition spokesperson decided to jump the gun in a bid to get a little publicity on this measure and tried to come out with a few recommendations prior to the announcement of the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister adopted them all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>However, full credit is due to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for taking the issue of CAT by the scruff of the neck once and for all and doing something about it. The changes being introduced by the Minister will reduce the severe impact of inheritance tax on family inheritances in particular. It will make business and agricultural relief more available and move the basis of gift and inheritance tax from domicile to residence. That is an important move. One used say that one's domicile was wherever one's burial plot was. It is more significant to base the tax on where the person is resident, particularly if the person is resident in a state for a period of five consecutive tax years. I welcome that change in the area of CAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 provides for an increase in inheritance tax thresholds and the introduction of the uniform 20% rate of tax for both gifts and inherit<Col N="160" /> ances. Again this is a streamlining of the tax system. It is something which the Minister has tried to introduce not just to the area of inheritance tax but, as I said earlier, to the area of personal taxation. In many other countries a streamlining and simplification of the tax system which is not bureaucratic, such as that which the Minister is trying to introduce, has been a great success. Over the years for some extraordinary reasons Ireland has managed to cobble together the most extraordinary tax system and it must be broken down and simplified. What the Minister has done this year is a huge step in that direction. In five years, or probably sooner, people on the Opposition benches and the public will be welcoming his radical move to do something at this time. As the House will be aware, it is a brave Minister who makes radical change. It seems to be always left to this side of the House to make those moves. I compliment the Minister for having the good sense to be able to take that on at this time. I also welcome the fact that on probate tax the threshold for exemption tax is now £40,000. That threshold was far too low at its previous level.</P>
    <P>Section 130 provides for the new relief of inheritance tax on the family home, as promised. That is a very important development. I know it is welcomed by all sides of the House as we have all had representations from many of our constituents. I do not think anybody intended that a brother, sister or a daughter living in a family home would have to sell the family home to pay inheritance tax. That was not the intention and I am glad it has been sorted out once and for all by this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an exemption in the Bill if one uses low surplus fuel. I welcome the tax relief for films for five years because it has been shown in the past that this has promoted further investment in the film industry. I also welcome the relief for post-graduate fees under section 21.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many excellent provisions in this Finance Bill. It is a continuation of the good work already done by this Government and Minister and by previous ones. I welcome the continuing reduction in taxation. According to a recent international survey by Forbes, we now have one of the lowest taxation regimes in the world. Unfortunately, this is a message we are failing to communicate. The view still persists that we are a heavily taxed country which is, in many instances, deterring our people from returning home. I exhort the Minister to initiate an information campaign to dispel this erroneous view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people are fair-minded and they appreciate the success we are now enjoying. Obviously, the opinion polls clearly indicate that they rightly <Col N="161" /> associate this success with the Fianna Fáil party. I refer to the NESC five year report. It states that 1987 is recognised as a break point in contemporary features of social partnership and social cohesion in Ireland. It goes on to state that it is identified as a break point in terms of key economic and socio-economic outcomes. I need not remind the House what party was responsible for bringing about that change. We are continuing that progress with the new agreement which will be ratified by a majority of the social partners and the unions, in particular.</P>
    <P>The most significant provisions of the Bill, into which I will not go in any great detail, are the personal taxation measures which will mean that an average single person on an industrial wage will see their take home pay rise by £20 per week. For a married couple, this will mean an increase of £40 per week. This total package, the largest in the history of the State, £940 million, means that everyone is a winner. While I had my difficulties with the budget when it was first announced, the amendments made by the Minister have gone a long way to satisfy people. I have particular difficulties with individualisation of which the Minister will be well aware. I agree that couples, where both partners go out to work, have not been reaping the rewards of that work. With this budget, they will benefit greatly and deservedly so.</P>
    <P>In regard to the personal allowances, the widening of the bands and the increases in allowances mean that almost 50,000 people have been taken out of the tax net altogether. Coupled with the fact that 125,000 people have been removed from the higher rate of tax, it is very significant. These measures will benefit and reward the labour force which has helped to create the booming economy we all enjoy.</P>
    <P>The working sector has benefited. Although we had concerns when the budget was announced, now that we have seen the total package in the agreement reached, which I hope will be agreed shortly, the benefits for the lower paid are significant. Over the term of the agreement, there will be significant increases of 15% to 20% in the take home pay of individuals. That is worthwhile and means people in that bracket will have more spending power.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also benefit the sectors of society which deserve and need our help &ndash; the aged, the blind, widows, dependent relatives and incapacitated children. This group will have their standard personal allowances doubled. The total social welfare improvements will be increased to almost £400 million, the largest package in the history of the State. Total spending by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will be almost £5.4 billion, 20% above the 1997 level. Pensioners will receive an increase of £7 per week. When the increase in the qualified adult payment is taken into account, a contributory old age pensioner couple, both aged 66 or over, will receive £160 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition, families with children will also see <Col N="162" /> benefits. This Government obviously appreciates that child benefit is an important financial support for families with dependent children and a key instrument in combating child poverty. The child benefit rate for the first and second child will be increased by £8 per month and by £10 per month for the third and subsequent children. These increases will raise monthly payments to £197 for four children families. In addition, a £20 increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is also being granted. Families deserve to reap the benefits of this economic prosperity. The Minister has ensured that the means to achieve that are included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for reductions in business and other taxes. A single rate of 12.5% on trading income is to be the achievement of a schedule of corporation tax reductions. The standard rate of corporation tax at 24% on trading income is provided for in the Bill and this will have significant success in that sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides an opportunity to help the people through tax cuts and programmes which assist all sectors of society. It is obviously a very welcome Bill and now that Deputy Belton has gone I can say I understand how galling it must be to be in Opposition at a time&mdash;</P>

The enlightened approach by the Fianna Fáil Government is now paying dividends . I am sure they will share with Fianna Fáil in the success we are now reaping.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn dealt with capital acquisitions tax but there are two areas which are worthy of mention. One is donations to universities. Under section 485 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, if somebody gives at least £1,000 to certain third level institutions for particular projects, it can be written off against tax.One of the difficulties encountered, particularly in third level education, has been the amount of money put into research and development and various courses that are an adjunct to the industry we are trying to create. Since this measure was introduced in the budget, there has been major interaction between businesses and the third level sector. That can only help third level institutions and the ongoing research and development that is so important for this economy.</P>
      <P>This Bill is expansive, its measures are far-seeing and it will ensure the continued growth of the economy, which will benefit workers and the less well off in our society.</P>

      <P>While I have only a few minutes to contribute to the debate, I thank my colleagues for affording me the opportunity to do so. Having regard to the debate on this Bill and the ongoing debate on Budget 2000, those of us who have <Col N="163" /> been Members of the House for a few years could indulge in political nostalgia by thinking back to the 1980s when the economy was not in the shape it is in today. In the mid-1980s the question of whether we could avoid bankruptcy was on the lips of concerned economists.</P>
      <P> A programme of austerity was put in place by the then Government in 1987 and during the succeeding years many of those working in the areas where financial curtailment had to be effected experienced a certain degree of pain. Those who research the economic and political history of the period will be able to monitor the progress made since then and I am sure they will conclude that the decisions taken at that time paid rich dividends in the late 1990s and into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has been able to introduce significant reductions in personal taxation levels during recent years, and I hope further reductions will be introduced in future years, principally because of the significant increase in the number of people in direct employment. The programme of industrial development has been a major success. Enterprise Ireland can be justly proud of what has happened. Such success does not happen by accident. Unless the political and economic climate is favourable, investment will not materialise. When there is a lack of investment and industrial expansion, jobs do not come onstream. Jobs were created in the manufacturing sector and Exchequer investment in our educational infrastructure is paying rich dividends, but the most significant feature, which is always a barometer of the well being of an economy, has been the phenomenal growth in the number of jobs in the services sector. That is not all directly related to what is happening in the building sector. An announcement was made earlier this week that the Xerox Corporation will create more than 100 jobs in Dundalk in the injecting moulding business. That corporation is locating in Dundalk to supply its industry with its needs in that sector of the business.</P>
      <P>If one indulges in political history, one needs more than five minutes to contribute. Significant changes to inheritance tax and capital acquisitions tax have been introduced in the budget. The escalation in the valuation of family homes created financial hardship for family members in the amount of tax they were required to pay on inheriting the family home, but the changes in this area and the other adjustments to the capital acquisitions tax introduced by the Minister for Finance are welcome and they will be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that the health budget for 2000 will be approximately £4.2 billion, which represents an increase of one-third over the budgets for the past two years. That is a significant increase in an area, which by its nature involves major capital and current expenditure. I am sure <Col N="164" /> that increase will be reflected in an improved health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>While many Government speakers said this budget was the first of many give-away budgets by the Government, I remind them that this budget was the first real opportunity a Minister for Finance has had, probably in the history of this State, to bring about real change for many people, but the Minister failed to utilise that opportunity. He failed to effect real change in the taxation structure for the people who needed it most, the low paid. When Deputy Batt O'Keeffe referred to this matter, he said the less well off would benefit most from it. The record speaks for itself in that they are the people who have least to gain by the provisions of the budget. That golden opportunity was lost by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention other matters and other lost opportunities. In the previous budget the Minister introduced a welcome provision for the upper Shannon region, where he designated those areas that had found it difficult for economic reasons to attract new investment to be part of a pilot scheme. I had hoped he would extend that scheme to the middle Shannon region, south from Athlone down to Portumna and towards Woodford, but that did not happen. Even at this late stage, I hope he will reconsider extending the scheme to that area as it is one that falls between not two stools but many stools. Further south along the River Shannon basin and to the east of it runs the Shannon free zone and it continues up through Tipperary as far as Birr and being part of that is of major benefit to that area.</P>
      <P>On the western side of the Shannon, Enterprise Ireland and other agencies are based but Ireland's IDA west base in Galway has forgotten about the eastern part of the county. On last night's Adjournment Debate it was stated that Ireland's IDA had not created one manufacturing assisted job in the town of Ballinasloe in 27 years, a town which suffered the loss of 180 jobs last week. That does not apply only to Ballinasloe, most county towns in the eastern part of Country Galway have been given the same treatment. There has not been any recognition from IDA Ireland in bringing investment into the area and creating employment. That is why I ask the Minister for Finance to reconsider, as a matter of urgency, the inclusion of the middle Shannon area from Athlone southwards through Eyrecourt, Portumna and as far as Woodford on the western side of the Shannon. It would be an opportunity to bring inward development to this area that has otherwise failed to be regenerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were lucky that five towns in County Galway were designated under the new urban renewal scheme. It is a good scheme and it has been recognised as such. However, for the small towns in question in this instance, it has too many parallels with previous urban renewal schemes that benefited larger towns with extensive urban areas in decay or which had suffered decline for economic reasons or because people had moved <Col N="165" /> out. Small towns such as Loughrea and Portumna might have individual premises that have gone into ruin but do not have extensive areas that are in decay. That means there are only piecemeal opportunities for renewal. The intention was that if one were to drive through one of the towns that benefited from this new urban renewal, one would see the impact of the provisions of this scheme. Unfortunately I cannot see how we will recognise small isolated improvements that might occur. I hope this scheme will be extended in the next year to include a more extensive response in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision relating to post-graduate fees. However, I find it very difficult to reconcile that provision with what is happening at present in Galway where more than 100 undergraduate nurses are being victimised because they are unjustly and unfairly denied their fees. The sooner the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Health and Children takes responsibility and grants justice the better. This injustice should be recognised. These undergraduate nurses should be given their entitlements. They should be treated the same as all other undergraduates and their fees paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on the Finance Bill. It will be the most important legislation to be enacted this year as it details how much money will be spent in all Departments over the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>There are parts of the Finance Bill which I welcome. The provisions relating to inheritance tax are worthy, and the Minister has dealt with an issue that has been a festering sore for many families in rural and urban Ireland for a long time. It was very worthwhile to reduce capital acquisitions tax to 20% on most lands. However, the Minister missed an opportunity which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government might have a chance to revisit when dealing with the planning Bill. I refer to the massive housing crisis we are currently experiencing, particularly in relation to social housing. One way the Minister for Finance could have dealt with this issue was to propose a motion allowing capital acquisitions tax at 0% on any land sold to local authorities for housing. Such a move would give landowners an incentive to sell lands to local authorities. It would also give local authorities an opportunity to buy land at more competitive prices. Most individuals wait for a private developer to come along because they feel that private developers have more money to spend than local authorities for serviced land or land for housing. On Committee Stage, the Minister should look at possibilities which would help to provide much-needed land for building local authority and social housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, always spoke of the type of economics in which I believed when he was in Opposition. I believe in <Col N="166" /> social justice, but we have to be very careful about how we spend our money.</P>

      <P>The Minister misread the situation. He made a mistake in regard to low pay and in regard to stay-at-home housewives. Individualisation was probably a good idea, if properly thought out. I find it very difficult to believe the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste agreed on this and a week later, when the Minister for Finance read the budget in the Dáil, the Taoiseach organised 20 or 30 backbenchers to go out on the plinth and state that it was not the type of budget he believed in. That is cynicism and one of the reasons we in politics suffer.</P>

      <P>I am not being cynical. I have been around long enough not to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that the Minister espoused economic restraint. Then he found he had a problem and the Government threw money at it to try to fix it. More than £1 billion has been given away in tax cuts this year. However, I guarantee that less money will be given away next year because of mismanagement of the economy. We now have the highest inflation in Europe. We are expanding the economy when we should be cutting back. We cannot control our interest rates because we do not have a Central Bank and interest rates are controlled in Europe. If we did have a Central Bank, interest rates would have been increased. The only thing we can control is the amount we give out in tax cuts. The Minister has given out more money for tax cuts because he did not think through the individualisation measure. Now we are experiencing the largest inflation rate within the EU and that will work against us. Last weekend the Minister stated that this would be only a temporary little arrangement, but anybody who looks into the economy would say that inflation is going to increase rather than decrease in the short-term and that will cause difficulties for our economy. The Minister made a mistake. What he did was ill-judged and not well thought out. Throwing money at a problem will not solve it. We all remember the 1980s when many people emigrated from this country and out of every pound taken in tax 99p went to pay the interest on what we owed. It is particularly important even in good times to make sure to pay off our national debt and reduce it to realistic proportions. Anybody who has studied economic history as I have had the privilege of doing on a number of occasions, knows that whenever there is a boom in the economy it is always followed by a downturn. I hope the downturn in the economy <Col N="167" /> will not be as extreme as that experienced in Europe and elsewhere. I do not think it will be.</P>
    <P>There was an opportunity for the Department of Health and Children to deal with some issues. Back in the 1980s when things were very difficult we called for an embargo in the Civil Service. In Government, Fianna Fáil introduced such an embargo, as did Fine Gael. At the time, that was probably the right way to go. Currently, the private sector is employing as many if not more than the public sector &ndash; something that has not happened before in the history of the State. Ten years ago for every ten people employed, seven worked in the Civil Service. That ratio has now changed to at least 5:5 or perhaps 6:4 in favour of the private sector. The Government should examine the possibility of reducing the number of people employed in the public service which accounts for one third of total Exchequer funding. We cannot allow that to continue. There is an opportunity to do something radical and worthwhile if the Government had the guts to do it. However, neither the budget nor the Finance Bill show that it has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly have a tiger economy and there is no doubt but that it is doing well. However, listening to the Taoiseach and his Ministers in the Fianna Fáil led Administration one would imagine that the tiger was a cub when they came into power. In fact, it was a fully fledged animal and the economy was up and running when Deputy John Bruton led a Government that did marvellous work. The rainbow coalition laid the foundation for this economic boom and the Government has been left in charge of managing it but it is doing a very bad job. There never was as much turmoil in the country. Gardaí were out with the blue 'flu and the nurses, God help them, had to go out on strike also, which was unheard of in this country. The doctors were out on strike, the farmers had to mount a picket to get their rights at the meat factories and there is general annoyance within the unions at present because the low paid are not being looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the present budget was announced by the Minister for Finance, he said in an interview that it would be the mother of all budgets. A dictator in the Middle East used to talk about the mother of all battles but this budget turned out to be a damp squib. The Minister has not looked after the elderly people who built the country for us. Those over 65 came through hard times that we did not see. They laid the real foundations while their families had to emigrate to England and America because there was nothing for them. As a young lad I witnessed céilís in the local hall where presentations of a wallet of notes were made to help unfortunate people to get to America or to England. That time has passed, however, and while it is no reflection on those who left, the people who stayed here are not being looked after. Their small savings are in the credit unions but the Minister would not meet the credit unions <Col N="168" /> who are doing voluntary work. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is well paid for doing his job and he owes it to those who do voluntary work and encourage people to make savings, to meet with them but he would not do it. He will tax every penny of their savings. They are poor people who gathered money so that at the end of their days they would have some little comfort to fall back on. It is unacceptable and people do not like it.</P>
    <P>The Minister meets the banks, however, because they are the big players. They are the people he likes to meet, going down to Jurys where they were hiding in corners handing out brown envelopes stuffed with £50,000. That was some envelope. The ordinary people are not being looked after and it is both wrong and sad.</P>
    <P>I heard one Deputy praising the private sector and the health boards for building nursing homes for the elderly, but do they ever talk to elderly people? How would the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, like to end his days? The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív is, however, one of the Ministers I admire. He stands up for what is right in the House and in the country, and I appreciate that. It is not going unnoticed. He probably has a good future in his party and he deserves it.</P>
    <P>What do any of us want in old age? We want our own home where we are lord and master with some little provisions and comfort, but that will not happen. The Government is getting the private sector to build nursing homes. The elderly will be placed there in groups and sedated because they are easier to manage, but it is wrong to do that. Let us be fair to the old people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not interrupt the Deputy. Nursing homes are springing up like mushrooms all over the country because making money out of old people is a business. Nursing homes have a role to play as respite centres so that families can get a break, but most old people can be cared for in their own homes where they are close to their friends and neighbours. There is goodwill in rural areas but it is not being supported by the State.</P>
      <P>We all know how the banks carried on and we all know what went on in this House with a former Taoiseach and Ministers. I admire the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, for standing up and condemning that activity as 99% of people do. I have been 13 years in the House as an honest, decent and hard-working Deputy, yet we are all being tarred with the one brush. It is wrong to do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit. This all concerns the Finance Bill and making provision for people. We <Col N="169" /> cannot make provision for them, however, if there are rip-offs and if taxes are not being collected. The Finance Bill has everything to do with collecting taxes that are due from everybody, not just the hard-pressed PAYE sector, and giving relief to other sections that need it. It is important to say that and to put down a marker about it.</P>
      <P>I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be interested in the Border region and will say that I am back on track when I mention it. The region is undeveloped and has suffered over the last 30 years, yet some Ministers do not recognise that. The region needs catch-up money and I make no apologies for saying so. We are trying to develop a tourism industry and I hope people North and South will interact. We must encourage that.</P>
      <P>Bed and breakfast services would be a marvellous way of sustaining small farms but the Government is going to put a levy on bed and breakfast operations. That is a small growing sector that at best is only seasonal. People should be encouraged to do such things for themselves. Where are we going and what is the Government's thinking on this matter? I am totally opposed to that proposal and I will oppose it when we debate the Valuation Bill.</P>
      <P>As regards industrial development, not one job has been created in County Cavan in the past 15 years. An IDA Ireland factory has been lying idle for the past two years awaiting a tenant. All sorts of promises in this case were made by the Tánaiste who is a partner in the Government, and she cannot escape blame. I have a pile of letters containing flowery replies, but nothing definite and nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>I regret that my time is running out because there was so much more that I wanted to say. The agricultural economy is depressed and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should understand that. The Minster of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, comes from a rural constituency but does the Minister, Deputy Walsh, understand the needs of small farmers? The farm supplement is not getting down to those who need it. We are talking about a small amount of money to give people some dignity and respect in their locality so they will not have to go hand in mouth to the social welfare officer seeking what they are entitled to. There is much more that I would like to say but there will be other opportunities to say it.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an Chomhaontas Glas nó an Green Party, cuireann an cáinaisnéis an-díomá orainn. Is beag athrú a rinne an Bille Airgeadais ar sin, faraoir. The disappointment the Green Party feels arises from the growing gap between the richest and the poorest. It also relates to the fact that Exchequer returns, which have risen by 120% over the last five years, are not matched by the wages bill which has gone up by only 49% per cent in the same period. There is a growing gap in that regard as well as between high and low earners. The Combat Poverty Agency still points a critical finger at this Admin<Col N="170" /> istration and previous ones, saying that between a third and a quarter of Irish children are at risk from poverty. The Green Party's analysis of the budget is best found by looking more closely at the word &ldquo;economics&rdquo;, the Latin origin of which means to manage; to manage one's house or in this case the State. The word &ldquo;eco&rdquo; is common to &ldquo;economics&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; and the Green Party was known as the ecology party when it was founded. The word &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; is based on the understanding of the house, State or what one is managing. Without an understanding of the form of ecology, the economics tend to be wide of the real issues when it comes to the long-term welfare of the country and the wider world.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;ecology&rdquo;, if we take it as being part of the wider world of economics, assumes that we will always be respectful not just of each other as humans but of all creation, as that is part of the ecology on which we all depend. It assumes also that we would take for granted that all fossil fuels and minerals on which we are so dependent are, to a greater or lesser extent, finite and that we would act accordingly. It also assumes that the actions we take now will not jeopardise the ability of the next generation and generations to come to live full lives after we have gone.</P>
      <P>However, this Bill falls down on these economic assumptions, if they are truly economic based on the roots which give rise to them. The Bill contains simple reliance on gross national product and gross domestic product as indicators of economic well being. It does not contain any measure of biodiversity, though we are committed to protecting that internationally. In fact, not only do GNP and GDP not take into account areas of quality of life for humans and the wider circle of species on which we depend, but they also reward and regard as positive such tragedies as car accidents, when one must spend money on funerals, hospitals, replacement vehicles and so on. They regard sickness, if it involves hospitalisation, as a benefit to the economy. Nobody here would really believe that, but that is the crudity of the economic measurements on which we are depending when examining this and previous legislation.</P>

      <P>There is no measure in the Government's economic strategy of water or air quality along economic lines. These are matters other countries have taken on board and I seek the same from this Government.</P>
      <P>Regarding fossil fuel dependence, this Bill and the budget had an opportunity to tackle our growing dependence on imported fossil fuels by rebalancing our taxation system but failed to do so. The 75% of our energy which depends on imported fuel is set to rise to 90% by the year 2010 and that growing dependence is not just an environmental and economic dependence but makes us very vulnerable in international affairs. Instead we have increased dependence and we are building a new peat fired station which is described as state of the art, but this fails to recognise the inevitable limit of fossil fuel stocks. Our provisions for future generations ought to be a keen indicator of our sincerity in long-term planning. It has been said that the older generation rightly needs care after a lifetime of service to their country and families and that is correct. However, the next generation, which may not have been born yet, will definitely suffer because of short-sightedness in economic planning. Apart from not rebalancing taxation, the failure to decouple fossil fuel energy demand from economic activity means energy demand continues to grow at approximately 6% per year. The Minister for Finance, in not facing up to this, is displaying a recklessness he could relate to his colleagues at Cheltenham; the actions of a drunken, novice punter would be comparable to the failure to plan for the future.</P>
      <P>Chun crich a chur leis, he knows our Kyoto obligation to reducing our 1990 figures by 2010 and yet in 2010 the primary schoolchildren of today will pick up the Bill for this Government because it has failed to internalise the costs of the type of wasteful economy which it underpins.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, which implements the budget measures. Coupled with the national development plan and the recent agreement on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it represents a huge investment in the country. It is a package that will see the ongoing development move from one positive step to another and will ensure prosperity for the forseeable future. However, will all boats rise on this tide? In spite of how good the budget was, I still have some reservations about how we proceed from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that there are regions which do not share in the economic boom. A <Col N="172" /> number of years ago we attracted traditional industries from abroad which set up here, such as the textile industry. That industry competed well in a competitive international market, but recent developments such as the new minimum wage legislation &ndash; which I support &ndash; places a huge financial burden on these industries. I have one in mind in Kilkenny &ndash; we have seen Fruit of the Loom in Donegal &ndash; called Comer International, which has geared itself towards a competitive marketplace, invested heavily in upskilling its labour force, changed its machinery and ensured it is at the cutting edge of developments in the textile industry. This has meant a huge investment and new legislation means further investment is required. However, there is little scope for increasing profit margins in the textile and service industries and the Government will have to look at various measures to complement what companies like Comer International are doing. For example, employers' PRSI contributions could be cut, which would give them an edge they can work with. They will not find the scope in the marketplace to ensure continuity of their position. We should look after these companies which served us well in the days before more mobile and modern employment. If that requires special measures, those measures should be taken.</P>
    <P>I have heard a number of Members complaining about the activities of IDA Ireland in their counties and constituencies. We must spend tax revenue with the same diligence with which it was earned by those who paid it. IDA Ireland has invested in various properties, sometimes in advance factories. The south-east region, the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency specifically, has suffered considerably from the lack of multinational investors. The region has not enjoyed the employment boom which has been experienced in places like Waterford, Limerick and Galway. We should look at the multinational companies which have located in these urban centres and see whether they would be prepared to extend their operations into the regions. We must ascertain whether they can be accommodated in the advance factories which lie idle in various counties and we must focus particularly on regions which have not enjoyed the full scale employment experienced in other counties.</P>
    <P>We, in Kilkenny, were encouraged by IDA Ireland to build an advance factory and we did that through local involvement in a BES scheme. IDA Ireland provided an office block. The buildings are state of the art facilities yet they lie idle more than nine months after their completion. These buildings represent an investment in the region of £6 million. That money will not be well spent until such time as IDA Ireland successfully attracts multinational companies to fill the buildings and to offer Carlow and Kilkenny a well deserved opportunity. IDA Ireland should be asked to focus on these areas and to consult with multinational companies which may wish to expand.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland also owns Purcell's Inch which has <Col N="173" /> not been fully developed and comprises second generation estates. That land should now be made available to indigenous industry whose needs would be compatible with the facilities on the estate. I urge the Minister to ensure that the IDA Ireland can raise extra revenue by selling those sites to interested companies which cannot find land because of the land shortage or which, perhaps, cannot afford the asking price for land which is zoned industrial. Industrialists and entrepreneurs are entitled to play their part at county level in the development of information technology. There is no reason why e-commerce and IT infrastructure cannot be extended to the counties to enable multinationals which are already located here to locate anywhere in the country while remaining at the cutting edge of developments in their own industries. The locations in which such infrastructure is already available should be the first to benefit.</P>
    <P>County towns are dying on their feet for the want of industry. IDA Ireland should speak to people who understand the Japanese market, for example, and who could encourage Japanese factories, which are currently looking at Ireland and which are not interested in IDA Ireland support or for which IDA Ireland support is not a prerequisite, to locate here. Such people could be paid on an agency basis to encourage Japanese companies and others to locate in county towns. I am happy to say that Kilkenny and Thomastown were successful in this regard and that success should be built upon to encourage more companies to locate in this country and create jobs.</P>
    <P>The first question industrialists ask is about roads infrastructure. It was announced this evening that the N9, which will form the central corridor between Waterford and Dublin, is to run through Carlow and Kilkenny. That is a positive development for which we have waited a long time. Industrialists will also ask about the education infrastructure. I encourage the Minister to consider the real possibilities which exist in regard to out-reach education. The Waterford and Carlow Institutes of Technology are both located close to Kilkenny. There is an interest in Kilkenny from the NUI, Maynooth, and Queen's University. I do not see why the State, which has invested in the development of these institutes of technology and in the NUI, Maynooth, cannot develop out-reach centres where it is viable to do so. I appreciate that it would impose a further burden on financial resources but it would complement the investment which has already been made in these institutions and it would make them more meaningful in local terms.</P>
    <P>We have proven in Kilkenny that a locally funded out-reach centre working in conjunction with NUI, Maynooth, and St. Kieran's College and with interests from Armagh, Carlow, Waterford and Cork can be successful. Such a model would form a successful industrial base because industrialists always consider the location of the nearest educational institutions. The location of an out-reach centre in Kilkenny would com<Col N="174" /> plement what is happening industrially in the county. If we do not receive funding for that in the near future, our efforts over the past four years will come to nothing.</P>
    <P>Industrialists also inquire about health services. I regret to say that the developments which have occurred in the health area have not exactly benefited the south-east region. Everything is diverted to Waterford. Investment is currently being made in service provision at a site at St. Luke's in Kilkenny. Investment has already been made in Kilcreane Hospital and a proactive role should be adopted by the Department, in conjunction with the South Eastern Health Board, to ensure that the services which existed at the Kilcreane Hospital would at least be reinstated and that the necessary funding would be provided to develop them. A community as large as that in Kilkenny should at least have a Government funded home for the elderly. That is an issue which has been on the political agenda in my constituency for the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>If we are to play our part in the economy, these issues must be addressed. If they are not addressed, we will continue to lag behind and will not be able to play our rightful role in a developing and successful economy. Investment must be tied into a regional plan in conjunction with the health boards and local authorities. A focus and emphasis on industrial development is necessary. This will complement local investment. The self-help ethos has been the cornerstone of our development. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The new millennium has brought great times. Our people have a new confidence and a good standard of living of which we only dreamt a short time ago. Matters have improved recently. This Government can justifiably claim credit for our economic buoyancy. I congratulate the Minister on the budget which has laid the foundation for the continued prosperity our people rightfully enjoy. I accept the budget has not satisfied everybody. It is fair to say many of our workers have been burdened with a crippling level of income tax for far too long. The Minister was right to introduce measures to substantially reduce these penal levels of taxation.</P>
      <P>This budget delivered the largest tax package in the history of the State, with substantial direct tax reductions for everyone. I welcome the tax reductions of more than £1 billion in this budget, in addition to the £1 billion in tax cuts in the Government's first two budgets. This budget also removed 70,000 people from the tax net, including 10,000 people over 65 years. It is a comprehensive plan to enable everyone to enjoy a higher standard of living and a better quality of life. These are the result of better employment opportunities, a decline in emigration, a reduction in our foreign debts and the promotion of our national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been great economic growth in the past four or five years, particularly since the <Col N="175" /> present Minister for Finance entered office. Countries around the world are wondering how we have achieved it. I am convinced the policies implemented by this Government are behind it. The Minister for Finance spoke at the launch of the development plan in Sligo some weeks ago. He referred to how the policies implemented by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey and the former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, led to current economic growth.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that this Government successfully negotiated the retention of Objective One status for Border, midland and western counties. Nobody can deny this was a great victory for this country, the Taoiseach and his Cabinet. It was one of the greatest achievements for this country. I am delighted to represent an Objective One region. There were objections in this House and from the EU about our being awarded Objective One status. However, I am delighted we achieved it.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement, the Minister expressed concern about the problems which have arisen from our economic success including the costs facing families where both parents work, urban sprawl and the rising cost of housing. I welcome this Government's provision of more than 40,000 houses and its commitment to increase this number. It is a sign of the times that my local authority and others throughout the country cannot get enough builders to build houses. As a carpenter, I had to emigrate from this country many years ago. A large number of people are coming back from England, America and all over the world to work here. If one listens to the accents, one realises the number of English people working here. We cannot find enough people to build our houses. I am delighted there is so much employment.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy, I acknowledge the part played by the Minister in implementing the rural renewal scheme. Many people were not satisfied with it &ndash; my parish was divided in two and I do not live in a rural renewal area, as I live a long distance from the Shannon catchment area. I welcome the introduction of the scheme in parts of County Sligo, particularly Ballymoate and Tubbercurry. The benefits of this scheme are evident. I am delighted that every town and village in the designated areas have been transformed. Many houses have been built and more are at the planning stage. Businesses are thriving and the tax incentives are encouraging new ventures, which are being started daily. The 10% tax incentive is also motivating people to refurbish old dwellings. This is the greatest scheme to be introduced in rural areas. I hope that when it is completed in two or three years, the Minister will introduce it in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of a one-stop-shop in Tubbercurry by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government which will include a library, motor taxation and Revenue offices, the health board, FÁS and provide information on planning, social welfare and Leader schemes. This is mini-decentralisation which is great for the town. I ask the Minister to continue the good <Col N="176" /> work. When the tax incentives expire in three years I hope he will provide rural renewal for the villages of Cloonacool, Aclare and Curry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to those who contributed to the debate yesterday and today. The main Opposition spokespersons concentrated principally on the macro issues surrounding the budget and the Finance Bill, and that is as it should be. Deputy McDowell referred to the PRSI and health levy changes. I appreciate the points he is seeking to make but these changes are relevant to the Social Welfare Bill and are not in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The main point which Deputy Noonan made is that the budget lacked direction and gave a confused economic signal. I reject that. The budget is consistent with the tax reform proposals put before the electorate by the Government parties. If keeping one's promises is inconsistent or eccentric, I am happy to be so labelled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be one of the happiest Deputies in Leinster House in years to come when all my promises in this regard are fulfilled. When he succeeds me as Minister for Finance, he will be happy to have all the work done for him beforehand.</P>
      <P>The main feature of the budget tax strategy has also been endorsed by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. That programme sets out the direction for tax policy endorsed by the social partners. It also recognises that tax reductions can be delivered in more than one way &ndash; through increased allowances, widening bands or reducing rates. If the Opposition is confused by the budget, the voters are not as recent opinion polls indicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much emphasis was laid on the rise in inflation and various ominous warnings were made about competitiveness and the future of the national consensus on pay. I was accused of playing down this issue. It is disappointing that there is so much misunderstanding about how inflation is determined in an economy like Ireland. As the House is aware, the Irish economy is small and open. Historically, external factors such as international inflation and exchange developments largely determined our rate of inflation. It is no different today. Inflation has increased recently due to the weakness of the euro and the increase in oil prices. The euro has fallen by approximately 15% against the dollar and 12% against sterling since the beginning of 1999. It is true that this factor is pushing up prices in the rest of Europe. But the weakness of the euro is having a greater effect here because we trade more with countries outside the euro. In addition, crude oil prices have <Col N="177" /> risen by approximately 150% in dollar terms since March 1999. The rise is closer to 180% in Irish pound terms when the decline in the euro is factored in. This has led to a dramatic effect on energy prices, adding over 1% to the rate of inflation. The budget day increase in excise duty has also added to inflation by about 0.75%. I am sure that all Deputies in this House agree this is a sensible and important health promotion measure. Long after Irish inflation has fallen back to more moderate levels, we will see the benefits of this in terms of reduced smoking related illness.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested that budgetary policy is irresponsible and adding to inflation. This is clearly not the case given that inflation is mainly determined externally. In addition, the Government is running the largest budget surplus in the history of the State and one of the largest in the European Union. If some believe that policy should be tighter to reduce inflation, they should call for lower expenditure and/or a higher tax burden and say clearly which areas would suffer. I am confident that as the impact of the negative external factors are reduced, inflation will begin to fall in the second half of this year.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy McDowell in his contribution shared my analysis of the situation, even if he did not go all the way with my position. I also note that he shares my scepticism over the economic advice we receive from some international commentators. He suggested a lack of concern on my part for the low paid. Deputy Deenihan also addressed this issue. The facts are that in my first three budgets I acted to exclude over 175,000 low paid from the tax net. In the previous three budgets the corresponding figure was 38,000. They say action speaks louder than words and this is certainly the case on this issue. Deputy Rabbitte called the budget anti-working class and anti-poor but perhaps he was not aware of the facts just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan suggested that I could have balanced the impact of the tobacco excise increase by reductions in excise on petrol and fossil fuels. This option is not open to me if we are to meet environmental commitments to reduce unacceptable levels of emissions to the atmosphere. I looked at possible changes to VAT but my priorities are to reduce direct tax to reward effort and increase the supply of productive resources rather than to subsidise consumption. I welcome, however, the Deputy's support for the tobacco measure on health policy grounds. There is no discord between us on that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also criticised the individualisation proposals and the £3,000 home carer's allowance as contradictory. I do not go along with this critique. The increase in the standard rate band incentivises those two income families over £28,000 per annum and is a direct consequence of the substantial increase in the standard rate band for single earners. The £3,000 allowance on the other hand is available to all single income families, whether above or below £28,000 per annum, who meet the conditions. The income disregard <Col N="178" /> and the tapered withdrawal of the relief are intended to minimise the labour market effects.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness as moderating the individualisation policy because of the references in it to keeping the band under review in light of wage rises. Deputy Rabbitte also made much of this misconception in his contribution. The relevant passage in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The social partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual tax payers. They also agree that the standard rate income tax band should be kept under review in the light of increases in income levels and the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>This is the full and correct position and is not as portrayed by the Deputies. My proposals set out to achieve and exceed the 80% target and this remains the goal, as the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, made clear. The policy initiative in the budget in this area was not a solo run, as Deputy McDowell sought to portray it, but a Government policy which will be enacted through this Finance Bill. Perhaps English is dealt with in a different format in Limerick from other parts of the country. I heard Deputy Noonan yesterday in the Dáil and when the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was published putting this construction on the section in that programme. I am outlining the position. I do not know whether Deputy Rabbitte read the programme. Perhaps he took his interpretation from what Deputy Noonan said which was that the widening of the bands to £17,000 will apply as per wage increases. The measure in this paragraph means a widening of the £28,000 band as incomes increase. If the Deputy does not wish to take my word on the matter, I invite him to ring either ICTU or IBEC who will agree with my construction. This is what the paragraph means. However, Deputy Noonan and others will have to wait for my next two budgets to see how matters progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to changing of expenditure targets by the Government. I wish to emphasise at the outset that controlling expenditure within prudent limits is a key element in the Government's budgetary and economic strategy. The Deputy will be aware that the recently agreed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will inevitably impact on public expenditure levels. The programme will contribute to maintaining the competitiveness of the economy and provide a strong base for further economic prosperity while improving the quality of life and living standards for all. In this context I am convinced that the expenditure undertakings included in the agreement represent an appropriate balance between the requirements of budgetary prudence and the benefits accruing to the <Col N="179" /> economy as a whole from a new partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputies Deenihan and Noonan raised the credit union issue and the question of the EU complaint alleging an unfair bias in favour of the credit union sector. As I made clear, I sought to react positively to the credit unions' concerns in 1998 but my efforts were rebuffed. I drew attention in recent remarks to the EU aspect of credit union taxation and was accused of introducing a non-issue to obscure the debate. This is not the case. The EU complaint is live and very relevant. Any further moves to favour credit unions would require EU approval for which there could be a price in terms of the credit unions' corporate tax exemption. We ignore the EU state aids rules at some peril. I know this is so, but the credit unions do not appear to have grasped that fact.</P>
    <P>We should also be clear that there are tax equity issues involved in what the credit unions want. I must look to the interests of all taxpayers and their entitlement to be treated fairly. This is a wider concern than the insistent demands made by one sector. There are also tax evasion issues. I do not consider it wise to provide tax free, non-reportable accounts in the light of all we have seen with regard to DIRT and financial institutions in the past year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised two issues. One related to profit sharing and gain sharing and his disappointment at the absence of new initiatives in the Bill. I am also anxious to make progress on this item to the benefit of both sides of industry and to assist the newer and dynamic sector of the economy. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness envisages the setting up of a working group consisting of representatives of ICTU, IBEC and the Departments concerned to prepare proposals in this area at an early date. This group has already commenced its work and it met for the first time last week on 16 February.</P>
    <P>The second issue related to film relief. I accept Deputy Deenihan's credentials on this matter and I am prepared to discuss the issue of the appropriate level of tax relief on Committee Stage. The current relief is generous and I do not accept, when the top rate of tax is cut, that we have to increase the level of relief to compensate for the cut. As I said in my opening remarks, the EU Commission has taken the view that tax deductions which overcompensate for money actually laid out may be operating aids to business, something which we now have to avoid.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell defined the low paid as all those below the average industrial wage which stands at approximately £17,000 per annum. This is a wide definition of low pay. However, using that measure, the budget did much for the group earning between £14,000 and £17,000 by increasing the one earner standard band. I have also done much for single persons earning over £14,000 in my budgets by cutting the higher rate of tax by 4%. Perhaps the Deputy and I are closer on policy on the reform of the tax system than <Col N="180" /> either of us thinks, but I cannot persuade myself of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept his analysis that my budget prejudices social partnership. We have successfully negotiated a successor to Partnership 2000 which is being put through the balloting process at present. The new programme sets out agreed texts on tax policy. On the individualisation issue, the trade union reaction at the time of the budget, and since then, has been uniformly positive.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates made the case for a new intermediate income tax rate of 35% instead of cutting the top rate of income tax. However, such a new rate would be an effective cut in the current top rate of 11 percentage points for those taxpayers concerned. Perhaps he thinks I should go further in cutting the top rate of tax. He also mentioned the issue of low-sulphur diesel and representations by private coach operators. This can be taken up on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry criticised me for favouring the rich and he said that the budget started tax reform at the top instead of at the bottom of the income scale. Interestingly, his party's tax proposals, if implemented, would have given a single person on £50,000 per annum nearly twice the tax cut in percentage terms as a single person on £10,000 per annum. This is a strange way to achieve a bottom-up approach.</P>
      <P>Deputies on both sides welcomed the CAT changes on the family home and I was happy to deliver on that matter. On the wider issue of the change in CAT rules, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, ably argued the case that these changes would improve the effectiveness of the CAT code in applying the tax even with the reduction in the CAT rates.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies complained that there was an absence of fair and practicable proposals on child care in the budget. I draw their attention to the commitment of £250 million to the child care problem in the national development plan. The first instalment of this money was committed in the budget which contains an allocation of £46 million. This money will be principally directed at increasing the supply of child care places, particularly in disadvantaged areas. In addition, I have introduced enhanced tax concessions in the Finance Bill to encourage employers to become involved in solving this problem.</P>
      <P>I draw the House's attention to paragraph 4.3.11 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which commits us to adopting, before the end of 2000, an equitable strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs for implementation in the period of the programme. We intend to address proposals such as those put forward in the partnership negotiations, which included proposals for direct payments for each child. Thus, there is a procedure in place to carry the matter forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> Many Deputies raised a wide variety of points which I cannot cover in the time available. A few concerned demands for more expenditure in various areas. Others were supportive of the further measures taken in the Bill to tackle tax evasion. I thank them all for their comments and I have taken note of them.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill will make a significant impact in improving and adding to the real wealth <Col N="182" /> of our community. I urge the House to give the Bill its Second Reading as proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That, in respect of the Finance Bill, 2000, the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the main Question and, in respect of the Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance for 1997 and 1998, Motions 9 and 5, respectively, are hereby agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>Dromcollogher is situated in the foothills of the Mullahareirk Mountains near the Cork border. There are two streams which flow through the village, one from Carraward townland and the other the Ahavarragh stream. It has experienced severe flooding over a prolonged period which has caused distress for many householders in the village. The problem is compounded by a raw sewage overflow because of an inadequate sewerage system.</P>
      <P>Following a succession of flooding incidents Limerick County Council appointed consultants to report on the overall problem. They produced their report in December 1997 which was forwarded to the Office of Public Works for its consideration.</P>
      <P>The report outlined the sequence of flooding from 1984 to August 1997, when there was the most serious flooding incident. As a result of the flooding, Limerick County Council appointed consultants. They outlined 27 occasions over the 13 years on which flooding occurred. While on many occasions the roads were flooded, on some occasions each summer, especially over the three year period 1995 to 1997, not only the roads but also the houses were flooded and on one occasion the local church was flooded.</P>
      <P>The ongoing flooding has caused severe hardship and inconvenience for the people of Drumcollogher, especially the residents of Pike Street and Pound Street. It is time to put an end to this intolerable situation which not only caused concern to Limerick County Council but also to the Mid-Western Health Board because of the raw sewage overflow. Downstream from the village, bridges and culverts have backed up and flooded adjoining lands.</P>
      <P>The consultants made their recommendations over two years ago. They especially pinpointed the lack of capacity in the river below Drumcollogher which contributed to the flooding problems in the village. The consultants further concluded that work should be carried out by the Office of Public Works at the earliest possible time.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter at local council level and the council indicated it is hopeful that the works will be carried out this year and that finance will be provided. I raise this matter on the Adjournment to indicate how essential these works are. It is totally unjust that the community in Drumcollogher must tolerate on an ongoing basis the hardship, financial loss and inconvenience. Having highlighted the case to provide funding, it is imperative that the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, can confirm that funding will be provided and that the works will be completed this year. I look forward to his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be here this evening to inform the House of the progress made to date to help alleviate the flooding problem in the village of Drumcollogher. The village is located in south County Limerick and, as the Deputy stated, has a history of flooding over many years. The most serious recent flooding took place on the night of 26 August 1997 and the morning of 27 August 1997. Flooding on this occasion was very severe with several homes in the Pike Street area flooded to a depth of 0.5 metres.</P>
      <P>Limerick County Council commissioned a report on the flooding and received an interim report on the Drumcollogher flood problems in December 1997. It then requested that the Office of Public Works should carry out flood relief works in the area. Following further discussions with Limerick County Council, the Office of Public Works undertook a survey to establish the cause of the flooding in the Drumcollogher area in February 1999. On the basis of this survey, consultants were commissioned in May 1999 to carry out a feasibility study on the flood relief works necessary in the village in order to provide acceptable flood protection. The studies were completed in September 1999 and in early October my officials commenced discussions with Limerick County Council as to how best to bring the matter forward.</P>
      <P>Limerick County Council agreed that it could carry out the work if given the funding. As I stated previously and repeat, this funding is available in the current year's Estimate for the Office of Public Works. There are, however, legal matters to be settled before work can commence but once these technicalities are finalised, the works can be commenced.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Finucane for raising the issue. In fairness, all the Deputies and Senators in the area, as the Deputy will be aware, have been in constant contact with me and my office on the issue. I hope that in the interests of the people of Drumcollogher, I can have this issue resolved as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for choosing this issue. The decision by the Western Health Board to refuse the application for a licence to operate a community pharmacy in Knock came as a shock to the community. One will recall that when the Pope visited Ireland in 1979 he clearly told the world audience from the specially erected altar outside the basilica at Knock, &ldquo;I am now at the goal of my journey&rdquo;. Small wonder then that the people of Knock are still in disbelief that an international pilgrimage centre, which has played no small part in helping to put Ireland on the world map, should be denied such a basic service as access to an over the counter pharmacy service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How the chief executive officer of the Western <Col N="187" /> Health Board, in the light of the huge annual pilgrim and tourist influx to Knock, should unilaterally decide on 5 January last to refuse the application for a community pharmacy is simply incredible. Every year 1.5 million tourists and pilgrims visit Knock. One can imagine the incredulity when they inquire about a chemist only to be told by embarrassed local shopkeepers, &ldquo;Sorry, we do not have pharmacy here. You must travel seven miles to Ballyhaunis, six miles to Kiltimagh, seven miles to Kilkelly or seven miles to Claremorris to buy medicines and have prescriptions filled&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It must be realised that a large percentage of the visitors and pilgrims travel to Knock by bus. Therefore, they cannot travel to the surrounding towns if they need a pharmacist unless they hire a taxi or a hackney. It must also be appreciated that, because of the age profile of many of these people and because a certain percentage of them are suffering illnesses, they are obviously in the category which is likely to require medicines and they come to Knock on the understandable presumption that there must be pharmacy services available.</P>
    <P>Even if Knock never was a place of international pilgrimage, its recent growth and current population make a compelling case for the licensing of a pharmacy. The returns from the 1996 census speak for themselves. A breakdown of the different district electoral divisions indicates that Knock north had a population of 645, of whom 135 were over 65; Knock south had 741, of whom 224 were over 65; Ballyhowley had 442, of whom 76 were over 65 and Bekan, a substantial portion of which comes within the Knock catchment, had a population of 748, of which 154 were over 65. In total, there are 2,589 permanent residents, of whom 589 or 23% were over 65.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that in the intervening four years there has been a substantial increase in house building activity and a commensurate increase in the population of Knock. The recent petition, hastily put together but avidly signed by the Knock community, reinforces the need and demand. Modern Knock clearly meets the criterion.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister might be advised that there are two dispensing doctors who service the Knock area and that this is being used as an excuse for denying Knock a pharmacy licence. Let us be clear, such an arrangement is totally inadequate. These doctors cannot be available 24 hours a day and at weekends, which is a time of greatest influx of pilgrims.</P>
    <P>Knock is entitled to a fully fledged pharmacy service of its own. It meets the criteria in terms of its resident population. Its entitlement is enhanced and beyond yea or nay by the massive annual pilgrim influx. If there is to be any doubt about its viability, the fact that three pharmacists have applied and tendered to locate in Knock answers comprehensively that question.</P>
    <P>Only the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, or <Col N="188" /> the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, can overturn the decision by the chief executive officer, and I ask him to do so. I ask him not to do so on the basis of a favour, making an exception or bending rules but on the merits of the case and the proven need. I ask him to do so now before the new pilgrim season begins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position. There is no licensing system for community pharmacies. Any person or company may open and operate a pharmacy in compliance with the provisions of the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 to 1977. The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board may grant a community pharmacy contractor agreement for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is threefold: first, to bring about a more even geographic distribution of community pharmacies based on public health need; second, to enable the provision of the quality service required by the new contract also introduced in 1996; and, third, to bring the situation in Ireland broadly into line with that elsewhere in the European Union where similar controls exist. Prior to the introduction of the regulations in 1996, Ireland was the only member state without such controls.</P>
      <P>The regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of the relevant health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements. They provide for the examination of an application and the making of recommendations by an assessment board established by the chief executive officer.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy mentioned, the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board refused the applications for a community pharmacy contractor arrangement in Knock on the basis that a definitive public health need, as defined in the regulations, had not been established. That decision is the subject of two separate appeals submitted in late January, as provided for in article 10 of the regulations.</P>
      <P>To enable consideration of the appeal, my Department requested full documentation on the decision from the chief executive officer and when this is received, the Minister, Deputy Martin, will give the matter urgent consideration. In these circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because a number of people who provide a service, the registration of births, deaths and marriages, feel very <Col N="189" /> aggrieved that this Government has done nothing about their salary scale. They get £170 per year which goes towards their office costs, including maintenance, heat, insurance, light and expenses such as postage. We talk about the Celtic tiger but they are not even getting the Celtic tail, which is wrong.</P>
      <P>They get 68p for every item they register. It can be difficult for them to collect when they register a death because people may be very upset and distressed. In September 1997, the Government circulated a letter to all registrars telling them that a new fee structure was awaiting approval in the Department. Three years later, it still awaits that approval. They have that letter, which said it would be sanctioned by the Department, as proof.</P>
      <P>The last increase was 13 years ago in 1987. Since then, the volume of work has become more complex with all the new legislation, including the Still Birth Registration Act, 1994, and the notification of intention to marry under the Family Law Act. This is all new work for them. It is fine for those who have a second job but many registrars do not have other jobs.</P>
      <P>People in the community can identify the registrar. We want this service to remain in rural Ireland; we do not want another service to be taken away. I do not want the Minister or the Government to centralise this process in a large town, such as Castlebar or Ballina.</P>
      <P>We ask for a just reward for doing a good job and that these people are paid a reasonable wage. It is 13 years since there was an increase and £170 for a year's work is not adequate. I ask the Minister of State, who has responsibility for this matter, to back date by at least three years whatever increase was agreed in that report. That should be done immediately so that these people are given a just and honest wage. They do a great job in the community and people know who they are. They fill in forms, assist people and provide offices in their houses and it is wrong that they do not get a just reward for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The administration of the registration system for births, deaths and marriages is primarily a matter for An t-Árd Chláraitheoir, the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>Persons appointed registrars, who are not permanent and pensionable employees of the health boards, derive their income from fees or registrations and fees for the certification issued by them. These fees are set out in statutory instruments, including SI 278 of 1987, which sets out the principal fees for the registration of events and the issue of certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular and limited circumstances, a registrar may issue a certificate which is compiled from an entry in a register in which amendments have been made and the fees for such certificates are set out in SI 234 of 1987. The fees are cur<Col N="190" /> rently being reviewed and I hope this review will satisfy all concerned. I note the delay which Deputy Ring mentioned and will again bring it to the notice of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report which appeared in the<i> Irish Independent </i>this morning stating that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, will bring proposals to Government next month seeking to privatise the RTE transmission network is a matter of major concern. The reasons for this concern are not only in regard to digital terrestrial television broadcasting but in regard to the potential other uses to which this country-wide system of strategically placed equipment could be put.</P>
      <P>If the agenda is to remove this important infrastructural asset from public to private ownership, and if that disposal is based on an estimated valuation of £30 million to £40 million, then the Minister must be prevented from doing that. I demand that the Minister clarify if the alleged valuation is based on the broadcasting value only or if it is based on the telephony or technology conversion potential as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister in her speech at the commencement of the Second Stage debate on the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, stated that the Bill enabled her to designate a company, which will be licensed by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, to construct and operate the digital terrestrial television infrastructure. She further stated that RTE will be a minor partner with a shareholding of up to 40% and that the company will be mandated to build and operate the digital terrestrial television structure and to promote the development of multimedia services and the information society. It would appear all this has gone out the window.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a responsibility to say what has brought about this fundamental change in direction in regard to the designated company's composition. Keeping the RTE transmission network in public ownership whereby leases can be negotiated which would be commercially attractive but where the State would get the optimum value, should be the policy priority for the Minister. This morning's newspaper report indicates that the Minister is going in the opposite direction. The House deserves a full and frank explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Without discussion on Second Stage of the Bill of the proposal in today's newspapers, the Minister has suggested the sale of the transmission system which carries the national broadcasting system. This is frankly outrageous. The Bill is now on Committee Stage. She has suggested, in total defiance and in opposite of what she announced on Second Stage, that she pro<Col N="191" /> poses a complete change of policy on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed is a blow to the concept of national identity and national integrity. It is a capitulation to the very worst tendencies in international market thinking. Given the convergence in technology to which Deputy O'Shea referred, it fuels the concentration of ownership and it is the commodification of communication. To put it simply, the national broadcaster built the transmission system out of the licence fee. It was not built by direct State funding but by the people through the licence fee. That broadcaster will, effectively, become a tenant on sufferance in a system which it built.</P>
      <P>It appears the Minister proposes to instruct RTE, the national broadcaster, to dispose of this asset to, what is called in the newspaper, the highest bidder in the market. Where is the mandate for the sale of an asset bought out of the licence fee paid by the people? In regard to those who advised on the value of the asset, Allied Irish Capital Markets, can the Minister give an assurance that no other part of that company in its extension or in any other form is in any way conflicted by involvement in any potential sport for one of the bids that might emerge should it be sold to the highest bidder? This is a sad evening. The BBC across the water has just got a licence fee increase to prepare it for the digital age. A proposal has been leaked, which the Minister has suggested is substantially true, that this pillar of democracy and diversity and diversity of editorial opinion is now to be huckstered on to the market. It is an absolute disgrace. Committee Stage of the Bill should be stopped immediately. The Minister should come into this Chamber. If she has a proposal for the privatisation of what she does not own, what the people own, she should have the courage to defend it at Second Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá i dtosach báire go bhfuil an tAire as baile agus murach é sin bheadh sí anseo í féin tráthnóna. Ba mhaith liom chomh maith buíochas a ghlacadh leis na Teachtaí as deis a thabhairt dom cuid de na fíricí a bhaineann leis an rud seo a shoiléiriú. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision of 22 July 1998 on the arrangements to be made for the introduction of digital terrestrial television provided that the existing transmission function should be separated from RTE. Under the terms of the decision, the entity thus created, in which RTE would retain an equity stake, would be mandated to build and operate the DTT infrastructure and to promote the development of mult-imedia services and the information society. The decision also provided that the manner of the sale, the selection of the purchaser and the criteria for such selection were to be decided by a group headed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and <Col N="192" /> the Islands, including the Ministers for Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Public Enterprise and RTE. A project management group made up of representatives of the Ministers concerned and RTE was established on foot of the Government decision.</P>
    <P>The Government decision of July 1998 also authorised the Minister to have a Bill drafted which, among other things, would provide a statutory framework for the introduction of DTT and the ongoing regulation of indigenous digital television services across all delivery platforms.</P>
    <P>Since that time the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, has been published and has completed its Second Stage in this House. In parallel with work on the Bill, the project management group has set about the task of separating the transmission network from RTE and selecting the investor in the new digital transmission entity envisaged in the Government's decision. Given the importance and complexity of the task, the project management group selected a consortium of advisers led by AIB to advise on and manage the project to a conclusion under the direction of the group.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of work has been done in identifying the assets to be transferred. The preparation of an information memorandum was put in train. Arrangements were made to ensure that the decisions of the project management group would be informed by the concerns of the staff in RTE who would likely be transferred to the new digital transmission entity. Considerable work in developing the structure and management of the transaction to select the majority partner in the DTT platform was carried out. The transaction structure had to be such that it ensured that RTE and Teilifís na Gaeilge, now TG4, would obtain fair value for the assets to be transferred to the new entity. In addition to this requirement, it is crucial that the transaction framework satisfied legal and regulatory requirements at national and European Union level.</P>
    <P>The development of a transaction process that satisfied all the requirements and the participants on the project management group and met the Government objectives in introducing digital terrestrial television has proved to be a difficult and complex task. The Minister, with the advice of the project management group, has been considering how best to progress the establishment of a DTT platform and has sought the observations of some of her Cabinet colleagues on a possible way forward. If and when the Minister decides that it is necessary to bring proposals to Government to progress the matter further, she will do so. Deputies will be aware that it would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment further on the report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> at this stage.</P>

      <P>I have explained on a number of occasions the arrangements that are in place in my office to deal with the Independent Deputies who support the Government. As I have confirmed before, a staff member in my office assists the Government Chief Whip's office in its work with these Deputies, which includes regular meetings. I also meet them from time to time in my office and arrange to keep them briefed on issues and assist in arranging meetings with Ministers as the need arises.</P>
      <P>In the case of Deputy Foley, I can confirm to the Dáil that in his letter of resignation sent to the Government Chief Whip he undertook to continue to support the Government. No other arrangements are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have not yet had any communications with Mr. Ivico Racan, the new Croatian Prime Minister, who has been in office for just under a month.</P>
      <P>I will meet with Prime Minister Guterres on 28 February as part of his tour of capitals to discuss the content of the Special European Council which is taking place in Lisbon on 23-24 March. The Cabinet committee on EU affairs has already discussed the summit in detail at its last meeting on 8 February. No formal agenda has been made available in advance of the summit but a series of correspondence papers and meetings have taken place between the presidency and partners. Apart from particular input at two special preparatory meetings in Lisbon and Brussels of Prime Ministers' representatives, officials from my Department have held discussions around the general themes of employment, social exclusion and also knowledge and innovation in the Information Society with visiting Portuguese, UK and Swedish delegations. However, in addition to the focus on employment, it is likely that other matters of a current nature will be discussed, and that the Presidency will wish to update partners in relation to the Intergovernmental Conference and CFSP developments, both of which will be discussed in more detail at the June meeting of the European Council. An opportunity to review progress on the Charter of Fundamental Rights will also be available.</P>
      <P>I plan to hold a meeting of the Cabinet committee on EU affairs immediately in advance of my departure for the summit. I expect that this meeting will also consider preparations for the Euro-African Cairo Summit which is scheduled to take place on 3 and 4 April.  It has been agreed that the agenda for the first summit between the Heads of State or Government of the European Union and Africa will include economic and social, political and development issues. Preparatory meetings at official level are ongoing and I continue to follow developments closely. The summit is a historic and constructive step in the development of the EU's future relations with Africa. I believe that it will provide an excellent opportunity to further enhance the close links that already exist between us and develop our partnership for the future in a positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my visit to Lesotho and South Africa, I wrote to the President of the Commission and to members of the European Council in January proposing that the EU and the member states should explore what additional steps might be taken in order to address the challenge of HIV-AIDS in Africa. My letter mentioned that this year the Commission would be assessing the operations, financed under the existing Com<Col N="195" /> munity regulation on HIV-AIDS, in developing countries.</P>
    <P>This assessment should provide a useful opportunity to revitalise the EU's approach to this issue. It will also be necessary to explore the scope for greater collective action by the EU and the member states and to review the level of resources currently committed to the fight against HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>My letter also raised the issue of access by the affected developing countries to generic rather than branded medicines for the treatment of AIDS at reasonable cost. I have also raised the matter with Commissioner Byrne.</P>
    <P>Since January there have been informal official level contacts both with President Prodi's office and with the relevant directorates in the Commission. I understand that the Commission is preparing a comprehensive and detailed response to my initiative which has been positively received. I expect that a formal reply from the Commission will be received this week.</P>
    <P>At the informal meeting of the Development Ministers in Lisbon on 27-28 January, Ireland raised the issue of the fight against AIDS. We again suggested that the Commission and the member states should consider how best the EU could collectively assist the most affected countries. Our intervention was received warmly and the development Ministers singled out the HIV-AIDS issue as one of central importance to the future of development.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that, in preparation for the forthcoming Euro-African Cairo summit, EU member states including Ireland, are identifying the fight against HIV-AIDS as a priority for discussion with our African partners. This summit will provide a useful forum for a further expression of the international solidarity which is essential if the spread of HIV-AIDS is to be checked and those infected are to receive treatment.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks, we will continue to work with the Commission and with the member states with a view to promoting a more concerted and visible approach by the EU in the fight against the spread of HIV-AIDS in developing countries. Given the importance of the issue, I have suggested that, if necessary, it might be discussed at a future meeting of the European Council.</P>

      <P>The Government approved the Border counties element of the draft PEACE programme, the successor to the special programme for peace and reconciliation, at its meeting of 4 February. The draft programme was the culmination of a widespread consultation process in Northern Ireland and the Border counties, including a major conference held in Monaghan on 30 September last. The Government approval covered the five priority objectives agreed with Northern Ireland, indicative funding provision for each of the priorities and the proposed delivery mechanisms <Col N="197" /> through which it is intended that the new programme will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The five priority objectives agreed with Northern Ireland are: economic renewal, social integration inclusion and reconciliation, locally-based regeneration and development strategies, outward and forward looking region and crossBorder co-operation. The programme provides for EU funding to Northern Ireland and the Border counties of 500 million euro over the five year period 2000 to 2004 based on similar proportions, 80:20, as the first peace programme. The pro<Col N="198" /> vision for 15% of funding to be reserved for cross-Border actions will be maintained.</P>
    <P>A table setting out the indicative funding breakdown and the implementing mechanisms proposed follows.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the Northern Ireland section of the programme will be finalised shortly and the complete draft will then be sent to the European Commission. I am confident that all concerned will ensure that the negotiation process will be completed expeditiously in view of the importance attached to this area.</P>

      <P>Under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, information about an identifiable individual is generally defined as personal information and, with exceptions, is not subject to be released to anyone other than the person to whom the information relates. An exception might be where the public interest is judged to be sufficiently strong to override considerations of confidentiality and privacy which may apply.</P>
      <P>However, where an individual holds office as a director, or occupies a position as a member of the staff of a public body, the terms upon and subject to which that individual holds the office or position concerned is specifically excluded from the definition of personal information.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, provided the body is a public body within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act, it is open to any member of the public to seek access to records containing the terms and conditions applicable to any director or member of staff of that body and this access would generally be granted. Of course, each FOI request is considered on its own merits and in accordance with the terms of the Act. If a public body refused to give access to such records, there are various appeals mechanisms and, in the final analysis, points of law may be decided by the courts. Obviously, where records are held by bodies not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the issue of such bodies releasing or withholding information under the FOI Act would not arise.</P>
      <P>The Government has recently approved a major extension of the Freedom of Information Act to encompass approximately 100 additional public bodies in the broadcasting, social services, health, cultural, environment, regulatory, enterprise and education sectors. It is anticipated that this extension will be completed not later than July 2001.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was prepared by Goodbody Economic Consultants, who were commissioned by the Dublin Employment Pact to draw up an indicative budget to tackle existing <Col N="200" /> gaps in the social infrastructure of the most disadvantaged areas of the Dublin region over the period of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>I have noted that many of the expenditure headings referred to in the report are encompassed in the social inclusion provisions of the NDP, including areas such as housing, sport and recreational facilities and child care. While the Deputy will appreciate that my Department does not have primary responsibility for the specific allocation of resources in these areas, I can assure him that the report has been brought to the attention of the various Departments and agencies currently involved in the formulation of the operational programmes necessary to give effect to the social inclusion proposals in the plan. I am sure that the report will be a valuable input to their consideration.</P>
      <P>As part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a targeted initiative for investment in infrastructure in disadvantaged urban and rural areas is to be developed. The report under reference will also be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sub-programme on social inclusion will form an integral part of each of the two regional operational programmes under the national development plan &ndash; NDP. These operational programmes are currently being drafted and will be finalised in the near future. The social inclusion sub-programme will comprise a range of measures including child care, equality, community development and family support, crime prevention, youth services and services to the unemployed. There are also a wide range of social inclusion measures under the NDP national or inter-regional operational programmes, in particular, the social housing and health capital sub-programmes under the economic and social infrastructure OP and a range of training and education measures targeted at the socially disadvantaged under the employment and human <Col N="202" /> resources OP. In total some £15 billion is provided in the national development plan to directly promote social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The main Departments which will be involved in implementing the social inclusion measures to be covered by the regional operational programmes are Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Social, Community and Family Affairs; Tourism, Sport and Recreation; and Education and Science. In addition, the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment will, as respective managing authorities, be involved in the social inclusion aspects of the operational programmes for economic and social infrastructure and human resources.</P>
    <P>The management of the regional operational programmes will be the responsibility of the two regional assemblies who have been designated managing authorities for their respective operational programmes. Departments and State agencies, who will be the bodies implementing the various social inclusion measures, will liaise closely with the Assemblies in this regard. To ensure co-ordination between these Departments and agencies at local level, and the maximum impact from all expenditure on social inclusion, a working group on social inclusion measures under the NDP has been set up under the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems, which is chaired by the Minister for Environment and Local Government. This working group is due to report shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the senior officials group which reports to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion. This group will be responsible for central co-ordination of social inclusion policies and programmes. Finally, the monitoring committees for each operational programme will be monitoring the impact of their particular programmes, sub-programmes and measures on an ongoing basis. These monitoring committees will have social partner representation including the community and voluntary pillar.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's objective to ensure that the social inclusion provisions in the NDP are effective and bring real benefit to the socially excluded in our society. This requires efficient delivery mechanisms. I am determined to ensure that the process I have outlined for the co-ordination of social inclusion measures under the NDP will work effectively so that the very significant level of State expenditure planned on these measures over the period of the plan will have maximum impact.</P>

      <P>As I said in my Budget Statement, I propose to modify the existing duty rebate on diesel fuel, which is available to CIE and certain other bus operators, by stipulating that this concession will only be available where low sulphur diesel is used. The motivation for this change is the Government's commitment to produce cleaner air. The relevant sections in this year's Finance Bill will be implemented by way of ministerial order later this year, allowing time for the interested parties to make the switch to the cleaner and more enviromentally sound low sulphur fuel.</P>
      <P>My officials have been informed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government that low sulphur diesel will be available in this country later this year. It is my experience that where tax incentives are provided, market forces will respond. Therefore, all transport operators currently enjoying very generous tax reliefs under the passenger road service fuel relief scheme should be able to find suppliers of low sulphur diesel in order to continue benefiting under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, following on the receipt of the report of the Companies Act authorised officer, an Ansbacher review team was established. In addition to the investigation of the 120 individuals named in the report, the position of a substantial number of associated persons &ndash; including individuals, companies and discretionary trusts &ndash; along with professional advisers and some financiers also has to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The investigation is complex due to the age of some of the transactions being investigated, the fact that some of the individuals named are deceased or are non-resident, and that other individuals are not clearly identified in the report. The work will require long and painstaking research.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, to date, a small number of the individuals concerned have admitted that there are additional liabilities. Another small number have indicated that the 1993 amnesty legislation was used to regularise their tax position. A majority of the other cases confronted to date have denied that there is any problem with their tax declarations. Inquiries in all relevant cases are continuing, using all appropriate powers. Given the complexities involved, it will clearly take some considerable time to bring the inquiries to completion.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question refers to tax evasion in the area of capital taxes, income tax, corporation tax and value added tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="206" /> that some 700 staff are engaged in audit and investigative work which can lead to the identification of cases of tax evasion. This represents about 11% of the total staffing of the office. Most of these staff are assigned to audit districts. Others are assigned to investigation branch, capital taxes division, and to special assignments, e.g. tribunal-related work, DIRT liability audits, Ansbacher inquiries. Cases may be processed to finality, regardless of size, in the areas where they were identified or may, in certain circumstances &ndash; depending on, for example, the complexity of the issues involved or possible prosecution considerations &ndash; be referred to specialist areas. Legal staff in the Revenue solicitor's office are available for advice and other support as necessary. Customs and Excise staff in the Revenue mobile service and the Customs Investigation Bureau may also be involved from time to time in tax evasion cases, especially in relation to VAT.</P>

      <P>Following the recent flooding along the river Shannon, the Government has been keeping the situation under review and has undertaken, where necessary, to bring forward appropriate measures. There are, however, no immediate plans to introduce a compensation package in respect of those affected by the flooding.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposal for the establishment of a statutory Shannon authority, I am conscious of the range of agencies with interests in and responsibilities for the river. As the Deputy is aware, the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, has just passed Second Stage in Seanad Éireann and is about to go to Committee Stage. Any decision to establish a Shannon authority on a legislative basis to oversee the management and control of water in the Shannon catchment will be done in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would point out that there is a proposed EU framework directive on water policy which will require that all aspects of water management be addressed on an integrated basis in relation to river basins. When the directive has been adopted it will be necessary to draw up comprehensive water management plans and put arrangements in place in relation to the co-ordination of all aspects of water management. These plans will, in relation to the management of water resources, include measures to relieve the effects of flood and drought.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue investigators are very conscious of the need to complete investigations and prepare a report for the DPP in the shortest possible time so that issues are brought to trial as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain matters involved in getting a case to hearing are, however, time-consuming or are outside the control of Revenue. For example, the matters under inquiry are often of a complex nat<Col N="208" /> ure, the necessary legal proofs may not be readily obtainable, and witnesses and institutions whose co-operation is required may not be forthcoming or co-operative. It should also be borne in mind that once cases reach the courts, Revenue has no control over the subsequent lapse of time before a case is actually tried. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the procedures for dealing with prosecution cases are under constant review in consultation with the DPP's office with a view to further refinements.</P>

      <P>The first Irish stability programme, which covered the period 1999 to 2001, was submitted to the European Commission in December 1998. The updated Irish stability programme for the period 2000 to 2002 was submitted to the European Commission in December 1999.</P>
      <P>After carrying out an assessment of the updated Irish programme, the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers &ndash; ECOFIN &ndash; delivered an opinion at its meeting on 31 January 2000.

The information thereby obtained is made available on request to interested public and private bodies.</P>
      <P>The exceptionally heavy rainfall in the area during the month of December 1999, which was estimated at twice the normal average, was the main cause of the flooding of homes and lands in and along the Shannon basin. There are no proposals to undertake flood relief works for the alleviation of flooding events such as those which occurred along the Shannon in recent months. Indeed, there have been several reports over the years on this matter which have led to a general consensus in relation to the Shannon that capital works to relieve flooding are just not viable.</P>

    <P>&ndash;increasing potential for cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>Strand B &ndash; Transnational co-operation, focusing on spatial planning.</P>
    <P>The priorities for Strand B may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>&ndash;spatial development strategies on a transnational scale and co-operation in promoting sustainable development;</P>
    <P>&ndash;efficient and sustainable transport systems and access to information society;</P>
    <P>&ndash;promotion of the environment and good management of cultural heritage and natural resources, in particular water resources;</P>
    <P>&ndash;to promote the integrated co-operation of the &ldquo;outermost&rdquo; regions of the EU.</P>
    <P>Strand C &ndash; Interregional co-operation to exchange experience through out the EU on themes covered by strands A and B.</P>
    <P>The priority topics for strand C are:</P>
    <P>&ndash;co-operative actions related to specific topics to be defined by the Commission, after consulting with member state committees in the area of research, technological development and SMEs;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the information society;</P>
    <P>&ndash;tourism, culture and employment;</P>
    <P>&ndash;entrepreneurship and the environment.</P>
    <P>The final guidelines for the INTERREG III programmes for 2000-06 are expected to be published by the Commission in March of this year.

      <P>The most recently published inflation figures for Ireland &ndash; January 2000 &ndash; show a year-on-year increase of 4.0% in the consumer price index &ndash; CPI &ndash; and a 4.4% increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices &ndash; HICP. The most recently published EU HICP was 1.7% for December; this compares with the December HICP figure of 3.9% for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The recent increase in the rate of inflation reflects a number of factors which include the fall in the value of the euro, the increase in crude oil prices which have added over 1% to inflation, and the budget increase in excise duty on tobacco, which was introduced for health promotion purposes, and which has added about 0.75% to inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Excluding the increases in oil prices and excise duty, which do not reflect the underlying trend, inflation in January was closer to 2%. As the impact of these special factors passes through it is expected that inflation will peak in the near <Col N="213" /> future and inflation should fall through the second half of this year.</P>
    <P>While I am, of course, monitoring the situation closely, the recent temporary increase in inflation has no significant implications for economic policy at this stage. The Government, of course, remains committed to ensuring that price and pay developments are consistent with sustaining competitiveness. In this context, the Government has just completed negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000. Adherence to these pay terms should help ensure that the rise in inflation is only temporary, and that we can maintain economic and social progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the self-assessment system of tax administration, responsibility for the submission of a correct tax return rests with the taxpayer. Revenue inputs the data on the tax returns into its computer systems, issues a notice of assessment to taxpayers and creates a tax charge or repays any tax overpaid, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Under the self-assessment system the majority of income tax payers file their tax returns with Revenue each year around 31 January &ndash; the return filing deadline. Inevitably, in this situation errors will arise in the processing of such a large volume of information. Revenue staff do, however, perform a routine level of checking or &ldquo;repair&rdquo; of tax returns before inputting the data into the computer systems, so as to try to eliminate some of the more common errors made by taxpayers or their agents. This procedure at the initial processing stage ensures many errors or omissions that would otherwise give rise to incorrect assessments are remedied, thus increasing the overall level of accurate tax assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the level of amendment made to assessments has been monitored for a number of years. In addition to the level of amendment, returns are also examined to determine whether amendments are attributable to mistakes by taxpayers and their agents or to mistakes by Revenue. The <Col N="215" /> results of this exercise for the most recent year available, 1997-98, are as follows: on average 15% of income tax assessments are amended once, while a further 3% are amended more than once. Responsibility for the errors giving rise to these amendments can be ascribed between taxpayers and their agents, on the one hand, and Revenue, on the other, roughly on a 50:50 basis. The corresponding figures for corporation tax are 9% of assessments were amended once, while a further 2% were amended more than once.</P>
    <P>Taxpayer errors or omissions can relate to genuine errors or to what is termed &ldquo;instalment filing&rdquo;, that is, some claims for relief are not included with tax returns when filed. These claims are made subsequently, resulting in an amended assessment.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the complexity of tax legislation and the fact that taxpayers, agents and Revenue staff are human and therefore capable of making mistakes, it appears that the level of accuracy of assessments is within acceptable limits. Initiatives such as Revenue's on-line service, which will cater for the electronic filing of returns, as well as its ongoing commitment to improved performance should result in further reduced levels of error.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government met the Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon on 19 January 2000 and the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly in Cork on 25 January. These meetings were a continuation of the wide-ranging process of consultation with regional interests which the Government engaged in when drawing up the national development plan. The particular purpose of the meetings was to ascertain the views of the assemblies on the main strategic issues facing their regions which needed to be addressed in the context of the formulation of the operational pro<Col N="216" /> grammes under the plan. The meetings with the assemblies were followed, in each case, by simultaneous consultation fora with a very wide representation of regional interests on the main themes of the plan, namely, economic and social infrastructure, the productive sector, including rural development, and human resources, including social inclusion.</P>
    <P>These meetings provided the opportunity for very fruitful exchanges of views between the Government and the assemblies and other regional representatives. The assembly speakers who participated in the discussions generally welcomed the overall thrust of the plan, its commitment to balanced regional development, and its provisions for each of the regions. The main strategic concerns expressed by the assemblies were: the need to ensure delivery of the planned infrastructure; the importance of improved road access within and between regions and to ports; the importance of parity of access of all areas to advanced communications; the importance of cultural, recreational and sports facilities in assisting balanced social and economic development; the need for better sub-regional spreads for tourism throughout both regions and for investment to lengthen the tourism season; the importance of rural development, in particular through diversification and provision of off-farm, income-generating activities; the importance of promoting social inclusion; the urgency of improving child care facilities.</P>
    <P>The national development plan addresses these concerns and the Government will ensure the necessary follow-up actions will be implemented through the operational programmes under the plan which are currently being drafted.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the up to date position with regard to the exercise they are carrying out on Irish registered non-resident companies is as follows: the examination of the 24,095 companies which failed to reply to the notices issued by the Revenue Commissioners in October 1999 is ongoing. As a first step, the companies are being checked against the Companies Registration Office  &ndash; CRO &ndash; list of companies <Col N="217" /> which have been struck off. This work is continuing but, so far, it has identified that 846 of the companies have already been struck off by the Companies Office.</P>
      <P>The first stage in the examination of the 9,389 cases in respect of which letters were returned to the Revenue Commissioners indicating that the addressee is unknown also involves a check against the list of companies which have been struck off by the Companies Office. Follow-up action includes establishing whether there are any new addresses on the Companies Office record. The work, so far, has shown that 639 of the companies have been struck off.</P>
      <P>Of the companies which have to be cross-checked against the CRO records, approximately 7,000 were incorporated prior to the early 1990s. The process of cross-checking these companies against the Companies Office records is time consuming as, at that time, companies did not have compatible Revenue and CRO numbers. Consequently, searches in relation to those companies have to be carried out manually in each case to identify the relevant CRO number.</P>
      <P>Revenue is aiming to complete all examinations in time to forward a list of cases by the end of March 2000 to the registrar of companies for initiation of strike-off procedures.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the engagement of services by Government Departments has to be carried out in accordance with EU law. Within that context, there is already much co-operation taking place between Departments here and in Northern Ireland. This extends in some cases to purchasing services where this can be done in a more cost efficient manner, thus delivering greater value for money, which is one of the guiding principles of public expenditure. Examples of this exist in the acute hospitals sector and in the engineering and design areas of public works. Structures exist between the two jurisdictions to continue and develop this co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that, as opportunities arise, careful consideration will be given to further purchasing, where it can provide value for money. In the new context of co-operation between Northern Ireland and the South, on foot of the Good Friday Agreement, we could see this developing further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1998, the Government Supplies Agency published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities inviting tenders for the supply of combat suits for the Defence Forces for the years 1999 and 2000. Publication of this notice is necessary to comply with Ireland's obligations under the government purchasing agreement of the World Trade Organisation and under EU directives on public procurement. These international obligations prevent the agency from specifying where the suits are to be manufactured, or from discriminating on the grounds of nationality in its assessment of tenders. Contracts must be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender.</P>
      <P>Twelve valid tenders were received, none of which offered garments made in Ireland. A contract was placed on 19 October 1998 with an Irish firm for garments to be made in China. This firm subsequently encountered difficulties in obtaining suitable fabric. In order to meet urgent requirements to equip a UNIFIL battalion travelling to Lebanon, a second contract was placed on 5 May 1999 with a Belgian firm for garments to be made in Romania. This contract has been completed satisfactorily. Deliveries under the first contract are expected to be completed shortly. I am satisfied that all appropriate procedures were followed in this case.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation's call for capital allowances for nursing homes to be ring-fenced to profits generated within the sector by those actively engaged in the industry on the basis that quality of care may not be met by passive investors. Issues relating to the quality of care rests in the first instance with the health boards and ultimately with the Department of Health and Children. For my part I am satisfied that the capital allowances provisions which I introduced in budget 1998 for the investment in nursing homes are an appropriate measure specifically designed to increase the supply of nursing home places. The nursing homes in question must be registered with a health board in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. However, if the Deputy or the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation are aware of any <Col N="219" /> case where these standards are not being complied with then either the relevant health board or the Department of Health and Children should be contacted.</P>

      <P>In the Betting Act, 1931, the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Finance. In general, the functions of the Minister for Finance are carried out by the Revenue Commissioners. However, as the Deputy will be aware from a reading of the Act, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform also has a role and responsibility in relation to the implementation of certain provisions of the Act. In sections 23, 29 and 34 of the Act there is a reference to officers of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. These officers would now be employees of An Post or Eircom.</P>

I expect that in the private sector the issue of whether a contractor is insured would be part of the vetting process before the contract is awarded.</P>
      <P>I consider that good health and safety procedures are equally important. The Health and Safety Authority implements the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations, 1995, which transpose an EU directive concerning minimum safety and health requirements on construction sites. These regulations constitute one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one specific industry.

The clothing industry is in a period of great change as the effects of a strong economy influence the economic factors underlying the sector.

The review group, whose report I launched recently, comprised the Irish clothing manufacturers federation, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and my Department.</P>
      <P>The review group's report concluded that outsourcing is a reality in the international garment market, a reality that must be accepted, particularly in the high volume low value sector. The report identifies the many challenges facing the sector. Developing new ways of attracting and retaining people in the sector, meeting competition from lower cost countries and identifying and developing new technologies and working practices are all identified as issues that need to be addressed. My Department will pursue the implementation of the recommendations in the report with the industry and State agencies. Enterprise Ireland will continue to support the clothing sector but will do so in a realistic and non-protectionist manner, recognising that activities such as outsourcing from lower cost countries are vital if the clothing industry is to survive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Community employment is a work experience programme targeted at persons 25 years of age or older and unemployed for a minimum period of one year. The current eligibility criteria were introduced in July 1999 following a detailed review of the programme and in response to the recommendations of the Deloitte &amp; Touche, report.</P>
      <P>The job initiative programme is targeted at the older long-term unemployed, that is, persons over 35 who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The recent report on the operation of the programme by Deloitte &amp; Touche recommended that the eligibility criteria remain unchanged. My Department has consulted with the social partners on this issue and there is broad agreement that the focus of the programme on the older long-term unemployed should remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>In general, it is desirable that programmes such as community employment and the job initiative have a specific focus as available resources must be targeted at those most in need. The majority of FÁS specific skills-mainstream training programmes have no restrictions with regard to age. Accordingly, I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the programmes for which I have responsibility.</P>

      <P>Jay Bee Limited, Carndonagh, County Donegal, advised employees on 16 February that owing to difficult market conditions and low cost competition, it has no option but to close the plant. The company currently employs more than 100 people and all redundancies will be implemented on a phased basis between mid-March and mid-April. FÁS will undertake a programme of registration interviews for the workforce who will all be offered re-training opportunities.</P>
      <P>Jay Bee Limited has been competing in the mid-market ladieswear sector, supplying formal blouses to many well known high street names in the UK. This product segment of the market has been under severe price competition from low cost imports and the sterling differential, coupled with a declining demand for the products caused by a shift to casual wear, changing lifestyles and a reduction in clothing expenditure. Given the high labour cost element, the company concluded that it is no longer cost effective to produce these garments in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has for some time been recognised that the clothing sector will continue to contract in terms of employment and the number of companies <Col N="223" /> involved. The Irish clothing industry is in a period of great change, as the effects of a strong economy influence the economic factors underlying the sector. Donegal has been particularly badly affected by the reduction in employment in the clothing sector. However, the Government is committed to finding replacement jobs for Donegal. As a result of intensive promotion of Donegal by Enterprise Ireland, I announced last week the details of a major investment package leading to the creation of over 200 new jobs for Donegal. Most of the jobs are in the internationally traded services area and all of them are in Irish companies.</P>
    <P>I met with the Donegal task force last week to discuss the implementation of its recommendations and other development opportunities for the county. The task force report has ensured that Donegal now has a head start on other counties in terms of devising an economic development plan and in ensuring the various public, private and community interests can continue to work together to ensure that the needs of Donegal are met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirements necessary to provide effective traceability of cattle are that all animals must be properly identified and registered, have valid passports-identity cards, be entered on a herd register and all movements throughout their lives must be recorded.</P>
      <P>In accordance with national and EU legislation, all calves born in a herd must be tagged within 20 days of birth  &ndash; since 1 January 2000 &ndash; or sooner if being sold on, with plastic eartags in both ears. Details of the birth of each animal must be registered by completing the animal birth registration form and posting it to the Department's birth registration agency, Bandon, County Cork within seven days of tagging.</P>
      <P>The animal birth registration agency will issue a passport to the owner-keeper following the receipt of a valid animal birth registration form. On receipt, the passport must be signed by the owner-keeper. The animal must be properly identified and be accompanied by its passport on each occasion it is moved and details of all owners-keepers must be recorded on this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the cattle movement monitoring <Col N="228" /> system is concerned, the system is based for the most part on notification of movements at the main collection points for cattle, viz. livestock marts, meat export plants, local authority licensed abattoirs and approved export points. Individual farmers must notify my Department of private sales and purchases, inter-farm transfers and on-farm deaths. They also have an obligation to quote the correct herd number in respect of transactions at marts, slaughter plants and export points.</P>
    <P>Details of all animals on the holding must be recorded in the on farm herd register and it must be kept up to date at all times. Details of births as well as all movements on to and off the holding must be recorded in this register. In addition, there is a section in the register to enable farmers to record details of treatments as required by the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996. Under these regulations farmers are required to keep in a specified format a record of all treatments which are designated prescription only, or have a withdrawal period. The purpose of this record is to ensure that consumers of beef products are not exposed to harmful levels of medicines.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all of these measures are necessary both to comply with EU legislation on identification and registration and to provide consumer assurance in regard to the traceability of an animal from birth and to ensure consumer confidence in the wake of the BSE crisis. While I appreciate that that the measures involve a number of forms and sets of records to be completed and maintained by farmers, I have sought to keep these to the minimum level possible within the constraints of the EU and national regulations.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in this case is that statistics are not maintained in a manner which would enable an accurate reply in a reasonable time frame to be given to the question raised.  The Deputy will recall that on 17 November 1999 he raised a question relating to the number of herds in each county on which a livestock scission report had been carried out to that date in 1999 and the number of herds amalgamated in each county and of these the number which were in existence prior to June 1992. Since the information sought was not readily available my Department wrote to the Deputy on 8 December 1999 giving the information.  It is reasonable to take into account the cost and time associated with assembling information and such an approach is not without precedent.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with An Bord Bia, the pigmeat sector has developed a strict code of practice to ensure that the quality of their product is of the highest standard. This code of practice is set out clearly in the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, which in addition to laying down strict guidelines for producers and processors, outlines the ways in which these can be achieved. Those who achieve the high standards required are granted membership of the scheme and are awarded the quality assured mark, which is visible proof of their commitment to quality. The scheme offers customers and consumers of Irish pigmeat assurances about the traceability, safety and integrity of the product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development: (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make changes in the system which operates in Ireland in order to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota on a permanent basis at a reasonable cost over the coming years and that the Irish dairy sector is positioned to face the competitive challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>On 13 October I announced my intention to introduce, by way of national regulations, applicable from 1 April 2000, an arrangement for the transfer of milk quota other than the current system whereby such quota transfers with land.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for: (i) more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime; (ii) greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers; (iii) the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible; (iv) greater competitiveness within the Irish milk production sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I secured additional quota under the Agenda 2000 agreement and 20.5 million gallons of this becomes available on 1 April 2000. The criteria for the allocation of this 20.5 million gallons are as follows: 15 million gallons will be made available to producers with quotas below 55,000 gallons who meet certain criteria. The criteria include a requirement that they must have produced 90% of their quota in two of the quota years 1995-98, that they have not sold or leased quota with land during the period in question, that they have not reduced their available quota in more than one year during the period and that they have acquired quota on a permanent or temporary basis during the same period. Five million gallons will be made available to a special scheme for younger active producers who have commenced milk production since 1989. The eligibility criteria for this category also include the 90% quota usage level as well as those related to the purchase and leasing of quota. Additional criteria in this category include an age limit of 35 at the date of commencement of milk production, educational qualifications and a maximum quota after allocation of 35,000 gallons. The maximum allocation to producers in this category will be <Col N="231" /> 5,000 gallons. The balance of 500,000 gallons will be set aside for exceptional cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect and unfortunately anyone who does not meet all of the eligibility criteria is not entitled to an allocation.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the allocation of the 15 million gallons is being administered by the dairy co-operatives in accordance with the criteria set by me.</P>
    <P>The closing date for receipt by milk purchasers of applications under the scheme for the allocation of five million gallons of additional quota to younger dairy farmers with a milk quota of less than 35,000 gallons was 8 February 2000. The milk purchasers will submit the completed application forms to my Department and they will be processed as quickly as possible. All applicants will be notified of the outcome.</P>
    <P>The additional quota will be available to successful applicants with effect from the 2000-01 milk quota year.</P>

      <P>Rates of payment under the scheme of early retirement from farming were reduced with effect from 1 January 1999 as a result of the introduction of the euro. Participants who had joined the scheme before that date had their payments reduced as a result, and it is to those participants that compensation has been paid, with the approval of the EU Commission, in respect of their losses during 1999. As the person named joined the scheme after 1 January 1999 her payments were not reduced and I regret that, therefore, she was not eligible for compensation.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations governing the quota regime, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven premium rights are required to use at lease 90% of that quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve. Quota leased out is regarded as quota <Col N="232" /> used but quota may only be leased out for three consecutive years. The person named held a suckler cow quota of nine premium rights. She leased out the quota in 1996, 1997 and in 1998. Because of the three year leasing rule, she may not have leased her quota again in 1999. The onus is on each farmer to ensure that they are familiar with the quota regulations which are clearly set out on the leasing forms completed by the person named in previous years.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I regret to say that the quota in this case has been returned to the national reserve.</P>

      <P>The rural environment protection scheme is an agri-environmental scheme whose objectives are to establish farming practices and production methods which reflect the need for environmental conservation and protection; to protect wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna; and to produce quality food in an extensive and environmentally friendly way. REPS, though not primarily a nature conservation and restoration scheme, contributes significantly to such objectives.</P>
      <P>The expertise available from within my Department and from other Departments and State organisations is, I believe, adequate to oversee the implementation of the scheme. Future monitoring and evaluation procedures will further enhance the contribution made by REPS to the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme is a broadbased scheme and the preservation of habitats is mandatory for all participants. Given that the existing scheme has some 44,000 participants whose holdings vary widely, the introduction of differing rates of payment for the various habitat types and the differing amounts of work involved would be impractical and potentially invidious to administer and implement. The introduction of such a system could also give the wrong impression that some types of habitat were more important than others. It is my view that equal environmental importance attaches to the preser<Col N="236" /> vation of all habitats and accordingly their preservation under the REP scheme is mandatory.</P>
      <P>While it is accepted that compliance with the conditions of the scheme may involve different amounts of work for different participants, this was taken into consideration when preparing a detailed analysis as required by the EU Commission of the justification for the different levels of payment under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Proposals for a new rural environmental protection scheme have been submitted to the European Commission as part of a draft rural development plan for the period 2000-2006. These proposals, which are subject to the approval of the Commission, include a provision for a higher rate of payment per hectare for smaller holdings not exceeding 20 hectares in total area. This proposal takes account of the recommendation in the evaluation report of July 1999, and is an effort to increase uptake of smaller holdings.</P>
      <P>As regards larger intensive farmers, the evaluation report of July 1999 referred to the option of relaxing nutrient guidelines in an effort to make the scheme more attractive to such producers. The report concluded that this would be regressive in environmental terms, however, as one of the objectives of the REP scheme is to promote the production of quality food in an extensive and environmentally friendly manner and such a course of action would undermine the message of environmentally friendly management that REPS is intended to promote.</P>
      <P>To make full participation in REPS financially attractive to larger intensive farmers, it is likely that basic rates of payment would have to be increased significantly. The funding available precludes this. In an effort to maximise the area of environmentally sensitive land farmed to the REPS specification, however, a new proposal has been included in the programme submitted to the Commission. This proposal is that farmers who have target area land but do not wish to participate in the general REPS programme may opt for payment on the target land area only, up to a maximum eligible area for payment of ten hectares, on condition that they implement a nutrient management plan in accordance with the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Nitrates on the entire holding.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for reducing by 50% the penalty for exceeding nitrogen limits under the revised terms and conditions for the REP scheme from 1 January 1999.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the revision of the REP scheme in January 1999, contracts for participants who exceeded the nitrogen limits were terminated and reimbursement of aid already paid was sought. A penalty of 25% was incurred by participants exceeding the phosphorous limits.</P>
      <P>The penalty for exceeding phosphorous limits was increased to 50% and the penalty for exceeding the nitrogen limits was revised to 50%. A 50% penalty is severe in monetary terms and has the advantage of maintaining errant participants within REPS so that they remain subject to the conditions and specifications. The environmental benefits which accrue from maintaining participants in the scheme far outweigh the negative environmental effect which might result from a policy of exclusion.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where it is apparent that no effort has been made to comply with the conditions, termination of the contract remains an option under the general provisions of the REP scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as direct payments in the form of arable aid and livestock premia are concerned, the Agenda 2000 agreement introduced a requirement on member states to take the environmental protection measures which they consider to be appropriate, based on a number of options, in relation to the land and production subject to the payments. One of these options is the observance of &lsquo;general mandatory environmental requirements'.</P>
      <P>In relation to compensatory payments, the Agenda 2000 agreement requires the beneficiaries to apply &ldquo;usual good farming practice compatible with the needs to safeguard the environment and maintain the countryside, in particular by sustainable farming&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have decided, in the light of Irish environmental conditions and, in particular, the extensive nature of Irish farming, that EU requirements in both cases referred to above can most appropriately be met by ensuring that existing national and EU environmental legislation is complied with. To this purpose, my Department's inspectors will, from this year, check for compliance when visiting farms for the purpose of implementing these schemes. In the case of compensatory payments, the arrangements have been submitted for approval by the European Commission in the Common Agricultural Policy rural development plan.</P>

    <P>The work of the TSG begins a number of months before the budget each year with the selection of the issues to be considered and proceeds with a weekly meeting of the group to consider papers prepared on these issues. While the deliberations of the group are purely advisory, they provide a very useful input into the budgetary process. The officials of my Department who are members of the group are also engaged in their day to day role of advising me on the wide range of mainly budgetary matters. It is not possible to distinguish between or quantify the time spent on these and TSG matters but it would represent a significant part of the time of the staff concerned in the run up to the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs and Excise (MiscellaneousProvisions) Act, 1988, includes sections dealing with search warrants in relation to controlled drugs and to contraventions of customs laws, levels of customs penalties, detention of certain goods and other customs-related matters. Specifically, it provides for officers of Customs and Excise to search premises following the issue of a search warrant by a designated district judge or peace commissioner.</P>
      <P>Under section 3 of the Act, a search warrant can be obtained to search premises or land for controlled drugs. Under section 5 of the Act, a search warrant can be obtained to search any, premises or place for books or documents reasonably believed to relate to transactions in contravention of the laws relating to customs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Customs officers in the past have applied for and used search warrants specifically provided for under each of these separate sections of the 1988 legislation. Warrants under Section 5 have been used to search private premises in connection with an EU levy. Applications for such search <Col N="245" /> warrants require specific authorisation by senior customs management and their subsequent execution is closely monitored and controlled by senior customs management. It is not clear what case the Deputy has in mind, but if he submits details I will have inquiries made and communicate the outcome to him.</P>

      <P>Section 15(4) of the Freedom of Information Act obliges public bodies to publish a range of information about themselves and their activities including their structures, rules and practices and any precedents maintained for the purposes of decision making. The new State directory will incorporate a summary of these individual publications by public bodies as well as the material previously provided in past editions of the publication. Work is currently ongoing on the publication and is now at an advanced stage. Barring any unforeseen difficulties I would anticipate that the revised State directory will be available from the Government Publications Office before the summer.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to ensure that building contractors' tax affairs are in order prior to them commencing work under any contract either in the public or private sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Building contractors tendering for work on projects funded by public money are subject to tax clearance. In the case of all public sector contracts of a value of £5,000, inclusive of VAT, or more within any 12-month period, and in the case of grants exceeding £500 for construction work, contractors are required to produce either a valid tax clearance or C2 certificate. To obtain tax clearance certificates applicants must have complied with their obligations regarding the payment and remittance of any taxes, interest and penalties and the delivery of returns due to Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the contract is with certain public bodies, principally local authorities, Departments and boards established by or under statute, the contract is subject to relevant contracts tax. This means that tax at 35% is deducted from payments to the contractor unless the contractor produces a C2 certificate to the public body and the Revenue Commissioners issue a relevant payments card, authorising payments to be made without deduction. A C2 certificate is issued only where the contractor's tax affairs and the tax affairs of certain associates &ndash; for example, partners, companies in which the contractor was a proprietary <Col N="246" /> director or employee &ndash; have been up to date over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Where the contract is in the private sector, relevant contracts tax also applies where the principal contractor subcontracts the work or where the contract is with a person who carries on a business which includes the erection of buildings or the manufacture, treatment or extraction of materials for use in construction operations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, contractors in the building industry are subject to the routine tax compliance and audit campaigns operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce a system whereby a contractor in the construction industry would be obliged to prove that his or her tax affairs are in order before commencing a contract in the private sector. The existing arrangements balance the State's need to protect its flow of tax revenues and the needs of business to function without an excess of regulation. However, the procedures relating to tax clearance for building contractors will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Section 268(1)(g) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for capital allowances in relation to nursing homes. These allowances apply in respect of capital expenditure incurred from 3 December 1997 on building new nursing homes, upgrading or extending existing homes or converting existing buildings into nursing homes. The allowance <Col N="248" /> is 15% of the capital expenditure in years one to six, with 10% in year seven.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Revenue that under the normal self-assessment rules any person seeking to claim capital allowances in respect of a qualifying building would submit their claim on the appropriate tax return form. However, the form does not distinguish between capital allowances claimed in respect of nursing homes from those claimed in respect of any other industrial building. Consequently it is not possible to indicate the level of take-up of this incentive.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Questions Nos. 159 and 166  on 15 February. A decision as regards the most appropriate course to pursue in a particular case is made by reference to all the circumstances of the case. Appendix 3 to the code of practice for revenue auditors, published in November 1998, lists the type of offences which are most likely to be prosecuted, including offences under section 9 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, and also lists, as follows, the factors which will be considered before the decision to investigate with a view to prosecution is taken: the strength of the available, or likely to be available, admissible evidence. It must be considered sufficiently strong to enable the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person was guilty of the alleged offence; the period of time since the alleged offence was discovered bearing in mid that delay in initiating proceedings may damage a case; the likely length and expense of a trial. The cost of pursuing prosecution should not be disproportionate to possible benefit to be obtained; the degree of culpability, responsibility, and experience of the alleged offender; the need for deterrence, both personal and general, in relation to particular offences; whether the alleged offender has made a full disclosure of the irregularities, has co-operated in reaching settlement and has paid all the tax, interest and penalties which are due; relativity &ndash; the apparent seriousness of the case in comparison with past prosecution cases and other cases under consideration.</P>
      <P>The list of criteria is not exhaustive but aims to give Revenue officials an outline of the type of offences which can be prosecuted and the factors which, alone or in combination, can influence a decision to investigate a case with a view to prosecution.</P>

      <P>The recent increase in the rate of inflation reflects a number of factors which include: the fall in the value of the euro; the increase in crude oil prices which have added over 1% to inflation; and the budget increase in excise duty on tobacco, which was introduced for health promotion purposes, and which has added about 0.75% to inflation.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the provision of convalescent care to persons who have completed the acute phase of their illnesses and who require a level of care more appropriate to their needs. Convalescent care is provided in community nursing units operated by health boards and in nursing home places contracted from private nursing homes.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing a nursing home place in a community nursing unit in the Dublin area is approximately £25,000 per annum, with this cost being somewhat less in other parts of the country. The cost of contract nursing home places also varies from region to region. However, in the eastern region I am informed by the Eastern Health Board that the cost is approximately £22,000 per annum. The reasons for this difference in cost include the higher staff ratio in community nursing units coupled with the higher levels of dependency of patients.</P>
      <P>Norms for health board services for older people were set out in the 1988 report entitled The Years Ahead &ndash; A Policy for the Elderly. The norms for long-term care beds outlined in this report have been met by health boards but with the increasing population of older people, it is widely accepted that there is a need for significant further investment in community nursing units, particularly in the Eastern Health Board region, to meet the needs of older people who require longer term care. In this connection, I am preparing a national strategy on services for older people which will include the provision of additional convalescent, respite and residential places when the need for such care is required together with a comprehensive range of support services in the community. Since this Government came in to office, significant additional capital and revenue resources have been invested in services for older people. Newly constructed community nursing units will be opening in the coming months in a number of locations throughout the country which will bring on stream approximately 300 additional extended care and respite places. I have earmarked resources as part of the national development plan to provide additional community nursing units as well as upgrading existing long-term care and other facilities.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, given to the provision of a graduated eligibility test for medical cards.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland has been primarily based on means rather than payment of income tax or PRSI. Since 1991 any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility &ndash; category 1, that is medical card holders or limited eligibility &ndash; category 2 &ndash; for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he-she satisfies the health board that it is his-her intention to remain here for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>The number of eligibility categories for entitlement to health services was reduced from three to two as a result of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991. This followed the detailed analysis of the eligibility system by the 1989 Commission on Health Funding and their recommendation of measures to simplify the system and make it more equitable. In particular, the commission found that there were major problems and inequities inherent in allocating non-medical card holders to more than one eligibility category on income grounds. These problems were removed when the new eligibility system came into effect. A graduated system of entitlement for medical cards would presumably have to be based on income and would thus reintroduce these problems.</P>
      <P>Under current eligibility criteria persons in category 1 are medical card holders and are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards <Col N="253" /> including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is £26 per night, up to a maximum of £260 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of £25 where the patient does not have a referral note from his-her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care. A maternity and infant care service is provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth. Hospital in-patient and out-patient services are provided free of charge to certain people including medical card holders and their dependants, woman receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks, all children aged under 16 who are suffering from a number of specified illnesses including mental handicap, phenylketonuria, and cystic fibrosis. Children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations, as well as people receiving services in respect of prescribed infectious diseases are also exempt from these charges.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

In the budget in December last year, an increase of 50p was put on a 20 pack of cigarettes. Price is a factor in young people deciding to take up smoking. This substantial increase should act to deter young people who are not already committed smokers and smokers alike.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>Financial assistance is not provided by my Department for the setting up of private nursing homes. However, in 1998, my colleague the Minister for Finance introduced a scheme of capital allowances for private nursing homes. The capital allowances apply to capital expenditure incurred from 3 December 1997 on building new nursing homes, upgrading or extending existing homes or converting existing buildings into nursing homes. The allowance is 15% of the capital expenditure in years one to six, with 10% in year seven. The allowances apply to nursing homes which are privately owned and registered with a health board in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. Provision has been made for a claw-back of the allowances where the building ceases to be used as a nursing home within ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also introduced a scheme of tax allowances for convalescent homes in respect of capital expenditure in the 1999 Finance Act. These tax allowances will be available for private step-down facilities which provide an alternative to hospital care for patients recovering from an operation or intensive hospital treatment. The allowances apply to expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 on the construction, extension or refur<Col N="256" /> bishment of a convalescent home as well as the conversion of an existing building into a convalescent home.</P>

      <P>The introduction of an accreditation programme represents a major advance in promoting quality improvement in the acute hospital sector and provides agencies with a tool to assess their performance on a continuous basis against an agreed set of standards. The overriding objective of the scheme is the achievement of real and measurable improvement by ensuring that hospitals are operating in a safe and qualitatively effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> I am pleased to inform the Deputy that funding of £1.2 million has been made available to date to support the development and introduction of the accreditation programme in the major academic teaching hospitals &ndash; MATHs. The accreditation programme will formalise standard setting and measurement across many aspects of a hospitals operations. The focus of the standards will be on the patient as he-she moves through an episode of care in the hospital. Standards will be developed around six interrelated functional areas applicable to each participating hospital: patient service groupings; leadership; information management; environment management; human resource management; and partnership.</P>
    <P>I understand that development work on the standards and other aspects of the scheme will be completed by the last quarter of this year and the programme will be rolled out across participating hospitals in 2001.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the accreditation programme, which I very much welcome, is the relationship which has been established between the MATHs group and the Independent Hospital Association of Ireland &ndash; IHAI &ndash; as the representative body for private hospitals in Ireland. The IHAI and the MATHs group began to develop an accreditation scheme at different times and from different standpoints. However, they are now actively pursuing measures to bring about convergence of their respective endeavours. In this regard I was pleased to learn that the IHAI has formally agreed to work with the MATHs group on the establishment of a single accrediting body for the Irish health sector.</P>

      <P>The proposed link road between Ardrostig Cross and Curraheen Road was not among the eight schemes included in Cork Corporation's application for funding under the specific improvement grants scheme in 2000. A subsequent request was received at end 1999 for special funding for this scheme in 2000.</P>
      <P>A total of four schemes submitted by Cork Corporation was approved for funding under the specific improvement grants scheme in 2000; these did not include the Ardrostig Cross/ Curraheen link road. The selection of the four schemes was made having regard to the eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme in 2000. Cork Corporation has been allocated a total of £2,963,000 in non-national road grants for 2000, an increase of 11% on its 1999 allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, PPP, generally precludes the subvention by the Exchequer of costs associated with the development, operation, closure and aftercare of local authority landfill facilities, and my Department does not provide capital assistance to local authorities for these purposes. In accordance with the PPP, a new directive on the landfill of waste will require member states to ensure that all of the costs involved in the provision of a landfill facility <Col N="261" /> are covered by the price to be charged by the operator for disposal of waste in the facility.</P>
      <P>The 1998 policy statement Changing our Ways emphasises that continuing undue reliance on landfill cannot remain the basis of modern waste infrastructure, and that reducing this reliance should be the core objective of the current local waste management planning process.</P>

      <P>I introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grants scheme twice in 12 months &ndash; in December 1998 and again last December. As recently as November 1998 the effective maximum grant payable under the scheme was £8,000 or two-thirds of the approved cost of the works in the case of private houses. Since then I have increased the maximum to £14,000 or 90% of the approved cost in the case of works commenced on or after 1 December 1999.</P>
      <P>I consider it preferable in general that grants be paid to applicants rather than a contractor, however, where an applicant would wish a grant to be paid directly to the contractor this can be arranged by the applicant assigning the grant to the contractor.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 118 of 27 January 2000, full access to bus lanes is at present permitted only to buses and large public service vehicles. Pedal cycles and taxis may use with flow bus lanes. Hackneys, as private hire vehicles, have not been permitted to use bus lanes in view of their more limited service role, which does not involve publicly standing or plying for hire. The Dublin Taxi Forum, while recommending some form of external identification for hackneys to facilitate enforcement of regulations by the Garda Síochána, nonetheless recommended against the merging of the separate service roles of taxis and hackneys, against roof signage for hackneys and against permitting access to bus lanes by hackneys. I have no proposals to extend the use of bus lanes to hackneys at this time.</P>

The Department is taking this matter up with the association.

    <P>The total allocation to Mayo County Council in 2000 of £11,931,000 is an increase of 8% on the corresponding 1999 allocation. Allocations to Ballina UDC, Castlebar UDC and Westport UDC have also increased since last year to £137,000, £137,000 and £187,000 from £114,000, £114,000 and £133,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>I am confident these significant increases in grant allocations will greatly benefit the non-national road network in Mayo county and urban districts.</P>

      <Col N="266" /> The Waste Management Act, 1996, places a general duty on holders of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner causing, or likely to cause, environmental pollution. It is a matter for waste holders to make appropriate arrangements for the recovery or disposal of waste. Arrangements for the disposal of health care risk waste arisings are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Health and Children. Under joint arrangements agreed between the Departments of Health here and in Northern Ireland a single contract has been awarded for management of this waste in both jurisdictions. I am advised that the new facility involved will be operational in March 2000 and, in the meantime, health care risk waste arisings will continue to be exported for disposal.</P>

In such cases, the normal requirement that an applicant should be a first-time purchaser and the limitation on floor area may be waived to allow a £3,000 new house grant to be paid. Disabled persons grants are not paid in respect of new houses in view of the fact that it is less costly to provide facilities for a disabled person in a new house than in adapting an existing house. In addition, when purchasing a new house to accommodate a disabled person the purchaser is better placed to choose a house which meets their needs without the need for extensive adaptation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering any issue relating to occupational pension schemes, it must be borne in mind that such schemes are voluntary arrangements usually introduced by employers following consultation with their employees.</P>
      <P>A distinction needs to be made between defined benefit and defined contribution occupational pension schemes. Under defined contribution arrangements, pension at retirement is determined by the accumulated value of contributions paid and the return from investment of those contributions, whereas in defined benefit schemes, the pension payable is linked to salary at retirement.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to research carried out by the ESRI in 1995 which indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, that: about 60% of members of defined benefit occupational pension schemes have their pension determined by their pensionable pay in the year before retirement and the remainder have it determined on the basis of average pensionable pay in the three years preceding retirement or some other basis; the rate at which pension benefits are built up is 1/60th of final pay for each year of service, subject to a maximum of 40/60ths of final pay.</P>
      <P>From the above, it can be seen that it is not normally in a person's interests to retire early, where the rules of the occupational scheme provide for such early retirement, as, in general, the longer a person remains in employment the higher his-her final salary will be resulting in a higher rate of occupational pension.</P>
      <P>While I am generally satisfied that where occupational pension schemes are provided by employers, they operate to the advantage of employees, I am concerned that the level of supplementary pension coverage &ndash; at 50% of those at work &ndash; is too low. The Pensions Board, in its report on the national pensions policy initiative, recommended that a target of 70% of the workforce over age 30 should have supplementary pension coverage. To achieve this target, the board recommended the introduction of a new pension savings vehicle, a personal retirement savings account. The board envisaged that this would be a low-cost, easy access personal investment account designed to allow people, regardless of their employment status, to save for retirement in a flexible manner.</P>
      <P>I intend to publish a new occupational pensions Bill by summer 2000 to fulfil the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. One of the main issues to be addressed in the new Bill will be a legislative framework for the introduction of the personal retirement savings accounts to facilitate increased savings for pensions and provide a vehicle to extend occupational pensions coverage overall especially to people who have no such cover at present.</P>

      <P>Free travel and free telephone rental allowance are available to carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of prescribed relatives and constant attendance allowance.</P>
      <P>Budget 2000 extends the free electricity allowance and free television licence to these groups, thereby qualifying them for all free schemes. In addition the free schemes will be extended to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition. Both of these measures will be implemented from October 2000 at an estimated full year cost of £6 million.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the role of caring can involve significant isolation and additional financial costs. The free schemes were extended to carers to support their role in providing care in the community, regardless of their household composition and income. However, there was no proposal that such allowances would remain in payment to non-care households and the review noted that the payment of non-cash benefits to carers could lead to a &lsquo;step-down' in income when the carer's payment ceased.</P>
      <P>That a carer is providing full-time care means a person, who is most at risk of being in institutional care, is being maintained in the community. Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. This policy has been affirmed by the extension of the free schemes to carers. However, entitlement to the free schemes ends when the full time care contingency and social welfare payment ceases.</P>

      <Quest>if he will guarantee the solvency of pension schemes which may be threatened by a statutory revaluation of all pre-1991 service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the report on the national pensions policy initiative, the Pensions Board regarded the extension of existing preservation of benefits requirements, to pre-1991 service as desirable and recommended that preservation of benefits for pre-1991 service should be introduced by 1 January 2001, revaluation of such benefits by 1 January 2006 and that funding standards in respect of these should be fully met by 2011.</P>
      <P>The pattern for the introduction of preservation and revaluation of pre-1991 service is similar to that adopted under the Pensions Act, 1990, which provides for the preservation and revaluation of post 1991 service.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that it may take some time for schemes to have fully funded the extended preserved and revalued benefits, schemes will not have to fully fund for these benefits until 1 January 2011.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to give effect to the board's recommendation in the new pensions Bill which will be published during the summer. This will mean that employees leaving schemes after 1 January 2001 will have a statutory right to the preservation, and revaluation from 1 January 2006, of benefits earned in respect of pre-1991 service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that in not extending the recommendation to all pre-1991 service, and in recommending a ten year period to achieve funding of the increased costs, the board struck a fair balance between the rights of pension scheme members and the potential solvency implications of placing additional and unplanned costs on schemes.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Development Plan 2000-2006, has now been published and includes an outline of the Government's proposals for the development of the tourism industry over that period. Under the plan, I have succeeded in obtaining in excess of £350 million specifically for tourism marketing, product development and training over the next seven years. The sector will also benefit, of course, from funding under a variety of other measures, including those relating to rural development, marine leisure, angling, cultural development and micro-enterprise.</P>
      <P>The plan provides for two regional operational programmes, the border, midlands and western, BMW, regional OP and the southern and eastern, SAE, regional OP, which will incorporate the specific provisions being made for the development of tourism product in these regions. Over the seven year period of the national development plan, £40 million has been allocated for this purpose to the BMW region. During this period, the strategy for tourism product development will be based on the needs of areas, having regard to whether they are already well developed tourism areas, or are still developing or underdeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>One of the main priorities for funding will be to support sustainable proposals to create quality tourist attractions of international appeal in developing and underdeveloped tourism regions; and to maximise return in terms of tourism revenue from existing attractions, especially those of smaller scale, by developing and packaging them into well defined regional &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; of visitor attractions, offering an interesting range and mix of product capable of attracting and retaining visitors in an area.</P>
      <P>These operational programmes, which will be published in the first half of this year, will outline in more detail the type of product eligible for support but it has not been decided if the operational programmes will give specific allocations to specific product categories &ndash; caravan and camping. Accordingly, it is not possible, at this stage, to give details of the type of products that will be eligible to apply for funding under the operational programmes.</P>

Upwards of 30 pools, including the pool in Castlebar, were identified as being in need of major refurbishment. To ensure these pools could be refurbished and brought to an acceptable standard, I secured additional funding of £36 million, commencing in 2000, for the Department's swimming pool programme, a minimum of £10 million per annum of which will be available this year and in the next two years to refurbish existing swimming pools.</P>

    <P>Civil, social and political education is now a compulsory subject at junior cycle in all recognised second level schools. The syllabus is <Col N="278" /> designed to allow schools to cater for the particular needs and concerns of their pupils. Schools are enabled, as they see fit, to address such issues as the possible danger for people of coming under the influence of undesirable or extremist groups.

      <P>As part of the minimum academic requirements specified by my Department for entry to primary teaching training all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a grade C, ordinary level, or grade D, higher level, in English in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent. My Department considers it to be the minimum standard in English necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach English to pupils at all levels of the primary school.</P>
      <P>While there no plans to amend this requirement, requirements in this area are kept under review by my Department in consultation with the authorities of the colleges of education.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot make exceptions to the entry requirements in individual cases.</P>

      <P>Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann has been engaged in a continuous programme of research on the teaching and learning of Irish at primary level for many years. Much of the work has been conducted in association with the primary inspectorate. A major report on ten years of this research by Dr. John Harris and Ms Lelia Murtagh was published by ITE last May.</P>
      <P>Materials specially designed for teaching Irish at primary level using a communicative approach were developed by Dr. Harris and his colleagues and were tested out by a large group of teachers over a two year period. The results of this study, which was commissioned by the NCCA, were used in the development of the revised curriculum for Irish in primary school. The communicative teaching materials developed in the course of the project were published as part of a research report by ITE and are being used in many schools at present.</P>
      <P>Other research on ways of supporting and involving parents in their children's learning of Irish at primary level is continuing in ITE at present.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is responsible for the development and review of syllabi for primary and post-primary schools. In carrying out this work, the council draws on the experience and specialist knowledge of teachers, university personnel, educational managers and parents. It also draws on the findings of up to date research.</P>
      <P>A special working group, chaired by an assistant chief inspector of my Department, has been established to review the present situation in relation to Irish at junior cycle. It will have regard to student interest and motivation in Irish; teaching and learning approaches to Irish and the societal influence impacting on the learning and teaching of Irish. It will conduct research, draw conclusions and make recommendations with a view to ensuring standards of Irish at junior cycle, foundation and ordinary levels, are such that Irish continues as a living language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised syllabus in Irish for primary <Col N="280" /> schools and syllabi at second level are such that authentic materials drawn from such sources as television, radio, newspapers and magazines can be used to good effect in learning and teaching the language. As with any language, progress in the learning of Irish would be greatly enhanced by the wider use of the language in everyday life and by the existence of a supportive community environment. The availability of television programmes in Irish is widely recognised as being supportive, particularly when they take account of young people's needs, interests and language competencies.</P>
    <P>While the Irish syllabi are underpinned by the same principles as those pertaining to the other modern language syllabi taught in our schools, my Department has not carried out a study comparing Irish with those languages.</P>

      <P>The latest information available from the institutes of technology indicates that they are currently catering for 147 groups of apprentices and that it is expected to increase this provision to 152 groups in the third term of this academic year. Details are given in a table which will be included in the Official Report. A group, which normally consists of 16 apprentices, attends the institute for a term, which for most trades is ten or 11 weeks and there are three terms in the academic year. On this basis 152 groups would equate to an annual capacity of nearly 7,300 apprentice places. Details are not available in my Department of the actual numbers of apprentices attending the courses. However, I understand from the institutes that most groups operate to full capacity. In a small number of cases places may be vacant where apprentices are unable to attend for personal or other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of groups catered for by the institutes is subject to adjustment from term to <Col N="281" /> term in the light of a range of factors, demand, availability of facilities and staff. My Department is working closely with the institutes to increase capacity as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>A substantial range of inservice courses is provided for teachers involved in remedial and special education who educate pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, there has been a national programme of training in the remedial area for serving teachers at primary and post-primary levels. Under this programme teachers attend postgraduate diploma courses in the following institutions: St. Patrick's College of Education, Dublin, DCU, Church of Ireland College of Education, Dublin, National University of Ireland, Cork, National University of Ireland, Galway, Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, UL, and St. Angela's College of Education, Sligo, outreach from Mary Immaculate College. The number of graduates from these courses over the two years 1998 and 1999 was 148 and 158, respectively. For the year 1999-2000, 172 applicants were given places on the courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many shorter courses for teachers in the remedial and special education areas are financially supported by my Department. These are provided mainly through the network of education <Col N="283" /> centres, teachers' organisations and the programme of summer courses for primary teachers. Further inservice will be provided to meet evolving requirements in the area in question.</P>
    <P>The existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs.</P>
    <P>Students undertaking the bachelor of education degree or the graduate diploma in education, primary teaching in St. Patrick's and Mary Immaculate colleges of education now follow a course module on special education. This module covers the broad range of issues in special education.</P>
    <P>In the Church of Ireland and Coláiste Mhuire, Marino colleges of education, particular attention is paid to special needs and learning difficulties arising from various factors under &ldquo;method studies&rdquo; in English and mathematics. In the case of the Froebel College of Education, students have a course module under &ldquo;remedial work&rdquo;. This deals with learning difficulties arising from special needs. At second level, there are inputs to the Higher Diploma in Education, as part of a general alertness orientation programme, on a variety of learning difficulties which pupils may have.</P>
    <P>Review groups were set up in 1999 to examine pre-service teacher education programmes for primary and post-primary teachers. The group for each area is required to have regard to developments in relation to catering for children with special needs. The reports of both groups are due to be completed later this year.</P>

As Minister for Education and Science I have no role in this matter.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Higher Education Authority that it has not received any proposals for specific funding either for an increased biotic input into the environment resource management course or the development of an ecology degree.

    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> Minister for Education and Science </P>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): In 1974 my Department issued a circular to the relevant school authorities advising them that it was proposed to discontinue the award of the art teachers' certificate based on the results of the technical schools examinations in art. In 1980 schools were informed that the award of qualifications in art would henceforth be a matter for the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>In 1981 my Department considered the question of providing a summer course to cater for persons with a minimum of three years' teaching experience who held the principles of teacher art qualification but who had a shortfall of one or more of the necessary TS examinations in art. It seems there was insufficient interest to justify holding the course at the time. However, the TS examinations in art continued to be held up until 1988.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently re-examining the matter with a view to determining whether it is possible to address the shortfalls in the qualifications of any unqualified teachers currently employed so as to enable them to become qualified to compete for permanent posts. A decision in this regard will be taken as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Schools running costs are met by the Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. The capitation grant has increased substantially since the Government assumed office in 1997. It was increased by £5 in 1998 and £10 in 1999, bringing the standard grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes an increase of 33% over that period. In addition, the grant will be increased by a further £11 by the end of the 2000-01 school year.</P>
      <P>These increases represent a meaningful response to the funding needs of primary schools. I remain committed to further improving the funding position of schools in the context of forthcoming budgets and in the light of available resources.</P>
      <P>The running costs of primary schools are not budgeted for individually by my Department and it would not be feasible to grant aid more than 3,000 schools in such a manner. In the circumstances I regret that I am not in a position to provide the type of funding sought by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education equality unit published a report &ldquo;Who Cares in the Campus?&rdquo; on child care provision in higher education institutions in Ireland in November 1999. The report found that of the 40 institutions that responded to the 1998 all-Ireland survey, 30% provided child care support of some kind. The majority of these institutions provided child care support for both staff and students and the university sector accounted for 83% of the institutions with child care provision. The higher education equality unit concluded that the availability of quality, reliable and affordable child care is a key equality issue. It recommends the provision of child care facilities and-or child care grants to facilitate student parents participation in higher education and to facilitate equality of opportunity among staff members. The report noted that there were indications that the provision of child care is becom<Col N="287" /> ing a more activated issue in some sectors of higher education, with two of the universities having plans to build crèche facilities and the issue of child care provision being under consideration in a number of institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority also addressed the question of child care provision in its guidelines for the development of student support services, which it provided to third level institutions in 1998. These guidelines recommend the provision of crèche facilities on site and where this is not possible, the provision of financial support for students who have to seek child-minding facilities off campus.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the question of providing child care facilities in third level colleges is primarily a matter for the individual third level colleges. The report referred to earlier identifies the different levels of provision currently being made and identifies a number of issues for consideration by the colleges. Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware of the Government's plan to invest more than £250 million in the national development plan on the development of a national child care infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In relation to steps being taken by my Department, my Department's guidelines on the ESF aided student assistance/access fund for third level institutions refers to the possibility of assisting students with family responsibilities, particularly in relation to child care costs, who face significant financial difficulties. As the Deputy may be aware, this fund amounted to £1.296 million in 1999 and represents a significant increase on previous provisions.</P>

      <QRef>[5555/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, was introduced specifically to relieve some of the supply pressure for student accommodation by providing a scheme of tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector. Properties qualifying for relief under the scheme are campus areas of the educational institution, or areas, within an eight kilometre radius of the main campus, which are approved by the educational institution as being an area within which a qualifying development may take place.</P>
    <P>Under these provisions I am satisfied that the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students. In these circumstances as the third level colleges are <Col N="288" /> autonomous institutions the Department has not conducted an analysis of the availability of a land bank within third level colleges which could be released for the construction of purpose built student accommodation under the tax provisions of the recent Finance Act or otherwise.</P>

      <P>In relation to the value of the higher education grant, I intend to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year. I also intend to continue the practice in recent years of increasing the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases to the value of maintenance grants can be considered only having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that more than 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. I am developing proposals in relation to these financial supports and I will be announcing the details of the new arrangements in due course. </P>

I am developing proposals in relation to these financial supports and I will be considering the administrative arrangements in this context.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, there are major implications, for example, for the local authorities and vocational education committees, in any proposals to change the administration of the schemes.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>All teachers in primary schools were issued with a new programme in science in September 1999 as part of the introduction of the revised curriculum. The programme is set out in two booklets &ndash; a curriculum statement, incorporating the aims, objectives and content for each class level and guidelines for teachers on the teaching of the subject. The new science programme comprises four interlinked strands, namely, living things, energy and forces, materials and environmental care.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the revised curriculum will be on a phased basis over four to five years and will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in-career professional development for teachers. The expectation is that most schools will choose to follow the sequence of subject-areas followed in the in-career development programme from year to year. It is planned that in-career professional development in science will form part of the ongoing primary curriculum support programme in the next school year, 2000-01. However schools will be free to introduce subject areas as they see fit, taking account of the expertise and interests of their staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To encourage schools to incorporate science in their curriculum, schools were issued with grants in October 1999 to assist them with the purchase of science teaching equipment and materials. These grants amounted in total to approximately £1.75 million. The size of grant varied with the size of school: however a minimum grant of £400 was paid to schools of less than 50 pupils while schools of more than 500 pupils received the maximum grant of £1,000. A circular that was issued at that time indicated the types of equipment and materials that the grant could be <Col N="290" /> expended upon. Schools are required to keep a record of all equipment purchased with the grant, and may carry forward the unexpended amount to meet later needs.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at present to quantify the number of primary schools that offer science as a formal module of the curriculum. There is no doubt, however, that their number will continue to grow as teachers become more familiar with the contents of the revised curriculum statements and guidelines and as more and more teachers are given the opportunity of attending in-career development seminars in the subject during the next school year.</P>
    <P>As part of the in-career development programme all schools will be asked to identify the elements of science currently being taught with a view to planning for full implementation of the science module of the curriculum. This obviates the need for a separate survey at this time.</P>
