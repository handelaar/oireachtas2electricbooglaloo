    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 29, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the special European Council meeting on 13 and 14 October in Biarritz with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The Cabinet Committee on European Affairs met on 11 October in preparation for Biarritz and on 8 November in preparation for the EU-Balkan Summit which took place in Zagreb on 24 November. It will meet again on 5 December in preparation for the Nice European Council. I also held a number of meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Attorney <Col N="1280" /> General and officials on the detail of the negotiations and will do so again later this week.</P>
    <P>The informal summit meeting in Biarritz, devoted principally to the Intergovernmental Conference, also discussed the Charter of Fundamental Rights and some additional issues, including recent oil market trends and, of course, the welcome developments in Serbia and the latest events in the Middle East. As had been decided in advance, given the informal nature of the summit, no written conclusions were issued.</P>
    <P>The meeting afforded leaders the first opportunity under the French Presidency to discuss the issues arising on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. Discussions focused on the size of the Commission, QMV, reweighting of votes and flexibility. I am pleased to say that solid progress was made on this agenda by the Council and all leaders restated their determination to reach an agreement at Nice.</P>
    <P>On the size of the Commission, there remains a clear distinction between the position of the five larger member states who wish to see a cap on the number of commissioners and the other member states who continue to insist on one commissioner per member state. I emphasised again the importance of maintaining the right of each member state to nominate a commissioner and restated my belief that the Commission will be stronger and have greater legitimacy if it includes a national from each member state. I believe the legitimacy of Commission decisions in the eyes of the public is greatly strengthened by the fact that the Commission includes not a representative but someone who is familiar with conditions in individual member states.</P>
    <P>Together with the other smaller and medium sized member states, I rejected the contention that a Commission with one representative per member state will be inefficient or unable to operate. We and others are ready to consider internal reforms by enhancing the role of the Commission President, including some limited increase in the number of Vice-Presidents. However, to secure agreement, any proposals in this area must, of course, be on the basis that the collegiality of commissioners is maintained.</P>
    <P>As to the reweighting of votes, we are prepared, as envisaged in the Amsterdam Protocol, to consider some modest reweighting in a situation where the five larger member states are prepared to forego a second commissioner, and the right of each member state to nominate a commissioner is assured into the future. While we have tended to favour a dual majority model, an equal number of member states are now supporting a simple reweighting of the current system, which so long as it is measured I have agreed to consider in the interests of facilitating consensus and in the context of a balanced package.</P>
    <P>The discussion on the possible extension of QMV was based on an informal note circulated by the Presidency which focused on the remaining areas of major difference notably taxation, social policy, JHA matters, anti-discrimination <Col N="1281" /> matters and common commercial policy. I indicated that we were well disposed to extending QMV on several articles, including provisions relating to transport, industrial policy, structural funds and certain appointments, and have reduced to a handful the number of issues where we find it essential to retain unanimity. A consensus is now emerging among member states for a substantial move towards QMV.</P>
    <P>However, I insisted that all aspects of taxation policy must remain subject to unanimity and emphasised that it is essential that national governments, which remain responsible for the management of their economies, retain control in this vital area. I highlighted my view that in practice it would be almost impossible to ring fence certain aspects of taxation, or to pretend that changes in one area will not have an impact across the board.</P>
    <P>In relation to closer co-operation or flexibility, debate on this issue has progressed quickly since it was added to the Intergovernmental Conference agenda at the Feira European Council with member states indicating a willingness to positively consider easing the rules for participation. I indicated that while we are prepared to examine easing the rules, we have to ensure that it does not develop in a manner which facilitates the emergence of a multi-speed Europe. In particular, proposals to extend flexibility to the second pillar could, in the absence of adequate safeguards, cause fragmentation and hinder rather than help the integration process. For Ireland, the coherence and unity of the Common Foreign and Security Policy is fundamental.</P>
    <P>I was pleased the summit recognised that any movement in this area must not call into question the Single Market or the cohesion of the Union and should act as a force for integration.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I am pleased that in the light of substantial improvements made in the final text of the charter, I was in a position together with other leaders to endorse it as a political document at the summit. It was agreed that the charter will be formally proclaimed at the European Council in Nice.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the charter, as originally envisaged at the European Council in Cologne and which I fully supported, was to draw together the existing rights of the Union's citizens. The nature of the convention, its procedures and the timescale it has operated within, were such that a political document only could be produced. Clearly, if a legal document were to be created, far more extensive work would be required to ensure compatibility with national constitutions, legal systems and traditions.</P>
    <P>Our concerns with the charter, which were reflected by the positions adopted by my representative to the convention drafting the charter, related, in particular, to the risk of creating parallel and competing human rights regimes and to consequent conflict in jurisdictions and jurispru<Col N="1282" /> dence as between the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>There was also a brief discussion of a Commission document on oil markets which outlined a strategy for the management of the Union's oil supply. It recommended that efforts be made to increase oil supply both from OPEC countries and from closer co-operation with Russia; that alternative sources of energy be examined; and that consideration be given to increasing the Union's strategic reserves of oil. I gave my support for the approach outlined and indicated that we should strive to ensure a better co-ordinated response to any future oil crisis.</P>
    <P>President Kostunica of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia attended the closing lunch of the Biarritz Summit. I wrote to him in advance of seeing him at Biarritz where I congratulated him on his victory. I took the opportunity to assure him of Ireland's full support for his efforts to restore democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in Serbia. I was pleased the Union declared it would do everything possible to assist Yugoslavia in its return to democracy. I informed him that I looked forward to strengthening relations with the Federal Republic, both within the Union and bilaterally. I will also press for the earliest possible implementation of the decision to move towards the full normalisation of relations with the Union. I was pleased to invite him to visit Ireland in due course.</P>
    <P>President Kostunica also attended the Zagreb Summit meeting between the EU and the five Western Balkan states of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Discussions at the summit focused primarily on relations between the EU and the Western Balkan countries. The summit, which was jointly chaired by President Mesic and President Chirac, marked a further stage in the development of relations between the EU and the Western Balkans regions. The declaration adopted by the summit reflects the mutual commitment of the EU and Balkan states to the achievement of enhanced relations and economic, social and political development. The summit also marked the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the EU and Croatia, and the conclusion of an agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
    <P>The summit also provided an opportunity for EU leaders to assess President Kostunica's progress in consolidating his position and the development of his relations with other key figures, such as President Djukanovich of Montenegro. I am confident the summit not only recognised the progress already made in developing EU-Balkan relations but will be seen to have provided a fresh impetus for the development of trade relations between the EU and the Balkan region and also between the Balkan nations.</P>
    <P>During the summit I met President Trajkovski of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I congratulated the President on the initialling of <Col N="1283" /> the Stabilisation Agreement between his country and the EU. President Trajkoski outlined to me his hopes for the development of closer links between FYR Macedonia and the EU and its member states. I assured the President of Ireland's support for the development of such links and offered to share the experience of our industrial development agencies through exchange visits by the relevant personnel.</P>
    <P>Given the worsening situation in the Middle East, leaders at Biarritz issued a declaration on the state of the peace process. We appealed to the Israeli and Palestinian people to bring an immediate end to all violence. The declaration emphasised that for the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority there is no way other than peace and negotiation on the basis of what has been achieved at Camp David.</P>
    <P>I held a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Blair on the margin of Biarritz and <i>en route</i> to Zagreb summits. We took the opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland and many of the issues which were considered in detail at these summits.</P>
    <P>I met the Bulgarian Foreign Minister, Mihaylova, in Dublin on 5 October. We discussed enlargement and the situation then in Serbia. I took the opportunity to re-emphasise the Irish Government's support for enlargement and indicated that Ireland would be happy to assist Bulgaria in its accession process.</P>
    <P>My address to the European Movement Ireland on 6 November, which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library, afforded me the opportunity to elaborate on the Irish position on many of the institutional issues which I have already outlined and to situate Ireland in the debate which will take place after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference on the future of Europe. My speech makes clear the reasons for the positions Ireland is adopting at the Intergovernmental Conference. I outlined our overall approach and attitude to the process of European integration and to the enlargement of the Union. I am pleased reaction to the views set out in the speech have proven generally positive and indicate that Ireland remains at the forefront of thinking on the development and role of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Chancellor Schüssel of Austria made a working visit to Dublin on 23 November. Coming just two weeks before the Nice European Council, our meeting focused on the Intergovernmental Conference, enlargement, security and defence and the Stockholm European Council. In my discussions with the Chancellor, I outlined the Irish position on the items on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda. Austria and Ireland share similar views across a broad range of the issues under discussion and the Chancellor and I undertook to work together to put across a common position on several items at Nice. I will also meet Prime Minister Verhofstadt of Belgium in Dublin tomorrow, 29 November, to discuss the issues <Col N="1284" /> arising at Nice. In addition, I will meet President Chirac of France on 30 November as part of the Presidency's tour of capitals in advance of Nice. This meeting will focus on the items on the agenda for Nice and, I expect, our work together on SECCO in the coming two years.</P>
    <P>I have not received a formal agenda for Nice. Clearly the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference will figure predominantly. In addition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Security and Defence developments, I expect enlargement to be discussed in light of the European conference which will take place with the candidate states on the first morning of the summit. Issues such as the Union's social agenda, the employment action plan, employment guidelines and maritime safety, together with the situation in the Middle East peace process, are also likely to arise.</P>

      <P>Whatever about creating a multi-speed Europe, I congratulate the Taoiseach on his speed reading technique which has been developing and seems to be at a zenith.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the outcome of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Is it true that he was in the minority of leaders who strongly opposed giving the charter legal effect? How will environmental sustainability and children's rights be given effect as a basic political declaration? Where does the European Charter of Fundamental Rights end and the Council of Europe Court of Human Rights begin? Do they overlap or have they got separate jurisdiction? Does the Taoiseach regard this as an attempt to provide a framework for a constitution for a new European super state, given that there is already a common currency and that there is the appearance of a common army in formation? Is that what this charter is about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept Ireland is in the minority in this regard. An enormous amount of work was done in a short time on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Much more was achieved than was envisaged at the outset. The charter was submitted by the convention which was established to draft it at the end of September. Given the timescale, an enormous number of amendments and sections were being introduced up to the last few days. We were able to agree this because the final draft text took on board the concerns we had expressed, particularly in relation to the possible conflict with the role of the European Court of Human Rights. We argued that point at the very last meeting. I discussed the background to that matter some weeks ago with Deputy De Rossa. I believe we dealt with the matter satisfactorily at that stage, given the way the amendments were being brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question referred to his concern and the duplication which could arise from it. This matter has been debated in the media nationally and internationally. Our concern <Col N="1285" /> regarding the possibility of competing jurisdictions and interpretations of the charter arose from the possibility that the European Court of Justice and the Council of Europe Court of Human Rights might refer to the charter as a political document agreed between all member states, in reaching decisions on cases. A difficulty could arise from different interpretations. The legal interpretation is clearly set out by the European Court of Justice and those rights are extended in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. All countries agreed. The matter was rushed and difficulties arose because of that but it is a good charter and a readable document.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked if it would proceed to become a legal document. Many people would like to see that happen. The European trade unions group lobbied for it and continues to do so. However, for time reasons it was not possible. It was not referenced back against the constitutions or legal systems of member states and it was not dealt with as a legal document. The debate will continue and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>As far as Nice is concerned, there may be a reference. Some people want to see that and some do not. It is unlikely it will happen in Nice but the charter will not end where it is, as a political document. There will be further discussion and member states will be asked to look at their constitutional, legal or traditional positions. In time, it will become a document which, if not a constitution, will set down clearly what people's rights are at present and how they will extend into the future. That is no bad thing.</P>

It was not on any other basis. Our involvement in these missions was also on the basis of the UN mandate and assumed that the UN had given approval for them. That has been the basis of this discussion throughout and will continue to be so. We will be involved, on a case by case basis and under the ambit of the Petersberg Tasks, in crisis management and humanitarian issues and that the Irish forces, as they have since 1959, would continue to engage in that provided it is the desire of the Security Council. It is not our wish to take our line from anywhere other than the UN. That has been our clear position for several years &ndash; it is understood and respected and continues to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, Deputy Quinn. I appreciate this because it is impossible to follow any sequential line of questioning if one does not have the opportunity to intervene.</P>
      <P>Is it not the case that Ireland could not have participated in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation since it did not have a UN mandate because of a Russian veto? Is it not the case, therefore, that in saying there must be a UN mandate for any EU peacekeeping operation in which Ireland takes part, Ireland is, in fact, saying Russia and China have the final say on what we do, or do not do, as far as European peacekeeping is concerned?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this issue is entirely separate from the Petersberg Tasks &ndash; a separate decision from what is, or is not, in the Petersberg Tasks? Does he agree that the Petersberg Tasks include peace making &ndash; in other words, intervention in a war to restore peace &ndash; and that it is very difficult to distinguish that from any other normal military intervention in any conflict? Is it not the case that peace making is one of the Petersberg Tasks, that it is not all just humanitarian goody goody stuff and that there is actually peace making in it? What is the difference between that and any conventional military operation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach three related questions in the recognition that there is a difficult task ahead for all the governments. The outcome from Nice is far from certain at this point. Is the Taoiseach of the view and will he give a commitment to the same that Ireland will work towards having some reference made to the political document so described, the Charter on Fundamental Human Rights, linked in the treaty text coming out of Nice which would call on, require, or, in some way, introduce a dynamic into the treaties that would require member states in the future to incorporate the values and <Col N="1288" /> the principles of the charter into domestic legislation, including constitutions? It is a complex legal area, but it loses its value if it remains only a political statement. My first point relates to some dynamic sentence in the conclusions in Nice.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to Ireland and the Commission. As the Taoiseach is aware, there is thinking abroad that after the Commission term of 2005 to 2010, the automatic entitlement of each member state to a Commissioner would be up for review and there could be some form of rotation. Will the Taoiseach ensure that such a proposed rotation does not take place? The efficiency or otherwise of a body of 27 Commissioners is not challenged because of the number. The representational and iconic role played by Commissioners, particularly for small member states, will be as important after 2010 as it is now.</P>
      <P>My third point relates to a European Parliament comprising 27 member states, which is the figure currently in use, and a ceiling of 700 Members. Will the Taoiseach indicate what level of representation the Republic of Ireland will have in terms of the reduction in numbers? Every member state will have to reduce the number of MEPs it elects to accommodate that shrinkage. Ireland currently has 15 MEPs. What is the Taoiseach's position on the residual number of Irish MEPs in an EU comprising 27 member states and a European Parliament with 700 Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first issue of fundamental human rights, I accept all the work done in this area would be for nothing if it became only a document on a shelf. That would be of no value. It cannot become a legal text at this stage because it was drawn up on a different basis. However, this should not prevent ongoing work. People are pleasantly surprised that the text is good, readable and useful. However, it requires more work, and there should be a reference to that ongoing work.</P>
      <P>It cannot be dropped; that would be unfair to the people who put in all the work. My feeling is that it will be included. If the Deputy had asked me a few weeks ago, I would have said that perhaps it would be linked to Article 6 in some form. That may still happen, but others are against such a move. However, it should be linked.</P>
      <P>Regarding the argument about economic and social rights, as I said over the past year and in Biarritz, our contention is that they are different but not inferior to civil and political rights. It has been the view of the European trade union movement that the economic and social rights are not lost. In our view, the civil and political rights in the charter are traditionally referred to the courts for interpretation. The issue can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's third point related to the numbers. If the European Parliament motion is accepted, Ireland would lose six Members. Needless to say, we have argued against it. If there was an across the board balance, Ireland would lose three Members. I am more attached to that <Col N="1289" /> suggestion; I totally rejected the other suggestion. I hope that is where it will fall. Undoubtedly, we will lose some Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. In terms of the way it is weighted in the European Parliament, smaller countries proportionately would lose most unfairly. In such a scenario, Ireland would lose six Members. On a straight balance, while there may be a difference about whether it should be three or more, there is a sustainable argument for three.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Commission, as the Deputy is aware, there have been almost as many proposals as clauses in the treaty. The line we have taken is that we are working towards an outcome which will protect our right to nominate a Commissioner. We are prepared to take account of what will happen in the future. We do not believe we should tie down what will happen in the future. I do not support the case being made that we should say in 2005, when there may be 27 members, or in 2010 that we should do X, Y or Z. If it is all to be set down in stone at this stage, we might as well say what we are going to do now. The argument does not hold up. The bigger countries argue that much of the detail of this should be written down at this stage, to try to pre-determine the development and workings of the Union at either of the dates the Deputy mentioned. I do not agree with any of those arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand correctly that the Taoiseach is prepared to argue for some kind of dynamic clause being written into the treaty conclusions, calling upon member states to explore ways in which the provisions of the charter of fundamental rights could be enacted in domestic legislation? I see the Taoiseach nodding, which, in the interests of brevity, means he agrees to that, unless I have misunderstood him.</P>
      <P>I also want to impress on the Taoiseach that the right of Ireland to nominate a Commissioner after 2010 could be construed as a right to nominate a Commissioner to a rotating post. It does not necessarily mean we would have an exclusive right to a Commissioner beyond 2010, when the size of the Commission will be larger because the Union will be larger. Is it the clear position of the Government that it will not be satisfied with anything coming out of Nice that could be construed as meaning that after 2010 Ireland could potentially lose the right to have an Irish nominated Commissioner in the Commission at all times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the basis of our argument. The larger countries have not yet, ten days before the Nice meeting, accepted the right of any member state to keep a Commissioner. They have not moved, despite people saying at Biarritz that they would do that. The big five are still <Col N="1290" /> holding out on that. It is argued by many that they will move from that position to try to stipulate in very clear terms what will happen down the road, as we move from 15 to up to 27 member states. As Deputy Quinn and I have said, we will continue to say we should have representation. While the Commissioner does not represent the country, which nobody ever argues, it is an important part of the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people say we are trying to change the ground rules. They then argue they are prepared to give up their Commissioner, in strict alphabetical rotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And so relegate the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely. That is what I have said. We are now heading to Nice, where institutional discussions on the future will take place. I do not see the benefit in five or ten years &ndash; or next week &ndash; in not having the French, Germans, British, Italians or Spanish represented in the Commission for those discussions. I do not see how that would ever work &ndash; and this is where we must be careful in the future &ndash; unless there was a smaller, more executive type of Commission with strict rotation, qualified majority voting and reweighting the order of the day.</P>
      <P>That is why I and others have argued strongly that the internal dynamics should be towards strengthening the Commission, to give more powers to the President of the Commission, to allow the President to hire and fire, to allow the Commission have more vice-presidents and to allow them have a stronger role. That does not find much favour with the larger member states, not even the debate on it. The reason will only be apparent from a consideration of the likely circumstances in five to ten years. Along with four or five other small member states we have been very active in asking what is the agenda. An answer is never provided, which is unhelpful. For that reason I would be reluctant to tie anyone to rules dealing with future developments.</P>
      <P>I understand the difficulties and dynamics that will ensue when there are 27 member states around the table. The implications of attempting to move to that position must be spelt out. At that stage a case could be argued. When it is suggested that a solution would mean the non-attendance of Germany or France at the table the agenda can be fairly pre-supposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that there is a likelihood that at the 12th hour the Government will move away from its position of blanket opposition to any introduction of qualified majority voting with regard to taxation, especially with regard to, for example, regulations on VAT governing a company that might operate on both sides of the Border and that qualified majority <Col N="1291" /> voting may apply to that kind of issue? Is it the case that the Government rejects that on the basis that everything decided on taxation must be unanimous? </P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that the proposed EU constitution will become a basis for litigation in our courts against the Union and against member states? Does he not see the risk here, where the work of the Union would be delayed by it becoming a lawyer's playground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unwise not to. It is highly unlikely that such an issue will arise because it has been debated at length. The new area for debate is fraud, under which everything is considered. I will not fall into that trap either. I see no reason we should move away from our stated position. It is for domestic administrations to order their tax affairs on their merits. Given that issues in the tax code are interlinked, no arguments, cases or grounds for change have been put to me with which I would agree.</P>
      <P>I see the danger of the proposed EU constitution becoming a lawyer's playground. That is why the fundamental charter cannot be adopted and implemented. It must be considered against existing constitutional and legal checks. It was drafted as a political document. The argument made by us and many others is that it must be examined to ensure it is constitutionally correct. When that happens it should be in line with rulings of the European Courts. It would be incorrect to proceed otherwise and it is now accepted that this must be done. There is nothing to fear from a document becoming legally usable that incorporates all current individual rights, including those that may be extended in the future.</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the second question. A number of questions on the Middle East have been tabled to the Minister for Foreign Affairs today. We have taken every opportunity in recent months to support the difficulties with which President Arafat has had to contend.

I want to focus on the reweighting of the votes in the Council. Does the Taoiseach accept that any fundamental amendment to this balance is clearly designed to permanently shift the balance in favour of the large member states and prevent the small member states from holding the balance of power which they currently have? Does he accept <Col N="1293" /> that what is at stake in relation to reweighting is Ireland's ability to combine with other states to veto legislation where necessary? Does he also accept that if we agree to reweighting on the Council, which makes the decisions in the European Union, it will be next to impossible for small member states, like ourselves, to hold the balance of power as we have in the past? </P>

    <P>Deputy Sargent inquired if Article 57 is weak. He should remember that these articles take from <Col N="1294" /> what is already in existence; they are a reflection of the rights on offer through the various mechanisms. At this stage, there is no attempt to rewrite anything. However, that might change in the future. By and large, the assembling of the Charter of Fundamental Rights will involve taking on board that which already exists &ndash; I am not quite sure of the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>the article to which the Deputy referred &ndash; and using that as a basis to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage if it is a political document, the European Council will be responsible. If, in time, the other rights develop, it will be the European Court of Justice. This relates to the argument we discussed earlier, namely, whether it becomes a legal base. Many of the groups, particularly the trade union groups, argue that the new court should have the same powers as the European Court of Human Rights so that if a person was fighting for a right it would be extended under the mechanisms on offer through the latter institution. However, that is not the position at present. It is a political document which involved the assembling of what was already in existence. I will consider the article to which the Deputy referred to see if it was taken directly from what already exists.</P>
      <P>There is no change in the position of Mr. Solana, nor has his role been enhanced. The Western European Union will continue to have a role in respect of Article 5 or mutual defence issues, which are not going to be included under the institutional framework. Article 5 issues will remain in its institutional shell which will remain outside of the changes on CFSP.</P>

      <Quest>the toll of dead and injured to date in the current Middle East crisis; his views on whether these figures indicate an unwillingness or an inability on the part of the Israeli Government to use civilian policing methods rather than lethal military force in dealing with Palestinian protests; and the reason the commission of inquiry agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh is not yet actively engaged with the problem.</Quest>
      <QRef>[27464/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned about the crisis in the Middle East which has claimed more than 260 lives and left more than 10,000 people wounded. The scale of the violence is horrific. The past fortnight witnessed an attack by Israeli naval ships and helicopter gunships on 13 buildings in Gaza city and the sustained bombardment of the villages of Beit Sohour and Beit Jala, near <Col N="1295" /> Bethlehem, and horrific bomb attacks on the Israeli town of Hadera and on an Israeli school bus in Gaza.</P>
      <P>This appalling violence has put in jeopardy the Middle East peace process in which so many hopes have been placed. The spiral of violence risks triggering further escalation of the crisis. The Government has made clear its position. We deplore all acts of violence and call again on both sides to exercise the utmost restraint and to do all in their power to avoid further escalation. In particular, we have called on Israel to end the use of lethal force in dealing with protests where civilian policing methods would be more appropriate, and to end the economic blockade of Palestinian communities which is causing acute hardship.</P>
      <P>We strongly support the Sharm-el-Sheikh agreement and all efforts to restore calm and to find a peaceful solution. The first priority, as agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh, must be to end the violence. The objective will be to resume the peace negotiations leading to the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace, which must necessarily recognise both the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and Israel's right to live in peace and security.</P>
      <P>Our position has been conveyed to both the Israelis and Palestinians. I had discussions last month with the Palestinian Minister for International Co-operation, Dr. Nabil Sha'ath, and subsequently with Minister Rabbi Michael Melchior, a special emissary of Prime Minister Barak. I stressed the need for maximum restraint and encouraged Israelis and Palestinians to work together in rebuilding trust. I also took the opportunity at the Euro-Mediterranean Foreign Ministers' Conference in Marseilles to express the Government's concerns, in conversations with both the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Shlomo Ben-Ami, and with Dr. Sha'ath.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the European Union's continuing efforts to defuse the crisis and to encourage Israeli and Palestinian leaders to come together and work for a ceasefire.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>The General Affairs Council in Brussels last week called on both sides to fully implement the points agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh and in subsequent meetings. In particular, the council called on Israel to withdraw its forces from Palestinian territories to the positions they occupied before the crisis and to end the use of lethal force. We also called for an end to the economic sanctions and the restriction of movement in the Palestinian territories. At the same time, we called on the Palestinian Authority to do all in its power to end the violence. We made clear our willingness to assist in efforts to end the current violence and facilitate a return to the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support the commission of inquiry agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh. The commission met over the last two days to adopt its terms of reference <Col N="1296" /> and operation. The commission should now begin its work at the earliest possible date. This will be an important measure to help rebuild the confidence and trust which are essential to the success of every peace process.</P>
    <P>We are closely following developments in the Security Council in addition to our contact with the parties concerned and would hope that progress will have been made by the time we take our seat on the Security Council in January. As a member of the council, we will be considering the situation both in the light of developments and in line with Government policy.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that Palestinians represent 95% of the appalling toll of 260 dead and 10,000 wounded and that this speaks for itself <i>vis-à-vis </i>the use of lethal military force in the face of Palestinian protests? Does he also accept that there is now a need for the European Union to play a more forceful role in trying to assist in the discovery of a solution? Does he agree with the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, that there is scope for the establishment of an international force or monitoring body which could provide independent evidence on who is responsible for particular actions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the lethal force displayed by the Israelis since this latest set of problems arose has been totally disproportionate to the level of those problems. We put our view on this matter across in a very strong fashion, even before the most recent common EU position on it had been agreed.</P>
      <P>We want the European Union to play a greater and more effective role. However, I accept that it is already playing a strong humanitarian and economic role. The question of how effective it can be in the context of the peace process negotiations is reliant on the agreement of both sides. We have no problem with playing an expanded role and stand ready to do so once agreement has been reached. In the meantime, we also support the United Nations efforts and those of the Secretary General to examine with the parties arrangements for an observer mission in accordance with the Security Council's mandate. We continue to support the endeavours and personal commitment the Secretary General has shown in that regard.</P>
      <P>Mr. Solana is a member of the fact finding committee which began its work in recent days. We look for it to come forward, as expeditiously as possible, with an independent and credible assessment of what took place. We are also in agreement with the position of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, in respect of her assessment of the fact that there is a major ongoing problem in the Palestinian Authority area and that there is a need for the Israelis to withdraw, as set out in the Sharm-el-Sheikh agreement, to the positions they previously occupied.</P>

      <P>We support the United Nations Secretary General and the Security Council mandate that arises from recent discussions of this matter at Security Council level. That is the operation. Clearly, the monitoring about which the commissioner, Mary Robinson, spoke is in respect of the prospect of having independent observers placed in the Palestinian Authority area, which we would support. We need to get agreement between the parties on that issue, which has always been the problem. The UN Secretary General is working tirelessly to get agreement from the Israeli side to ensure this international role can be properly observed and validated. We support that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a short statement on the outcome of the recent Capabilities Commitment Conference and, in doing so, to address the particular issue raised in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>I attended, with the Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, the Capabilities Commitment Conference held in Brussels last week. The conference provided the opportunity for EU countries, including Ireland, to indicate formally the resources they can make available for potential humanitarian or crisis management operations. These contributions were made in the context of the voluntary Headline Goal agreed at the European Council at Helsinki last year.</P>
      <P>In summary, Ireland's contribution of up to 850 members of our Defence Forces does not in any way affect our long-standing policy of military neutrality to which the Government remains firmly committed, nor is any mutual defence arrangement involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A declaration by EU member states was issued <Col N="1298" /> after the conference which outlined progress to date on the elaboration of the voluntary goal in the lead-up to the Nice European Council. It clearly stated that the Union's contribution to international security would be made in keeping with UN and OSCE principles. Moreover, it reiterated that these steps did not imply the creation of a European army.</P>
    <P>Participation by Ireland in any Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision to be taken by the Government. The Government will decide on a case by case basis whether, when and how to commit either troops or other resources. In our interventions at the conference, Ireland reiterated these points and specified that in our case, in compliance with the terms of the relevant Irish legislation, we would participate only in missions authorised by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The capabilities announced at the conference constitute one element in the development of a European security and defence policy, which has its basis in the aims of the Amsterdam Treaty. They derive from decisions taken by European heads of state and government at successive European Council meetings in Cologne, Helsinki and Feira and are firmly rooted in the framework of European common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Particular concerns have been expressed concerning implications for our continued involvement in UN peacekeeping and, as raised by Deputy Higgins, regarding the possible role of certain NATO personnel.</P>
    <P>In addition to being entirely consistent with our policy of military neutrality, our commitment to the EU Headline Goal is fully in keeping with Ireland's approach to overseas peacekeeping and with our foreign policy traditions. We remain absolutely committed to Irish involvement in UN peacekeeping. We will continue to play a full part in it.</P>
    <P>In this context, I stress that the central role of the UN, and particularly that of the UN Security Council in matters of peace and security, is explicitly recognised by the EU. There are clear links between what the EU is trying to achieve and the overhaul of UN peacekeeping operations which is now under way in line with recently adopted Security Council Resolution No. 1327. Our membership of the UN Security Council will facilitate our efforts to help ensure that European security and defence policy and UN reforms proceed in a complementary and mutually reinforcing manner.</P>
    <P>The involvement of NATO stems from the fact that the EU, which is not a military organisation, is likely to remain dependent on NATO infrastructural and transport capacity, as UN-mandated operations such as SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina and KFOR in Kosovo have shown.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions have been taking place between the EU and NATO on the modalities for the use of NATO assets by the EU in carrying out specific Petersberg Tasks where the EU does not itself have adequate capabilities. In this context, it is envisaged that the Deputy Supreme <Col N="1299" /> Allied Commander of NATO, DSACEUR, would have a co-ordinating role between the EU and NATO on the allocation of NATO resources for a specific operation. The command arrangements for an EU-led operation would be for the EU to decide and the EU would maintain the political control of any operation using NATO assets and capabilities. Moreover, I emphasise that Irish involvement in operations where the EU and NATO co-operate will occur only where our peacekeepers act under a UN mandate.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that Ireland's ongoing participation in the development of European security and defence policy is fully consistent with our policy of neutrality and our commitment to international peace and security. We therefore, approach this task in a positive and constructive spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In a positive and constructive spirit and in response to the Minister's reply, I will ask him a number of questions. I am always grateful for his long replies because they are full of information. My first question, which was answered, was whether the new force will be under the logistical control of the Deputy Head of NATO who currently happens to be a British general, according to my information, and we can confirm that. Is it true that a joint meeting of EU Foreign Ministers and NATO ministers is being planned for December? If it takes place does the Minister propose to attend, and if he does, on what basis? As his commitment last Monday did not have the benefit of a public debate or an elaborate debate in this House, does the Minister agree the framework to which he referred in his reply within which these decisions are being taken has not been the subject of public debate or a debate in this House? The other point which he suggests as the source of the Irish position and the principle upon which he made the commitment last Monday is an evolving set of co-operations through Council over a period of years. Does the Minister agree that in view of the complexity of the matter and given that the force will be under the control of the Deputy Head of NATO, a public and extended debate in this House is necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case, as was suggested in the <i>Financial Times</i> last week. It is misleading to say that the Deputy Commander of NATO will be in control of any future EU force. That is not correct. What is correct is that in building a capability which will involve co-operation between EU and NATO in respect of NATO assets used in any EU rapid reaction force, there will be a co-ordinating role by the Deputy Commander of NATO. This is not to say he will be automatically in charge of any force which would engage in either military or civilian crisis management in the future. It is misleading to suggest the Deputy Commander of NATO will be in logistical control. That is not correct. The <Col N="1300" /> Deputy suggested there had not been a debate on the basis of the framework on which these developments have been taking place. That is also not correct. The legal basis for these developments is the Amsterdam Treaty which has been not only debated in this House but a referendum on the matter was put to the people. The legal basis of these developments has not changed. The capabilities conference is not a pledging conference. There is no binding obligation involved in Ireland participating in the conference. We are simply formally indicating what resources and personnel we would make available so that people involved in the planning of these operations in the future, should they arise, will know what capabilities are available within the EU member states.</P>
      <P>I therefore do not accept Deputy Higgins's suggestion that we do not know the framework. The legal basis has not changed and it is not true to suggest, as has been suggested in the public domain, that the Deputy NATO Commander would be in charge. It is in the context of EU-NATO co-operation which we have seen already in EU-mandated missions in Kosovo and Bosnia that that sort of involvement by NATO will take place and regardless of who is in charge of an operation in the future, it will remain under the political control of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises the question of who is in control. It is unusual to suggest that the person in charge of political control is in charge of the logistics. Surely the information, as is available for anybody who wants to look for it, is that what is very likely is that, following the co-operation in terms of military assets and capability, is logistical control. The other question I put to the Minister, which I am afraid he did not answer &ndash; which I accept was an omission &ndash; was whether, in the event of him being invited to a joint meeting of Foreign Ministers and NATO ministers for the purpose of co-operation into the future, he would attend and if he does, will he inform the House on what basis he will do so? Will he also make available the text that suggests that any Irish participation would be dependent on a UN mandate? Where is that text? Can it be placed in the Oireachtas Library?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, those in technical control will obviously be the European Union. The operations, should they be in military crisis management, will obviously involve military people. It is not correct to assume that it will be the Deputy Commander of NATO. What we can assume is that the co-ordinating role for the use of NATO assets in any EU-logged operation will be that of the Deputy Commander of NATO, which is only part of the total preparatory steps to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, in relation to the meeting, I have not yet been invited to such an event. If I am invited, I will positively consider it. The basis on which my attendance would take place would be that it is in relation of the co-operation that would be <Col N="1301" /> involved between the European Union and NATO in implementing the Petersberg Tasks under the Amsterdam Treaty to which we have signed up and with which I have no problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of UN mandates etc., the defence Acts stipulate legislatively that in excess of 12 military personnel requires the Government, having made the decision to participate, to come here and get the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the view of the Deputy that the existence of huge amounts of unspent funds in the EU aid programme must be urgently addressed. Ireland has been very critical of the failures of the EU development aid programme and, along with a number of like-minded states we have been pressing the European Commission for concrete action to make the programme more effective. I again raised this matter with Poul Nielson, the Commissioner with responsibility for Development and Humanitarian Assistance, when he visited Dublin last week.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of welcome developments recently in relation to the reform of the EU aid programme. One of the key weaknesses in EU policy identified by a series of independent evaluations was the lack of a clear statement of EU development policy which would give direction to the assistance programme. I welcome, therefore, the adoption by the Council of Development Ministers on 10 November of the first ever overall statement of EU development policy. The statement brings EU policy into line with the international objective of poverty eradication. It is also based on the very important principle of the ownership by our development country partners of their development processes.</P>

    <P>The statement is the first pillar in the reform of the EU aid programme. Implementation will be the second pillar. The Commission is implementing a programme which addresses the urgently needed reform of EC development assistance. Reforms under way include: the setting up of EuropeAid, the new office for Community aid, which will manage all Community aid programmes; the devolution of decision making to Commission offices in the field; a revision of <Col N="1302" /> the financial regulation which governs the Commission's management of the budget. The reform suggested would give the Commission greater flexibility in dealing with funds which have not been disbursed within a specified timeframe.EuropeAid will be set up by 29 November. The process of devolving decision making power from Brussels to EC delegations in the field will commence immediately, to 37 missions in 2001 and to all missions by 2003. There will also be 40 additional finance officers sent to 22 delegations to improve the management of assistance programmes.</P>

      <i>
      </i>Work on the backlog of aid has begun. Additional staff have been assigned to the clearing of older commitments. Forty-three per cent of pre-1995 commitments have now been cleared, and the global backlog of older commitments has been reduced by 25%. All dormant (i.e. pre-1995) commitments will be cleared by 2001.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Nielson is driving the reform effort with great determination. The necessary framework to improve the effectiveness of EU development assistance is in place and good progress is being made. While much work remains to be done, we will continue to press the Commission to implement these reforms quickly to ensure that EU aid is delivered to the poorest people in the developing world as rapidly and effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister shares my concerns. Does she not accept that it is one of the greatest scandals of our time that 20,000 million, which is about £16,000 million, is left unspent while half the world starves? Is this not the greatest indictment of all of the European Union? I say that as a supporter of the European Union. Is it not the worst aspect possible of the European Union? Will the Minister accept that at this stage everybody involved must take responsibility? Why has this gone on for ten years? Why is it only now that action is being taken? I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do now, but what has happened over the past ten years to allow this enormous treasure chest to accumulate while people are starving throughout the Third World?</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that such a level of unspent balance was allowed to accumulate over many years. Work has started on the backlog and additional staff have been assigned to clearing older commitments. A total of 43% of the pre-1995 commitments have now been cleared, and the global backlog of older commitments has been reduced by 25%. All dormant, i.e. pre-1995 commitments, will be cleared by 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the current Commissioner is a former Development Minister who is very committed to and has spearheaded the reform process. These unspent balances came <Col N="1303" /> to light only after a series of independent evaluations in 1998. They came up for discussion by Development Ministers in 1999, and all the member states were truly horrified at the scale of unspent balances that had been allowed to accumulate.</P>
    <P>To clarify one financial aspect of the issue, the huge sum of unspent EU aid is not sitting in a bank account waiting to be spent. About 10 billion of unspent moneys relate to commitments made under the EDF which are intended to assist the Afro-Caribbean and Pacific states. These funds have simply never been called up from the member states by the Commission. In other words, they have been allocated by member states but not called up for use by the Commission. That sort of inefficiency and bureaucracy is due to a number of reasons, many of which are a cause of legitimate concern to parliaments. These are the complex and time consuming bureaucracy in the Commission, leading to very slow decision making and delays in the approval of funding, a lack of decentralisation in the Commission, leaving too little decision making authority with the local Commission offices, and a rigidity in the funding system which makes it impossible to transfer funds from one allocation to another project. In some cases delays were legitimately caused by a freeze in long-term development aid to countries which were considered to be in breach of their commitments under the Lomé Convention. For example, during the 1990s long-term assistance but not humanitarian aid was suspended, <i>inter alia</i>, to Nigeria, the Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Togo, Niger and other countries, because of conflict. Another reason is the lack of absorption capacity in the developing countries. In other words, the countries did not have the capacity to make use of the allocation which had been given to them.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that it is irrelevant whether the money is kept in the treasuries of the European Union or of the member states? The money is unspent and, as a consequence, there is a continuation of appalling malnutrition, poverty, hunger, desolation and starvation throughout the world. Is it not a total indictment of all those involved that it was not even discovered until 1998 that this treasure chest lay there unspent? Would the Minister not accept that in relation to this disgraceful, bureaucratic foul-up, the people who are responsible should be held to be responsible and, now that there is a Commissioner with sole responsibility, he should be given a limited timeframe of between three and six months to clean up the mess or resign?</P>

      <P>The persons who could be deemed to have been accountable at the time have since left the Commission as Commissioners. The current Commissioner is very <Col N="1304" /> engaged with this reform programme. A start has already been made in allocating the unspent balances, and he hopes that all unspent balances will be cleared by 2002.</P>
      <P>I remain concerned about the financial management of the EU programme. Sweden will be taking over the Presidency of the European Union shortly. I have discussed this issue with the Swedish Development Minister, who is one among other like-minded Ministers who see it as one of the big challenges facing the European Union to clear up these unacceptable and insupportable bureaucratic reasons for delay. As the Deputy indicated, this bureaucracy is insupportable in the face of the need in developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>At last month's informal meeting of the European Council in Biarritz, the Heads of State and Government reviewed developments in the intergovernmental conference, and restated their determination to reach agreement at the Nice European Council, which will take place from 7 to 9 December. Intensive discussions have taken place at ministerial and official level in recent weeks, and over the coming weekend I will participate in the final Ministerial Conclave and General Affairs Council discussion prior to the Nice European Council.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the major areas under discussion are the composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council, the extension of qualified majority voting, and revised arrangements in the area of closer co-operation. While considerable progress has been made in relation to QMV and closer co-operation, there are, as might be expected, significant differences with regard to the Commission and reweighting which can only be resolved at Nice itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> With regard to the Commission, we, with other small and medium sized states, continue to maintain our position of one commissioner per member state while the larger states generally support imposing a ceiling on the size of the Commission. We have argued that the democratic legitimacy of the Union is greatly strengthened by one commissioner per member state and that it is particularly important that the newly admitted member states should, from the outset, have the opportunity, through participation in the Commission, to gain experience of all aspects of the Union's work. We continue to support proposals for strengthening the role of the President of the Commission, to ensure the post operates as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>The discussions on the reweighting of votes in the Council are also proving difficult. While indicating a preference for the dual majority model, we have stated our willingness to consider a range of options, provided they do not unduly distort existing balances. In this regard, we are prepared to give effect to the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty which provides that additional weighting may be given to those member states which forego the right to nominate a second commissioner.</P>
    <P>Concerning QMV, we have indicated that we are prepared to move to majority voting on a substantial number of articles while retaining unanimity for sensitive areas such as taxation. Other issues which remain under discussion, but where we have taken a generally positive position, subject to agreement on final texts, include the common commercial policy, justice and home affairs, human rights monitoring and arrangements in respect of migrant workers.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in revising the procedures in place with regard to closer co-operation. Discussions are continuing with respect to the second pillar, where we are concerned to ensure that we proceed in a manner which maintains the coherence of the Union's policies.</P>
    <P>We remain committed to securing a balanced outcome at Nice which will allow an enlarged Union to function effectively while maintaining essential institutional balances, including those between large and small member states. We believe that an agreement is attainable which will serve both our interests and those of an enlarged Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply although I am not at all clear on the possible shape of what will emerge from Nice. Perhaps the Minister is not clear on this either and must await the outcome of further negotiations. Does he accept that with all the emphasis, particularly from a PR point of view, on retaining a commissioner per member state which will happen in some shape or form, there is a great danger that we will find ourselves having a far more modest voice at the Council of Ministers? Does he further accept that the issue of the reweighting of <Col N="1306" /> votes is not being sufficiently emphasised and that there is a danger that Ireland's position and that of other small member states will be substantially modified? Is the Minister aware of this danger and does he realise that any change made in this regard would essentially be a permanent one which would considerably diminish our ability to secure a qualified majority or to be part of a blocking minority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of assumptions must be made if one puts the case the Deputy has advanced. If one actually analyses the pursuit of Irish interests at European level, the idea that there are ten small states which are united on all issues in opposition to five large states united on all issues does not reflect the reality of the position. In fact, it is difficult to find any issue on which the five large states are agreed. This reality has been lost in the negotiations because those states with two commissioners are pushing very hard for the reweighting of votes, be it the Italians who are seeking a substantial reweighting or other states which are adopting a more realistic approach. I do not believe that reweighting would result in the diminution of the Irish voice at the table, presuming we can arrive at a modest reweighting proposal which would meet with everyone's agreement.</P>
      <P>Our allies in many of these discussions are not limited to other small states and it is not true that all small states and all large states have the same interests. On a number of issues of fundamental importance, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, the position of large states is very much in line with ours. In the technicalities of the discussions, there is a failure to realise that this is not a case of ten small states <i>versus</i> five large states. As a result of the five large states having a more coherent voice in terms of their requirements in the event of losing a commissioner under the protocol, there is perhaps a feeling that the ten smaller states are not as coherent an opposition as they might be. One of the reasons for this is that in regard to pursuing essential policy interests at European level, not all of our interests are aligned with those of similarly sized states. We must superimpose a political judgment on the technicalities of the envisaged rearrangements for a more effective decision making body in an enlarged Union.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to assume that the one commissioner per member state has been conceded; it certainly has not. President Chirac's summation of the debate at Biarritz &ndash; which albeit an informal Council meeting was a good indicator of the level of outstanding differences &ndash; set out the position that there would be at least one commissioner per member state, the detail of which has yet to be finalised, or that states would retain their second commissioner, leaving open the possibility that agreement will not be achieved on this if a common position is not arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large states make the point that their voice has diminished in the enlarging Union and they <Col N="1307" /> want this issue to be addressed in the context of the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty, the interpretation of which is also a source of disagreement. It is not the case that the single commissioner per member state is a PR issue which has been conceded because this issue is totally inter-linked, as far as the five large states are concerned, with whatever reweighting proposals emerge. The idea that all of our interests are aligned with the other nine small states against the big five is not the political reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the Minister's efforts and want Ireland to obtain the best possible deal. I accept that the single commissioner per member state has not been conceded but I believe there will not be any agreement whatsoever unless that happens. I am concerned that there might be some ambiguous time scale attaching to the proposals to the effect that there will not be any assurance in regard to a single commissioner per member state after 2010. Decision making power ultimately lies at Council level and if we were to opt for the reweighting of votes, we would effectively suffer a permanent diminution of our strength. I am concerned that sufficient emphasis has not been placed on this matter.</P>
      <P>When Nice concludes the question of a referendum will remain to be addressed. Article 29 of the Constitution allows us to take any measures necessitated by our membership of the EU. If changes are made in regard to reweighting or an increase in qualified majority voting, does the Minister believe it will be necessary to hold a referendum? If a referendum will be required, the Government should surely be doing more to publicise the issues involved in order that the public, which will ultimately vote on them, would be aware of their content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of whether to hold a referendum will be made following receipt of the Attorney General's considered legal opinion when the treaty text becomes available. We have only seen drafts of the text in recent weeks. The major difference between these negotiations and the Amsterdam negotiations is that draft treaty texts of the latter were available six months prior to decisions being made. This is a prediction game but when we see what emerges from Nice, subject to attaining agreement there and obtaining considered legal opinion on the treaty texts, the Government will decide whether a referendum will be required. My position is that we should seek the best possible deal for Ireland and if that requires holding a referendum, we will have one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point that a referendum in the context of this ICG will be very different from previous referendums in that financial arrangements or transfer of competencies are not envisaged. We are talking about how to get a more effective decision <Col N="1308" /> making process in the Commission and in the Council in terms of voting procedures, including deciding the areas which will require unanimity and qualified majority voting. It is linked with the logistics of how the EU will move forward in terms of an historic enlargement phase and how it can continue to operate effectively. I therefore suggest that Government and those who support the process will have to indicate to the electorate the importance of supporting these changes should a referendum be required on the basis that the process of EU integration is in Ireland's interests and that it is important for the second most open economy in the world which lives by its exports to build a Single Market of 500 million people. We will propose that people vote, for what appears a pretty dry text, on general economic and social grounds, in the absence of being able to show a financial improvement in the Irish position, as was evident from the Edinburgh Summit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out, as Chris Patten has done today in <i>The Belfast Telegraph</i>, that policing issues are not restricted to legislation. I have <Col N="1309" /> acknowledged that there have been improvements in the course of the adversarial legislative process in certain key and significant areas from the time the Bill was first published when certain deficiencies were identified by the Government and other parties. Clearly, we are seeking to work constructively with all parties and the British Government to ensure that in the context of the implementation plan and other outstanding issues we can provide some certainty and clarity which will enable people to reflect and carefully study the full package. As Chris Patten pointed out, the legislative basis for police reform is just one leg of that changed scenario envisaged in the report. We are continuing to work intensively to bring about an accountable, effective, impartial, efficient and representative police force so people from the Nationalist community, who for historical and political reasons in the past have not been participating to the extent one would like, might participate in future.

      <P>I have noted the report of the views of UNHCR's senior liaison officer in Dublin. I was gratified to note in the report that she was impressed with the living standards of asylum <Col N="1310" /> seekers, as well as with the attitude of support groups and Government officials.</P>
      <P>The Government decision of 3 November 1998 approved the admission into Ireland of up to ten persons annually, above the number admitted as refugees under the convention and other programme refugees. These would be categorised as vulnerable persons by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. In addition, dependant family members of the ten persons could be admitted on a similar basis. As these persons are granted refugee status, the Refugee Agency has responsibility for co-ordinating arrangements for their admission, reception and resettlement.</P>
      <P>By the end of 2000, a total of 40 persons will have arrived in Ireland for resettlement under this programme. There are no immediate plans to increase Ireland's annual quota as the programme is relatively new. However, the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is happy with the report of the liaison officer of the UNHCR. However, the liaison officer made a few other points which I would like to raise. In an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> the officer drew attention to the fact that we took ten persons while Denmark took 500 and Sweden took 1,000. Does that comparison reflect somewhat on our capacity and willingness to receive people?</P>
      <P>I understand the liaison officer suggested that where people had to wait between four months and two years for a decision on their application it would be appropriate to allow them take a job. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate her attitude to this.</P>
      <P>The Minister might also comment on the suggestion by the liaison officer of the UNHCR that there was room for improvement in communications &ndash; the officer said it was an area &ldquo;which could do with some attention&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister propose making a special contribution to the shortfall of £156 million in the UNHCR's budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a difference in terms of this category of vulnerable refugees which we have agreed with UNHCR to accept. This category is in addition to programme refugees. For example, we responded very satisfactorily to the Kosovar programme. More than 1,031 Kosovars came to Ireland. Many have since returned while others have remained here and are very happy. This special category of vulnerable persons can grow in accordance with our capacity to deal with them. I stress that the needs of these people are intensive and comprehensive and the range of services they need is considerable. The Refugee Agency, which currently operates under the aegis of my Department, is under severe stress in trying to deal with the Kosovar refugees who are still with us and who need care, and the needs of asylum seekers, with between 700 and 1,000 asylum seekers coming to Ireland every month. They <Col N="1311" /> have needs to which the refugee services are trying to respond.</P>
      <P>The Government must judge its capacity to respond to the needs of these people in a reasonable and sensible way and that is the reason for the small number in that special category.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the liaison officer also gave us details about Zambia, one of the poorest countries in the world, that it receives more in a single day than we do in the entire year? On the question of the scandalous shortfall of funds of $150 million to the UNHCR's office, which has led to the withdrawal of services by that United Nations agency, is the Government disposed to making a special contribution to enable that valuable work to continue, particularly the services in danger in Africa?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Deputy when he says the poorer developing countries, particularly in Africa, are the main recipients of refugees. They take far more people fleeing persecution and conflict in Africa. Their poor neighbours, such as Zambia, receive far more than the developed world. Developed countries should reflect on that when we are restrictive in our attitude to receiving refugees. The Deputy asked about the shortfall in the UNHCR budget. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UNHCR and it is other countries which need to look at their response to the UNHCR. In every communication we have with the UNHCR it is extremely grateful and expresses its appreciation of the solid support of Ireland. That goes particularly to its funding for emergency programmes in Africa, in particular, and also to its main central funding in New York and elsewhere. We gave special support to the UN High Commissioner Mary Robinson's office which was a unique contribution by Ireland.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 16 Council formations at present, some of which meet as often as 12 times per year. Ministers and Ministers of State attend the various Council meetings according to their areas of functional responsibility. Following each Council meeting, a comprehensive Council press release is issued which gives a list of those attending from each member state and full details of the agenda. These press releases are available in the public domain. Each <Col N="1312" /> one issued since 1 January 1995 can be accessed on the EUROPA website.</P>
      <P>Once every six months, the presidency in office invites the Ministers attending individual Council formations to an informal gathering. These meetings are known as Gymnich Meetings and take place in the country holding the presidency at the time. These serve the useful function of allowing EU Ministers to confer informally, often about longer-term and strategic issues, without the pressure of more immediate work which can often dominate Council agendas. There are no agendas for informal meetings. No formal business is transacted. No conclusions are adopted.</P>
      <P>I have attended informal meetings of Foreign Ministers on two occasions since taking up appointment. At the first such meeting, held at the Azores during Portugal's EU Presidency on 6-7 May 2000, Ministers discussed the future of Europe, the Western Balkans, expenditure on the EU's foreign policy priorities, European security and defence policy, Austria, the situation in Zimbabwe, the next EuroMed ministerial meeting, developments in Sierra Leone, EU-Turkey relations and Russia.</P>
      <P>At the most recent Gymnich Meeting, held at Evian Les Bains, France on 2-3 September 2000, Ministers discussed the future of Europe, the Middle East Peace Process, the EU's external relations and the Western Balkans.</P>
      <P>With regard to informal gatherings attended by other Ministers, invitations are normally issued directly by the chairman in office of each such Council formation to the relevant Irish Minister. By their nature, such meetings are conducted through informal procedures, without the direct involvement of my Department. Should the Deputy require information about the attendance of Ministers other than those for Foreign Affairs, he might direct his question to each of the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>The Minister should compliment the theological section of his Department for that reply. It did not answer my question. There are about 14 Council meetings which one of his colleagues in Cabinet could have attended since assuming office in June 1997. I shall try to be a little more banal in my language. Will he agree that it would be seriously damaging to the national interest if of those 14 meetings some of his colleagues were not able to attend, perhaps, two or three meetings, while important matters in the different areas were being discussed, particularly so far as the arrangements for such meetings had been facilitated by his Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Teaching is a noble and a very skilled <Col N="1314" /> profession. In Ireland we have been extraordinarily blessed with the quality and dedication of those to whom we entrust our children to be educated. A teacher's work is valuable, requiring qualifications, expertise, dedication and commitment. Teachers should be paid appropriately. As Minister for Education and Science I strongly support the case for a proper modern system of remuneration for all teachers. It saddens me, however, that ASTI members have decided to step outside the parameters laid down by the social partners, the country's trade unions, businesses, farming organisations and Government.</P>
      <P>The action of secondary teachers who are members of the ASTI has continued to directly impact on pupils. The one day strike on 14 November, followed by industrial action on 16, 22 and 23 November and again today, means that pupils have lost valuable school time. ASTI members will be aware that their actions have been felt most acutely by students in leaving and junior certificate examination classes.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the ASTI did not respond favourably to requests from the school management bodies to facilitate the teaching of leaving and junior certificate classes. Even more disappointing is the renewal of the threat to the examination process. The threat by the ASTI that it will attempt to disrupt the examination system is almost unthinkable. ASTI teachers, as professionals, know and understand the high level of anxiety already facing examination students and they must appreciate the additional stress placed on students by such threats.</P>
      <P>The ASTI is pressing a claim for a 30% increase. Teachers already received a 3% and 5.5% increase on 1 October. They will receive another 5.5% and 4% increase under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. That amounts to a cumulative 19.2% increase before any tax concessions, a minimum of 10% arising from the budget process. This amounts to a minimum of 29.2% extra in teachers' pockets under the PPF.</P>
      <P>There is a process for teachers to tackle their concerns. I am available at all times to facilitate that process but I cannot work outside the parameters decided by the country's social partners. The public service benchmarking body, which was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, met with both the public services section of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government Employers Committee. Following these meetings it is clear that the ASTI claim can best be progressed through the machinery of the benchmarking body, chaired by Mr. Justice Quirke of the High Court as an independent chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public service benchmarking body has been set up to undertake a fundamental examination of public service pay and jobs <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector. The benchmarking body in reaching its recommendations will have regard to the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff with the qualifications, skills and flexibility required to <Col N="1315" /> exercise their different responsibilities and the need to ensure equity between employees in the public service and the private sector. This benchmarking process provides a mechanism through which ASTI can pursue its aspirations for a fundamental examination of the role of second level teachers and the level of pay it should attract. This is the route being pursued by their colleagues in the other teacher unions and the public service unions generally.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I continue to be available at any time to meet with the president and officials of ASTI to find a way to ensure the education of second level pupils is not further disrupted and that the serious concerns of parents are put to rest as quickly as possible. I welcome the opportunity to outline in some detail the efforts made by me and my Department from the time the ASTI claim was first lodged last March. It will be clear that the claim was processed efficiently and professionally in accordance with the best industrial relations practice and in accordance with procedures agreed with the teacher unions.</P>
    <P>The ASTI claim is for an immediate 30% increase in salary allowances. The cost of the claim when applied to all teachers would be in excess of £400 million per annum. The ASTI was not satisfied with the offer to apply the terms of the PPF made in direct negotiations with my Department and referred the claim to the agreed teachers arbitration board. The three person independent arbitration board rejected their claim and recommended the pay terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness should be applied to ASTI members in common with other teachers and other public servants.</P>
    <P>I immediately applied the arbitration board's finding to ASTI members. As I have already said, the application of the pay terms of the PPF and the associated early settlers agreement to ASTI members means a cumulative pay increase of 19.2% within a two year period, beginning with an 8.5% increase effective from 1 October last. The PPF provides also for significant tax concessions in the region of 10% which, taken together with the pay increases, amount to 29.2%. In addition to these guaranteed improvements, teachers can also process their case for a further pay increase through the public service benchmarking body which is being established to undertake a fundamental examination of public service jobs <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector. That body held its first meeting with the public services committee of ICTU and the Government employers' representatives on Monday, 20 November.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated in the House, my Government colleagues and I are firmly of the view that the solution to the present dispute lies within the well established framework of social partnership and within the framework of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in particular. It is noteworthy that the arbitration board expressed the view that to deal with this claim on <Col N="1316" /> its own would bring about uncertainty in the area of public service pay and would no doubt generate a significant number of similar claims. I fully support that view. I am also convinced that the benchmarking process as set out in the PPF provides the best mechanism for a thorough and independent examination of the issues raised by the ASTI in its claim. Indeed I would point out that the majority of the public service unions, including two of the teacher unions, consider that the benchmarking body provides a means by which public service employees can achieve their goals of equal treatment with the private sector and people in comparable employment.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious to resolve the present difficulties with the ASTI. When I met the ASTI I indicated that I am available at all times to consider any proposals within the parameters of the agreed social partnership framework, the PPF. I now restate my availability and willingness to seek solutions within such a framework. This is the framework within which other public service unions are operating and which the other teacher unions are using to have their concerns, which are similar to those of the ASTI, addressed. I am absolutely committed to ensuring that normal education resumes for all students as soon as possible. As a parent, I understand fully the anxiety this disruption is causing to students and their parents. I will do everything possible in the context of a settlement to this dispute to ensure the loss to students, particularly examination students, is made good in the most beneficial and practical way. Once more I urge the ASTI to reconsider its action, the effects that action is having on our young people and to rejoin their colleagues in the other teacher unions and in the public service generally in the partnership process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the Minister's plámás to the teaching profession as being noble and skilful will wash in the context of his inactivity. The Minister is the political head of the Department and he now presides over an almighty shambles out of which there is no glory for anyone. In his lengthy reply he indicated on more than one occasion that this should only be settled within the terms of the PPF. He outlined his regard for students in particular.</P>
      <P>By this weekend in excess of 500,000 teaching hours will have been lost. In his anxiety to meet the ASTI and his holding out of an olive branch, what arrangements is the Minister putting in place for leaving and junior certificate students to be able to fulfil their educational responsibilities so that they can take their examinations, which is the legal responsibility of the State to conduct? </P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Second, does the Minister propose that these students should wander around aimlessly while their counterparts in private colleges <Col N="1317" /> receive a full education and how is his concern being manifested by way of ministerial action? </P>
      <P>Arising from his many references to the PPF, can the Minister tell the House how many groups are adhering to the PPF and what are those groups? Why are concessions being made to other groups, including the Garda, nurses, CIE and Aer Lingus employees, which are outside the terms of the PPF? Why can Deputy Molloy, meet the taxi drivers and the Deputy O'Rourke meet CIE employees? Why has the Minister drawn a line in the sand, over which teachers cannot step?</P>
      <P>We are within sight of Christmas and the Minister has done nothing to initiate meaningful discussions and end this dispute. Students, parents and teachers want to see schools resuming. The fact that the finding of the arbitration board was not accepted by the teachers does not preclude a return to arbitration. The arbitration body is chaired by a senior member of the Labour Relations Commission and all teaching unions are represented on it. In the light of new circumstances and evidence, a new finding may be given.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the real concern of teachers to get back to their profession? Is he aware that the matter could be referred to arbitration where the legitimate grievances of teachers could be discussed? </P>
      <P>Has the Minister an understanding of what happens in hundreds of classes throughout the country every week where many teachers, under pressure and stress, are barely able to conduct themselves with any degree of decorum? With regard to last Thursday's withdrawal of supervision, it has been brought to my attention that a number of schools conducted scheduled parent teacher meetings, which was the normal activity for that day. Does the Minister intend to pay teachers for conducting normal business in that manner?</P>

      <P>Deputy Kenny asked how many groups are part of the PPF and appeared to suggest that not many were. Most groups are in the PPF. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the other two teacher unions are parties to PPF and it is through the partnership that the matter can be resolved.  At the outset, it was suggested by the ASTI that the benchmarking process was not capable of resolving the problems teachers face, while I believed it was. The body has held its first meeting, having done much preliminary work, and has shown its willingness to deal with the issues raised by the ASTI. The other unions can see this is the case. The process is there and the negotiating table is available. If the ASTI members wish to go to the table, debate their position and find a resolution the table is available for them. If they believe I can be of any assistance in facilitating them in working with the rest of the public sector and the other unions, I will do all in my power to facilitate that. I am prepared to facilitate negotiations but I am not prepared to break the PPF. As a member of the Government, I am committed to it.</P>
      <P>The means of resolution is there, if the ASTI wishes to participate in the PPF and in the benchmarking body. The Deputy suggested that the ASTI might wish to go back to the arbitration board. I would have no objection to that if it is possible. The matter had already been to arbitration when an independent chairman decided the ASTI should operate within the PPF and that all the means necessary were available within the partnership, including the benchmarking body. We have been through the arbitration process but if it is possible to go through it again I will not object. My only interest is in ensuring a satisfactory resolution of the dispute and that the children go back to school.</P>

      <P>This is the second successive week that the Minister has been called into the House to answer questions on his role in resolving this dispute. His long-winded and rambling reply only tells us he has done nothing in the past week to <Col N="1319" /> move the dispute on. The situation is seriously deadlocked. Does the Minister accept that he has a political responsibility to the secondary school students who, by the end of this week, will have lost seven days in school? Does he accept that he has a political responsibility to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency?</P>
      <P>What mechanism does the Minister propose for the resolution of this dispute? Last week he gave us no indication of this. After questions last week, his staff indicated to the media a possibility of bringing forward the benchmarking process. Can the Minister tell the House what can be done to bring forward the benchmarking process?

Is it not the case that the Government is now reaping the <Col N="1320" /> reward for having taken advantage of the willingness of many teachers over many years to give an enormous amount of time and effort to their students, completely outside the call of duty, in the same way as this, and previous Governments, allowed low paid bus drivers to subsidise public transport in Dublin?

What does he say to the fact that the rest of the 19%, which he says teachers will get over three years, will probably also be wiped out by inflation?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that young teachers in their twenties and thirties should have the ability and the right to buy a home? Why should the Minister come in and condemn teachers because they want their wages to go up so they can buy a home when the same Minister's Government allowed the speculators in the housing market to put a home out of their reach in four short years? Does he not agree that his case is completely shot by virtue of the failure of this Government to sort out the problems that are making life increasingly difficult for working people, including teachers, who are trying to survive despite massive inflation, increasing house prices and so on?</P>

      <P>I would like to make it clear to Deputies that the benchmarking system covers 235,000 public servants. They are being provided for within the benchmarking system. Some 16,000 ASTI members have stepped outside that system. The system is very important to 235,000 public servants and I am not going to, nor can I, break that. The PPF is crucial for those very children who are in school and for the country as a whole, as I think everybody knows. It is what has made <Col N="1321" /> this country &ndash; partnership through successive Governments. I give credit to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton, the Taoiseach and Deputy Quinn for assisting and promoting that system through the years. That is what has built this country.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the fairness and objectivity of the leaving certificate is one of the great strengths of the Irish education system? Will he say what proportion of students likely to sit the leaving certificate this June are affected by the strike, that is, those in secondary schools, and what proportion are unaffected, that is, those studying in private colleges, community colleges or other unaffected colleges? Arising from his answers to those questions, what steps will he take to ensure fairness in the examination of students who have been strike-bound &ndash; locked out of their schools effectively &ndash; and students who have had the advantage of a continuing education in order to guarantee that this year our leaving certificate is seen to be fair to all students and is judged solely on things within their control and not events outside their control, as this strike is?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the ASTI has escalated its dispute to take in most of the community schools and any school in which there are ASTI members. Before this weekend, it was working on the basis that any school with fewer than ten ASTI members would be outside the net, if you like. Apparently, they are now being included so that extends it fairly generally. I appreciate the point made by Deputy Bruton and the earlier point made by Deputy Kenny on those private schools where managements have maintained the service to the young people. If this dispute can hopefully be resolved quickly, then I would be happy to do what I can to maintain that balance.</P>

Is it not the case that the Minister is ultimately the guarantor of fairness in education and that he has a responsibility to ensure fair treatment of all students? It is not fair that some will have to sit an exam having lost many school days and compete with young people who have had no loss of school days; that undermines the fairness of the <Col N="1322" /> leaving certificate. The Minister has to do something about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the fact there are disputes in progress concerning teachers, signalmen, rail gate minders, pilots, planning staff and a number of child care staff in residential homes and a number of other claims coming through the industrial relations machinery which could result in disputes, will the Taoiseach outline to the House the arrangements being made through the conciliation mechanisms of the PPF and in the preparation of the budget to ensure that a pay offer is made to all under the PPF to take account of the fact that inflation is currently running at twice the rate upon which the PPF was originally negotiated? </P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I in order in asking for time to debate the crisis in industrial relations generally? Will the Government consider providing the House with an opportunity for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has responsibility for the machinery of industrial relations, to address some of the concerns expressed by the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission yesterday who talked about the fact there are more than 350 disputes on his desk, that he expected to have 20 or 30 more yesterday morning and that he had recently lost three of his top staff? There is now a crisis in the machinery for which the Government is responsible in terms of dealing with these disputes and it should issue a comprehensive statement on what it proposes to do to deal with this crisis which appears to be completely out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of cases before the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission at present. It is not unusual for these bodies to deal, in one form or another, with several hundred cases but the pressure on them in the past two to three months is greater than has been the case for some time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Bruton, talks between the social partners, namely, the ICTU and IBEC, on the inflation rate package are ongoing. They are trying to discover if they can reach agreement on what is to be done, particularly given that inflation is now higher than it was when they signed on for the PPF.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both parties are endeavouring to find a way to reach agreement. Obviously, this matter does not merely involve a resolution of public service matters. Agreement must also be reached in respect of the private sector. I hope those discussions will conclude soon but I accept that they are not likely to conclude in the next few days. With regard to arranging a debate, that is a matter for the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government willing, in principle at least, to make special financial provision in the budget in respect of any cost which <Col N="1335" /><Col N="1336" /> might be incurred in 2001 to meet the terms of any agreement which might be reached in terms of re-negotiating elements of the PPF to take account of inflation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I must pursue one of the questions I posed earlier. There is an urgent need for the Tánaiste to come before the House to indicate if she will be able to fast-track the filling of the personnel vacancies to which I already referred. She is the person responsible for the maintenance of the State's industrial relations machinery. In addition, she should state whether extra staff resources will be allocated in order that the existing machinery can be utilised to full effect to deal with a matter which is now more problematical than it has been for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Bruton's question, until the discussions are completed I do not know whether it is possible to reach agreement on this issue. I do not want to pre-empt matters by referring to the allocation of resources, etc. However, I again emphasise that this matter is relevant to both the public and private sectors. Any agreement will have to be agreed by both sectors. If an agreement is reached, the Government will then be obliged to deal with the matter. However, no such agreement has yet been reached and the negotiations are ongoing.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Quinn's question, the resources are in place but the bodies in question have lost some members of staff. Perhaps the Deputy should table parliamentary questions to the Tánaiste to ask how she intends to fill those posts.</P>

Could the Taoiseach tell the House whether he now has taken upon himself to amend the law without amendments to legislation? Recently the law relating to the courts and court officers allowed for people to serve until the age of 70 but the Attorney General seems to be taking a hand in changing that law by refusing permission for people to serve until they are 70.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary estimate for the Environment and Local Government reaffirms this Government's commitment to providing the infrastructure appropriate to a modern economy so that economic progress can be maintained and built upon. We are delivering on the undertakings given in the national development plan and will continue to do so. Overall the Supplementary Estimate of £121 million represents an increase <Col N="1344" /> of about 7% on the net expenditure provision in my Department's revised estimate. It will fund the provision of an additional £80 million for the national roads network, £45 million for the water and waste water services programme and £30 million for the Exchequer contribution to this local Government fund. These are the principle spending increases for which the supplementary provides while the other items being catered for are mainly technical in nature. A new subhead is being opened to underpin a provision of £2.8 million for partnership and local authorities and a further subhead is being opened to defray expenditure of £800,000 on that national spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>These increases, which amount to more than £158 million, will be partly offset by savings of more than £37 million arising on the social housing and urban renewal programmes. This leaves a net requirement of £121 million for which I seek a Supplementary Estimate this year.</P>
    <P>The time available to me will not permit me to speak in detail on the different items for which I seek additional funding. There will be an opportunity for the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government to debate the individual items, and I look forward to discussing with the committee the progress being made on the infrastructural and other programmes concerned.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made on the national road network. The need to develop the network to the standard set out in the national development plan is universally accepted both by economic commentators and by those of us who use the network for business or domestic reasons. The national development plan will see more than £5 billion &ndash; measured in current prices &ndash; in the network. This will enable the rapid and sustained delivery of more than 600 kilometres of motorway or dual carriageway to be realised.</P>
    <P>The requirement for an additional £80 million this year, coming on top of an historically high allocation, means that we are on course to achieve this. The current year has seen significant progress on many major road schemes, including the M1 Dunleer-Dundalk, the N9 Moone-Timolin, the N4 Mullingar-McNeads Bridge and the N20 Croom by-pass, all of which are expected to open by the end of the year, six months ahead of schedule. The N7 Nenagh by-pass opened in July &ndash; almost 12 months ahead of schedule, and the N25 Kilmacthomas by-pass is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2001, six months ahead of schedule. Progress has also been made on the other major road schemes, such as the N11 Glen of the Downs, the M50 Southern Cross Route and the N20 Patrickswell/Limerick. Favourable weather conditions, allied to strengthening of on-site management practices by the larger construction firms, have had a significant impact on the progress of the major projects which are under way at present.</P>
    <P>Water and waste water services constitute another vital programme in our drive to secure <Col N="1345" /> the infrastructure we need to lay the foundation for continuing economic growth. The rationale of this programme goes beyond economic growth alone; it represents an important component of our efforts to ensure that economic growth is achieved in tandem with, and not at the expense of, the protection of our natural environment. A sum of £36 million of the additional amount sought will be used to finance additional output from the Exchequer element of the major schemes component of the programme. The balance of £9 million will be directed to the programme for upgrading rural water supplies.</P>
    <P>The other substantive amount being provided is the £30 million for the Exchequer contribution to the Local Government Fund, which will result in £315 million being available for this purpose in the current year. When the original provision of £285 million was settled in the context of this year's Estimates, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness had yet to be agreed, and a significant proportion of the additional amount sought will cater for increased costs for local authorities arising from the terms of this agreement.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>When I received this Supplementary Estimate last week I thought it would contain good news. I was shocked to find that under subhead B1 there is some £27 million unspent under the heading of social housing. I find it inexplicable in a week when we have revised statistics which show that there are 45,000 applicants for local authority housing, when the nearer one gets to Dublin, the greater the crisis. In Kildare the number of applicants has increased by 98%, in Meath by 140%, in Wicklow by 81%. Even if the Minister disputes the statistics, I cannot understand why, when it became known that the money would not be spent in Ballymun flats on a rehousing programme, the money could not have been diverted into turnkey operations, the purchase of houses, or grant-in-aid to voluntary housing organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can go through the Supplementary Estimate in forensic detail at the committee tomorrow, and I have many questions to raise. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the saving on this subhead does not remain at the end of this year. If we were to look at emergency provision, I am sure there is no Deputy in this House who has not met Focus Ireland and the Salvation Army in relation to the plight of the homeless in urban Ireland, people who are just looking for basic shelter at night. Spaces for hostel type equipment are simply not available. It is open to the Minister &ndash; I have done it as Minister &ndash; to give grants-in-aid to organisations providing that they spend it subsequently in a vouched for way. The average industrial wage is £16,000 and prevailing house prices in Dublin for the type of house that new home buyers are looking for is £200,000. That is a multiple of six, but lending agencies will lend a maximum of only three times the annual wage. <Col N="1346" /> That means there is a huge affordability gap, and people who never before considered looking for social affordable housing must go on these waiting lists. Hence their spiralling growth over recent months. Think of the misery of three generations, or three families under one roof, of people living in mobile homes, or in very insecure conditions in private rented accommodation for which rents are spiralling because, with the implementation of the third Bacon report, the supply of rented accommodation is drying up as we speak. Instead of 33,000 units a year being built to meet demand, building has come to a standstill, and this problem will get much worse.</P>
    <P>I am bitterly disappointed that, in the most socially critical area, the Minister has under-spent by £27 million. It is quite scandalous. I cannot understand why, when the Minister got a printout from the different assistant secretaries at the management committee meetings as to how spending was going at mid-year, he could not have given an instruction to divert money in this way. It is mismanagement of the Estimate. It is no use blaming local authorities for building only 900 of 4,500 houses. The money could have been diverted into turnkey operations whereby they could simply acquire an entire estate that is nearing completion or get a voluntary housing organisation to do it. I do not believe the money cannot be spent.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country deep resentment is building up over the 11 public private partnership projects. It is not clear what the buyback period to the public sector will be for these toll roads. There is a feeling that the selection of by-passes and bridges for hard tolls is arbitrary and will discriminate economically against certain regions. Is there protection built into these contracts that will stop excessive profiteering if the amount of traffic exceeds what is projected? All previous forecasts have underestimated the amount of traffic. Has the Minister looked at the possibility of either a green tax across the board or shadow tolling as in the UK? </P>
    <P>I look forward to dealing with this in a question and answer session tomorrow. It is a disgrace that given the housing crisis this Minister cannot spend the budget he has and is returning £27 million under social housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Yates in drawing attention to the fact that this Government has not managed to spend the money which was voted by this House for the provision of social housing in the current year, at a time when we have a housing crisis worse than we have ever had in the State. Focus Ireland has published two reports in the past two weeks. The first report on homelessness indicates that 1,200 children in Dublin are in bed and breakfast accommodation. The children must leave the bed and breakfasts in the morning and travel around the streets and parks of the city until 6 p.m. because they do not have any place to call home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second report published yesterday confirmed the suspicions of many that there has been a 17% <Col N="1347" /> increase in the number of people on local authority waiting lists. Some 45,000 families are seeking local authority accommodation and almost 60,000 families are on local authority waiting lists of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The problem of homelessness has reached crisis point. It is no exaggeration to state that some homeless people will not survive the winter. The findings of the report from Focus Ireland confirm much of what I and other Members are encountering in the course of our constituency work. I meet homeless elderly people and homeless children and their parents whose physical health is clearly deteriorating. I meet people whose situation is so desperate that they are bordering on being suicidal. The extent of homelessness in large urban areas is now a life and death issue. Instead of presenting a Supplementary Estimate in which he is saving money, the Minister should present a Supplementary Estimate which involves emergency measures being taken to deal with the problem of homelessness and lack of housing, backed up, if necessary, by emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>The strategy on homelessness, published earlier this year by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, which is supported by the Labour Party, will take time to implement but, meanwhile, people have no place they can call home. The resources of local authorities, the State and its agencies, must be mobilised immediately in order to identify emergency accommodation for homeless people. Day facilities must also be provided for families and children who are currently forced to walk the streets on a daily basis. These people do not have anywhere to make a cup of tea or play with their children. I met a mother yesterday who tried to explain to me what it is like to keep a child strapped into a buggy all day long because there is nowhere for the child to play and nowhere to take the child on leaving the bed and breakfast in the morning.</P>
    <P>This is the reality of homelessness in this prosperous economy. Yet, the Minister comes into the House this evening telling us that he was unable to spend the money allocated to his Department last year for the provision of housing. There is no point blaming the local authorities. It has been known for some time that local authorities have not produced their allocated housing output for a number of years. There is a variety of reasons for that, of which the Minister is well aware. These include the difficulty of obtaining land, staff shortages, the shortage of professional and project management skills in some local authorities&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Minster of State with responsibility for housing have been aware of these difficulties for some time, yet they have not taken any action to address them. It is <Col N="1348" /> the Minister's responsibility to ensure that housing provision is made, that money is spent and that the moneys allocated for social housing by this House are converted into housing for those who need it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate of £121 million which represents an increase in the region of 7% in the Department's expenditure. This Minister has been one of the most reforming Ministers with responsibility for the environment. I appreciate that there are huge numbers of people on housing waiting lists but this Minister has attempted to reform local government in the face of unnecessary blockages. The Minister has given the lead in regard to local government reform and we should follow his example. The Supplementary Estimate also involves a £23 million increase in funding to address homelessness.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of an additional £80 million for the national road network. Excellent work is being done on the national road network and the commitments outlined in the national development plan, which will see more than £5 billion, measured in current prices, being invested in the network, are being met. My constituency has benefited in this regard with the designation of the N9 which runs through Carlow and Kilkenny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle also welcomes the designation of the N9 although I respect his impartiality. The designation of the N9 includes vital work such as the construction of by-passes which have been sought for several years. Every constituency throughout the country will benefit from the funding provided under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The second river crossing in Waterford which will link up with the N9 is a very important development. Bellevue Port in south Kilkenny has great development potential. I am delighted that as recently as yesterday, the Minister included an allocation of £11 million to Kilkenny County Council, under the £45 million allocation for water and waste services, in regard to the south Kilkenny water supply scheme. The contract documents submitted by the council in regard to the drilling and testing of exploratory bore holes have been approved. This will result in great developments in the south-east region &ndash; south Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford, south Tipperary etc. In light of the announcement made by the Waterford Harbour Board during the week to the effect that it intends to extend Bellevue Port and to replace a recently damaged crane with a new one, the Minister's announcement was particularly timely. There is also a need for electricity supply to be provided in the south-east region and I hope the Minister's colleagues will take this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to provide additional <Col N="1349" /> funding for the five year county road programme. We must continue to provide funding for this measure, particularly as the recent bad weather has damaged some of the good work which has been carried out to date.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the foresight to increase the grants provided to group water schemes to more than £5,000. I urge him to extend this increase to the group sewerage schemes as there is a great demand for such schemes in smaller towns and villages. I am aware of the development of public private partnerships in this area but group schemes have done tremendous work over the years and the Minister should provide an incentive for them to provide necessary infrastructure. It is unfortunate that we do not have more time, but I welcome the Supplementary Estimate. It is a continuing part of the good work the Minister has been doing, and I commend him on it. I hope that by 2002 he will have made many more advances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy McCormack. Deputy Aylward mentioned upgrading the N9, and Deputy Yates said this would lead to the downgrading of the N11. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of joining the N11 and the N9. There is no major access from the south-east to the midlands, and perhaps in future a route from Arklow to Carlow could be examined.</P>
      <P>The IMF recently published a report which stated that with respect to house prices no industrial country in the past 20 years has experienced increases on the scale of Ireland without suffering a subsequent fall. It is estimated that since 1994 new house prices have increased by 118% and second hand houses by 156%. I am not necessarily saying the Government is to blame for this. Many people will dispute the various percentages, but the fact is that house prices have increased dramatically which has given rise to many people joining the public waiting lists who heretofore would not have been on them.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister has provided much funding under subhead B1 for housing, with an increase of £260 million, which is commendable. However, there is still a problem. Previous speakers have pointed out that £27 million was returned so we must realise there is something wrong with the structures. What is the point in giving money to local authorities if they cannot spend it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, last week told local authorities to crank up, but that is not satisfactory. Something must be done. The Minister is aware there has been a difficulty for the past few years. By my reckoning there are 90 independent statutory housing authorities, from Skibbereen to Leitrim and from Sligo to Enniscorthy, which is ridiculous. They are only building approximately 60% of their allocation. In 1999, with increased demand and funding, they only built 2,900 houses, the percentage dropping by half. There is something radically wrong and <Col N="1350" /> while I do not know how the Minister will solve it he should look at the concept of streamlining these authorities. Is there a case for a national housing authority? It is very difficult for a Minister with responsibility for housing to get anything done.</P>
    <P>In recent days the Minister is reported as talking about giving greater housing contracts and that it is hoped 25,000 houses will be built between now and 2003. However, I do not see how that can be done. Deputy Yates proposed that perhaps local authorities would buy out private housing estates, which could be a solution.</P>
    <P>We are very short of research in terms of a national housing authority. Statistics from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and the Goodbody report, show the various units available in December 1999 and December 2005. The Bacon report also refers to these statistics, but there is a contradiction in the figures, which must be examined. Local authorities have no information in terms of housing units, and it is important that such information is gathered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a simple request for the Minister. I ask him to show some real concern for the waste management efforts of local authorities. This week Galway city, for example, is starting a separation and recycling pilot scheme in 650 houses. While this entails much extra work for householders, they are enthusiastically taking part and we expect to have it city wide within a year. At last night's meeting of the corporation there was a proposal to increase refuse charges from £120 to £170, an increase of 41%. If that happens, it will simply kill the efforts of the corporation and the people of Galway in terms of recycling as they will say they are being charged £50 for their extra efforts.</P>
      <P>An increase of £50 will bring in an estimated additional £800,000 for the corporation in revenue. If the Minister wants to help local authorities which are serious about recycling he should make a special grant of £800,000, which is not so much in the context of £121 million, available to Galway Corporation to enable it maintain its service charges at last year's levels so we do not kill the voluntary effort, and the effort of the corporation and its officials, in implementing a recycling project which will eventually save us from complete dependence on landfill, and which will help us reach the Minister's target of 47% in terms of recycling.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to raise issues of infrastructure and access, which I have been trying unsuccessfully to raise for the past few weeks, both by way of parliamentary questions and on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This £121 million is an increase of approximately 7% on the net expenditure provision in the Minister's Revised Estimate. The additional £80 million for the national road network, £45 <Col N="1351" /> million for water and waste water services and £30 million for the Exchequer contribution for the local government fund will be extremely important.</P>
    <P>As I am not on the select committee I will use this opportunity to raise a couple of issues deemed pertinent to the debate by my constituents. As the Minister will be aware Inishowen has a huge investment of over £27 million in the Pollan Dam scheme which is of great significance to the infrastructure of the region. However, we have very important issues that remain outstanding in terms of connecting those residing closest to the scheme. I ask that when the appropriate applications reach the Minister's table they are expedited &ndash; I know I can rely on the Minister's support on this issue. Similarly, I appreciate the great strides that are being made in relation to waste water and urge the Minister to continue the advancement of schemes which have been prioritised by the county council and on which the Minister has already sanctioned works.</P>
    <P>The most important issues are related to the reference by the Minister to the money sought in this Supplementary Estimate progressing the national development plan's national road network. It is no secret that we in the north-west, while welcoming the concept of improvements to the N2 and A5 are extremely unhappy with the national development plan. With a county which has had job losses only matched in proportion by the lack of job creation, the Donegal task force pointed out our difficulties with access &ndash; they narrowed our problems to access. A cross-Border group made up of all sections of political opinion united on the need for improvements in the N2 and A5. We have had the Minister and various Ministers from the North of Ireland commend the studies that have been launched outlining why the access should be improved and how this could be done. Indeed I was recently informed that we lost a very large potential employer to another county due to the road infrastructural deficit. This is simply not acceptable.</P>
    <P>At a time when we see here today an investment of over £5 billion measured in current prices we along the A5-N2, must gain what the Dublin-Belfast, Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Limerick, Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Waterford routes are gaining, that is, we must have a rapidly delivered portion of those 600 kilometres of motorway or dual carriageway. We must not be deemed second class citizens with a mid D level of service when every other geographical direction around the country gains a C level of service. We must have our case reviewed by the NRA given that the statistics prove that the level of road use is extremely high. We must have real improvements to a journey that used to take 3.5 hours and which now takes an average of five hours.</P>
    <P>It is galling for public representatives and citizens of Donegal alike to listen to the significant improvements that will be made all over the country while we, the only geographical location <Col N="1352" /> to have access pointed out as its main difficulty in terms of tourism, job creation and social ease of movement, are fed the crumbs of some single lane by-passes. When the trains are not running people should stop and appreciate how the people of Donegal feel; they should note that train strikes do not affect us.</P>
    <P>We talk of a national spatial strategy but I sense we would not need too many consultants to point out our deficiencies in achieving a true spatial dimension to development within the country.</P>
    <P>I have already raised the issue with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and others and I reiterate that we have a right to a proportion of the 600 kilometres of motorway or dual carriageway. The Minister has the funds as outlined here this evening and he is willing to develop the country. Too many experts have indicated that access is our key difficulty. We now want the Minister to unlock the north-west as he alone holds the key.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Education and Science shows that during the current year additional funding has been allocated beyond an already generous provision and has been targeted at a number of welcome developments. This Government has made education a top priority and these Supplementary Estimates are further evidence of our commitment. These Estimates which total £192.492 million arise mainly for the following reasons. I intend to arrange for an early payment of capitation grants for primary and secondary schools in respect of the 2000-01 school year. These payments would normally be made in January-February of next year. Capitation grants totalling almost £38 million will be paid before Christmas in order to improve the cashflow of schools, many of which have had to incur higher than usual costs in recent months. I wish to make an additional £17 million available in capital funding for second level schools this year to maintain the momentum of improvement in this sector. This will bring the allocation to more than £120 million this year. This is a four-fold increase over the 1997 Estimates allocation provided for by the previous Government and enables major progress to be made in developing and modernising second level school buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some £8 million is required for the purchase of additional land by Dublin City University to enable it expand the research element of its activity. An additional sum of £5.8 million is required to meet the cost of extra special needs assistants in primary schools. Since taking office this Government has undertaken an unprecedented level of development in special education services. Arising from a Government decision in October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to a response appropriate to their disability and location. More than 1,400 <Col N="1353" /> additional special needs assistants have been sanctioned to date. I am seeking an extra provision of £4.5 million to fund the cost of additional resource teacher posts and to provide teacher posts for the primary education of children of foreign nationals, refugees and asylum seekers. I introduced a new scheme in February 2000 for this purpose to cater for each group of 15 pupils with significant English language deficits.</P>
    <P>In addition, £2 million is required to fund improvements for the first level caretaker-clerical assistants scheme. The extension of the scheme is of particular benefit to small schools with enrolments of 60 pupils or less. I intend to provide an additional £8 million for special initiatives such as once-off development grants to first and second level schools. I will provide details of these grants shortly. The remainder of the Supplementary Estimates relate mainly to technical factors involving demand led expenditure subheads and appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>In summary, additional provision is required for the teacher pension subheads due to considerably increased numbers of retirements for technical accounting factors related to the earlier payment date in December for teacher pensions. There are shortfalls in the third level free fees provision, mainly due to increased enrolments and there are unanticipated additional superannuation costs in respect of third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I am also providing for the funding of pensions for former Carysfort staff who are now working in the third level sector. The receipts from the European Social Fund, now projected to be received by my Department as appropriations-in-aid before the end of 2000, are approximately £88 million lower than originally estimated. The Supplementary Estimate rectifies this shortfall which is due principally to administrative delays within the EU Commission. Overall, these Supplementary Estimates represent significant extra funding being made available to all areas of education. They underpin an unprecedented level of funding for developing and improving current and capital provision and allow for increased allocations for pupils with special needs.</P>
    <P>The additional activities which these Supplementary Estimates will provide will serve as an excellent foundation for further improvements which we will be able to implement over the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these Supplementary Estimates. It would be remiss of us if we did not comment on the fact that the Supplementary Estimates are being introduced at a time of almost unprecedented chaos in the education sector. The Minister referred to this issue in great detail earlier this afternoon. The Minister is aware, as is every Member, of deep and growing anger throughout the country arising from the teachers' strike. I hope he does not hope that parental and student anger will solve the problem. The onus is on the Minister and his Department to solve the problem. I received a number of tele<Col N="1354" /> phone calls over the weekend from concerned parents. This is not something which was happening last year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not dwell on the matter. It is not in order to have a continuation&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell further except to reiterate that the Minister must apply his mind to grasping the nettle and getting the matter under control, otherwise between now and examinations time, the whole education system will be in chaos.</P>
      <P>I welcome the additional funding for special needs, resource teaching and remedial teachers. We have debated with his predecessors the failure of Ministers in all Governments down through the years to put sufficient funding into this vital sector. Anything the Minister does to improve the position is welcome. Deputies are aware that in almost every national school there are further demands for resource teaching, remedial teaching and special needs assistants. I hope the Minister has a mechanism in place to investigate these requests more speedily. Some of the requests have been made for years. Students need immediate help.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to additional capital funding for second level schools. This is welcome. At a time when the economy is booming and when the Minister for Finance apparently does not know what to do with his money I trust the Minister is making stronger pleas for funding for the capital programme. If we do not put the required capital resources in place during the time of the Celtic tiger we will be unable to do so when there is a downturn in the economy. I welcome whatever additional funding can be provided in this regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in regard to the Dublin City University project. This is the former NIHE, Dublin, which has made huge strides in the past decade. The Minister referred to the additional funding being provided for third level grants. It would be silly of us on this side to do anything other than welcome that proposal. We have debated the whole issue of maintenance grants on Question Time recently and the inadequate level of maintenance grants. I shall dwell on it briefly. The student unions, students and parents are lobbying us to put in place a proper system of maintenance grants for third level students. At a time when the average student in Dublin or Cork is paying £60 or £70 per week for accommodation, total grant aid to that student is, at best, £49 per week. One does not have to be an honours maths student to know it does not add up. The Minister will have to apply not only his mind but the might of his Department's financial resources to resolve the issue over the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously I welcome the additional moneys provided and hope the serious problems in the Minister's Department, beginning with the indus<Col N="1355" /> trial relations problem will be dealt with in the immediate future because next month will be much too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the additional funding for education. We are all aware of the shortcomings in such funding and much more is needed than is provided for in the Estimates. I was a little dissatisfied with the Minister's explanation of the background to this Supplementary Estimate. I accept it was difficult to foresee extra demands on funding in some areas but it should have been foreseen in others.</P>
      <P>On capitation, at this stage in the country's development and given the buoyancy in the economy, surely it is time for the State to meet the full cost of education at both primary and secondary level. It is appalling that a great amount of students', parents' and teachers' time, particularly principals' time, is taken up with fund-raising in school. It is intolerable that schools must run cake sales, sales of work, sponsored walks and so on to try to raise the money to meet the day-to-day running costs of schools. I am not referring to sophisticated computers or additional language facilities but to schools struggling on a day-to-day basis to meet the cost of heating, cleaning, paying insurance bills and so on. That is not acceptable in this day and age.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about schools having a cash flow problem and that this is the reason he is bringing forward payment of the capitation grant. I have no doubt schools have cash flow problems but I am not sure the Minister's approach will solve anything. What is needed is a substantial increase in the capitation grant. The increases provided for in the Estimates published last week are miserly. The increase in capitation grants, particularly for second level schools, will not keep pace with inflation in the coming year. Schools are already strapped for cash and the net effect of the small increases in capitation grants will result in the overall income for schools being reduced next year.</P>
      <P>A couple of aspects of the under-funding are having a very detrimental effect on the education system. Many pupils and their teachers are being put under financial pressure because they are expected to make the so-called voluntary contribution. We should not depend on people to pay from £100 to £200 in voluntary contributions, given the money which is available to the State. This imposes huge financial hardship on many families who cannot afford this contribution. Almost every organisation and industry is being provided with grant-aid, yet the State is not prepared to pay for free education. Free education is a myth because it does not exist. Education is provided on the backs of pupils, parents and teachers who must devote ever increasing amounts of time to fund-raising. That is not acceptable at a time when more attention should be paid to meeting the educational, social and psychological needs of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> A small sum of £2 million is provided for support services such as caretakers and clerical assistants. This will not even enable schools to pay the minimum wage to support staff. A great many schools have the equivalent of a half post as caretaker or secretarial assistant. The result is that principals, who should be involving themselves with educational issues relating to their pupils, are spending time cleaning up after drinking sessions in the school yard the previous night, as is all too common nowadays, dealing with blocked toilets, trying to ensure the school is opened up properly and locked in the evening and carrying out minor repairs and maintenance work around the school. Principals are acting as handymen in many schools because of the inadequacy of the caretaker service. In relation to secretarial services, there are huge implications in recent legislation for schools in terms of administration and the back-up services are not being provided.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Estimates but the Minister should go much further to introduce a quality education service to which all children are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the Estimate. However, it would be remiss of a Deputy in the course of a debate on education not to refer to the industrial dispute which is currently taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has pointed out it is not in order to continue the debate on Private Notice Questions. It would be completely out of order to have a repeat of the debate which took place today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister to indicate if he will reciprocate a gesture by the teachers that they will exempt leaving certificate students from any further action. That would be a step in the right direction. The Minister will have to lead on this issue because the education system is falling asunder as a result of what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the extra funding, we have an excellent education system which must be protected. The Minister must do his duty so that students will not suffer. There are many shortfalls in the Estimate with which the Minister must deal. I am particularly concerned about children with special needs. The system works fine for children who can partake in it and who can progress in the normal way. I am always impressed when I visit national schools at the array of computer equipment in these schools, which is excellent. However, children with special needs are not receiving the attention they need. These children are entitled to be treated equally, for which we should make no apology. Funding should be made available for qualified people to help these children. Early investment in this area will pay rich dividends in later life for these children who are entitled to the same opportunities as other able-bodied children. Extra remedial teachers, speech therapists and occupational therapists <Col N="1357" /> should be employed on a domiciliary basis. Handicapped children would achieve much more if teachers visited them in the comfort and privacy of their own homes.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations are trying to offer some assistance in this regard while the State is opting out of its responsibilities. This is not acceptable. The cost of employing people with qualifications in this area may be considerable, nevertheless, that is the least parents of such children are entitled to. Have Members any understanding of the stress, turmoil and extra attention needed in the home of a child with a disability? Many of these families believe the State does not care. This is a result of an ignorance of the need and help that should be provided, which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I spoke previously to the Minister in this regard and I was recently afforded an appointment with my party leader to discuss issues in relation to people with disabilities. I receive telephone calls from parents who are distressed and in a limbo, which is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The countries excellent education system has enabled young people to take up top quality jobs. As a result multi-national industries are attracted to the country. There was a recent announcement in my county of Cavan that a major multi-national company would be setting up an industry there. I am proud that our people are qualified to take up these top level jobs. However, we must not take it for granted that the system will work by simply throwing money at it without addressing the needs that exist. There are needs in relation to third level students for whom the grant is not sufficient to meet their basic daily requirements. Another difficulty is that the grant is provided too late in the school year. In some cases students in third level colleges and in &ldquo;digs&rdquo; away from home have still not received their grant.</P>
    <P>They are still being processed. The Minister cannot make the excuse that students did not apply in time. They applied in good time but the process is delayed because so many questions are asked about income limits. Children are away from home, without money in their pockets and vulnerable. This is particularly true of girls.</P>
    <P>Last night a parent spoke to me about the book grant for national school pupils. Having received the grant, the parent received a bill for £30. There is little understanding of the rise in the cost of school books. The level of the grant does not bear any relation to the cost incurred. I hope the Minister will consider these comments.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister come out of his bunker, meet the teachers and not allow further discrimination against young people who will sit the leaving certificate next June?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today the Minister heard the views of the House on the teachers' strike. I hope he will make the necessary telephone call before the day is out. It is important that the Minster takes the initiative and puts the matter in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> There are four different types of second level schools receiving different levels of financial support. There are voluntary secondary schools, community schools, community colleges and comprehensive schools. The Department of Education and Science sanctions a discriminatory system whereby children at different types of school receive a different level of capitation grant. For example, the capitation grant paid to community colleges is far in excess of that paid to voluntary secondary schools. That is a serious bone of contention among voluntary secondary schools which provided education for a long time with very little support. There is no excuse for having different levels of capitation payment. Why are there different levels? I hope the Minister will not respond by saying this is traditional. He is too bright to hide behind such an excuse. There may be a tradition but the Minister must see that if a tradition is wrong it should be changed. I hope he will address this issue.</P>
    <P>Voluntary secondary schools receive a caretaking grant of between £8,000 and £9,000, although it would be impossible to employ a caretaker for that amount. The level of bureaucracy attached to running a school, and the amount of correspondence and documentation to be dealt with necessitates a full-time secretary. There is a major shortfall in the funding available for the employment of a secretary in voluntary secondary schools while community schools and community colleges do not appear to have any shortage of secretaries. This discriminates against pupils and it is they who will suffer in the long-term.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Boylan raised the question of children with disabilities. More and more children with disabilities are choosing to attend mainstream schools. This brings a major difficulty for teachers and boards of management. If a child with a disability enrols in a small rural school, difficulties arise in accessing additional support services. The school finds it difficult to find out what help is available from the Department to facilitate the child and what capital grants are available to make the school wheelchair accessible, adapt toilets and so on. Quite some time ago the Minister and I were members of a committee which discussed these questions. It was suggested that a booklet be prepared in the Department of Education and Science which would list the facilities available with the names of officials in the Department who could assist in putting them in place. I do not know if this information has been made available yet. From my experience of schools, it does not appear to be. School principals should not have to reinvent the wheel every time they are faced with these difficulties. When they contact the Department they appear to be pushed from Billy to Jack and it takes a long time to secure the services needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any increased spending on education. It is important that we invest resources in education at all levels. I support the Minister in any action he might take to assist pri<Col N="1359" /> mary education. We must begin there. The Minister knows that if a problem is not addressed at primary level it becomes greater as the child moves up through the education system, if the child survives. Will the Minister strengthen the psychological supports and the support services for speech therapy and for dyspraxia, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder and other conditions which present at primary school level and which teachers can identify very early in the primary school.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister carried out a review of the home school community liaison programme and has he plans to extend the programme at the primary school level? This initiative was introduced a number of years ago and has the potential to be highly successful. The programme is intended to identify difficulties early on, support parents and involve the community in supporting parents and schools. This area needs more resourcing and support from the Government. I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this area. It needs a ministerial overview.</P>
      <P>I welcome grants for third level and further education. We all know the stresses suffered by third level students whose grants are patently inadequate. Will the Minister to impress on the Minister for Finance the importance of making further funding available to assist students at third level? Students from rural areas who have to live in Dublin, for example, while studying at third level face astronomical costs and enormous difficulties in finding accommodation. The income level at which grants are given and the amount of the grants are both too low. Will the Minister raise the qualifying ceiling and increase the amount of third level grants.</P>
      <P>There may be advantages in a scheme of student loans. Could a scheme be introduced whereby financial institutions would give students loans at a reduced rate of interest? This happens in other countries.</P>

That underlines the need for State banking and State financial institutions so that lending and borrowing can take place at a rate which is not predatory and that the State and semi-State companies are not ripped off by the banks, which they clearly have been as we have seen with Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.

I was struck that on Second Stage, a number of Deputies from all parties with a background in small business made contributions in which they said how much they valued the role the ICC has played over the years. If anything comes from this whole debate, it must surely be that Government has a continuing role here and, specifically, that that role must be to ensure that facilities are available, whether by venture capital or whatever, to people looking to set up small businesses or people wishing to continue to expand or maintain small businesses, and that that role is fulfilled &ndash; ideally, by the ICC.

      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>)<b>:</b> I made some points forcefully in the first part of my speech in regard to the debts accumulated by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and particularly the management of those debts. I was astounded when the Tánaiste in reply to a parliamentary question told me that since 1987 an incredible £188 million was paid in interest on borrowings of £164 million. It is absolutely incredible that more than the principal amount would be involved in the repayment to the banks of a debt by a semi-State company. I call on the Minister when he replies to explain in detail how this arose and why a semi-State company could have <Col N="1362" /> been allowed to be a milch cow for financial institutions in the way that has been allowed to happen with NET. A more serious explanation is needed. I am surprised this issue has not been raised with more prominence and that certain people in the media have not taken it up.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann&ndash;</P>
      <P>recognising:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy both in terms of sustaining farm families and in contributing very significantly to the Irish export market;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the need to continue the expansion and development of this key sector;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the health benefits associated with grass fed Irish beef if included in a balanced diet;</P>
      <P>noting:</P>
      <P>&ndash;that BSE in animals has been conclusively linked to vCJD in humans;</P>
      <P>&ndash;that the number of cases of BSE in Ireland continues to rise;</P>
      <P>&ndash;that the safety of food for human consumption is a priority;</P>
      <P>&ndash;that there is a lack of adequate facilities for disposal of BSE-infected animals;</P>
      <P>calls on the Government to protect the integrity of Irish beef production and to ensure that instances of BSE and vCJD are minimised by implementing the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;compensate families of victims of vCJD;</P>
      <P>&ndash;establish a trust for any future victims;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> I wish to share my time with Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    <P>The importance of the beef industry to the economy cannot be understated. Beef accounts for well over 50% of our agricultural output and makes up 90% of total agricultural exports. Nowhere else in Europe does beef production form such a vital element of agricultural activity. The fact that Irish beef is accepted throughout the world is a testament to the quality of our produce. No other beef producing nation in the world has the optimum conditions which exist for rearing quality, grass fed beef. The naturally suitable environment which exists here for beef production gives Irish producers a special place in the beef market. The low fat and high nutritional content of Irish beef, which was recently vindicated by Teagasc following its research work at Grange, is something of which the farming community can be proud.</P>
    <P>However, in the past two weeks since BSE re-entered the headlines throughout Europe, Irish beef has been served a blow. In less than 14 days, cattle prices have fallen by over 10p a lb. The IFA estimates that already £500 million has been wiped off the Irish cattle herd. In the interest of cattle farmers, Ireland must lead the way in terms of minimising the risk of BSE contamination in our beef.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Government to table an amendment to the motion tabled by the Labour Party is disappointing. The Government's amendment fails to address all the issues around BSE and vCJD. The amendment is vague. It does little to ensure consumer confidence in our beef and it excludes some crucial matters, such as the disposal of infected cattle. It is my view that the House should not have to vote on a proposal to support &ldquo;the policy of keeping the matter under review in light of the scientific developments&rdquo;. Developments in BSE should be kept under review as a matter of course in the Department. It should not take a motion to ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>A culture of secrecy and paternalism has dominated much of Irish politics. This culture is manifested again in the manner of the release of the figures on BSE cases in cattle in Ireland. Initially, figures were released on a daily basis as cases of BSE came to the fore. Subsequently, as the number of cases increased, it became standard practice for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to release these figures on the last Friday of every month. However, suddenly and without any explanation, the new release date has been changed.</P>
    <P>I expected to have the latest figures on BSE for this debate, but I have just learned that the figures will not be put into the public domain until next Friday. Whatever the reason, in a week that BSE has been in the headlines in almost every country in Europe, it is a bad call to alter the publication date of the number of BSE cases. This culture of secrecy and paternalism has bred the fear and suspicion that we now suffer from as far as BSE is concerned. Whatever the figures for <Col N="1364" /> the month of November, we know for sure that the numbers so far this year are the highest recorded to date.</P>
    <P>Lord Phillips, who chaired the BSE inquiry in the UK, said:</P>
    <P>Ministers, officials and scientific advisory committees alike were all apprehensive that the public would react irrationally to BSE. As each additional piece of data became available, the fear was that it would cause disproportionate alarm, would be seized upon by the media and by dissident scientists as demonstrating that BSE was a danger to humans, and would lead to a food scare.</P>
    <P>With hindsight, a monster had been created by the culture of secrecy and paternalism. People do not need facile reassurances; they need information and the chance to make up their own minds based on facts. This requires that governments and the public alike become comfortable with the concept of risk and uncertainty. It also presupposes that the delivery of the information is not couched in unintelligible scientific jargon. What is needed is the confidence to debate and to agree or disagree. Politicians must be confident enough to say we do not know; these are the facts that we have at present.</P>
    <P>The stakeholders, that is, the consumer and the industry, require openness and transparency. The public must be able to see and, if necessary, participate in the decision making process. This can be done by, for example, inviting consumers to join advisory committees. It should no longer be acceptable to have the token consumer representative. After all, the consumer is by far the most important, as well as numerically the most significant, stakeholder in the food safety business. Advisory committees can no longer be stuffed with the believer &ndash; scientific or political. The layman, the doubting layman and the sceptical scientist must be allowed to participate in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Experts from outside the country, free of any local baggage or interests, must be appointed to relevant committees. Authorities charged with responsibility for ensuring food safety should make their committee meetings open to the public. If the public can attend a county council meeting or sit in the Visitors Gallery in Dáil Éireann, why can they not attend a meeting where decisions are made in relation to food safety? People should be allowed to see how we do our business and the process through which decisions are reached.</P>
    <P>The implications of the BSE scare are enormous for food safety and agriculture not only in Ireland but in every country where BSE is known to occur. In the UK to date, it has taken 16 volumes, two and a half years and £27 million to assess the BSE scandal. This figure does not include the cost to the economy of approximately £4 billion in cattle loss or the ongoing cost of cases of vCJD. The whole drama of BSE in the UK had a cast of hundreds of civil servants, poli<Col N="1365" /> ticians and scientists. It wove its turgid way through many twists and turns of a decade of the most extraordinary policy making. The report is vast but there is one simple message from it &ndash; that the culture of secrecy and paternalism makes bad government, bad science and destroys confidence and credibility. Restoring that credibility is the task ahead for governments and scientists everywhere.</P>
    <P>Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, in cattle manifests itself as a disease in humans known as vCJD. In cattle, BSE is a progressive and invariably fatal degeneration of the central nervous system. In vCJD, the typical symptoms are early onset. Behavioural disturbances are common and they are followed by difficulty with balance and walking within weeks or months. Finally, dementia sets in, leading to profound confusion, disorientation and memory loss. The average survival time is approximately 18 months. The disease in humans is horrific and the loss to the beef industry is huge. As far as we know, all this results from the feeding of ruminant meat and bone meal to cattle.</P>
    <P>Central to the argument on BSE is the importance of meat and bone meal in the spread of the disease. Scientists have warned that BSE transmission through feed is a complex, poorly understood subject. Some animals can eat large amounts of suspect feed and not catch the disease. Others might succumb to exposure to tiny amounts of infected feed. If the meat and bone theory is correct, as is believed by most scientists, there should be a decline in the number of cases of BSE over the next few years. If, however, BSE begins to appear in animals under three years old, there is a major problem.</P>
    <P>It is the most widely accepted theory that meat and bone meal was the vehicle for the transmission of the infective prion that caused BSE in cattle. The ease with which BSE infects other species has varied greatly but it is known beyond doubt that BSE can cross the species barrier. It is astounding, therefore, that meat and bone meal is still permitted in this country as feed for pigs. While there is no official ban on its use in poultry meal, that industry has introduced and agreed a voluntary ban. However, it is still permitted for pig feed and 18 people have obtained licences for its use.</P>
    <P>The compelling evidence that meat and bone meal was the vehicle for BSE in the first place, combined with the fact that avoidance of cross-contamination of ration intended for ruminants is difficult to avoid, is more than enough to insist on an immediate ban on the use of any animal material as animal feed. Permitting the use of meat and bone meal in pig feed is an invitation to fraudulent or accidental cross-over use by farmers. Public health must take precedence over economic considerations in this case. There is no margin for error in dealing with BSE or new variant CJD.</P>
    <P>The Phillips report in the UK noted there were delays in taking decisions and, more importantly, <Col N="1366" /> a lack of rigour in implementing them, specifically that the monitoring and regulation of slaughterhouses and rendering firms was considered to be lax. Based on this kind of acknowledgement, it is extremely important that the continuing use of meat and bonemeal in any animal feed is recognised for the potential risk it poses. It would be extremely arrogant and cavalier to ignore the lessons of the UK, as far as BSE is concerned.</P>
    <P>The pigmeat quality assurance scheme of Bord Bia requires that, among other conditions, the pig producer must, &ldquo;purchase feed free of meat and bonemeal and with full traceability and declaration of ingredients, as per the Marketing of Foodstuffs (Amendment) Regulations, SI No. 261 of 1993&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For quality to have any meaning in this context, we should be certain that all pig products with this quality mark are derived from animals guaranteed to have been fed on a diet free of meat and bonemeal. At present 18 pig farmers are licensed to hold meat and bonemeal on their premises. Our major export market in the UK requires that pigmeat for sale there is derived from animals fed on a diet free of meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>The pigmeat quality assurance scheme operated by Bord Bia should not apply to any pig farms that have a licence to feed meat and bonemeal. Furthermore, any Irish meat factories that wish to use the quality assurance label on their produce must be able to prove they do not source pigs from farms that have a licence for meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>In France, there is mounting evidence that the reason for the increase in the number of cases of BSE lies with the government's refusal to impose a ban on the use of cattle remains in all kinds of animal feed. The French have now banned meat and bonemeal in pig feed, but they have pointed out that the ban is pointless if meat and bonemeal pig meat from other countries is allowed into the country from other sources. In the UK, the pig industry is equally concerned that only pigmeat from animals that can be shown to be free of meat and bonemeal diets will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Banning meat and bonemeal in one European country is pointless unless the ban extends across all countries because of the way in which pigs may be traded across national boundaries. To assure the consumer and the industry, a Europe-wide ban on meat and bonemeal in any animal feed should be introduced.</P>
    <P>Experimental results available in 1990 showed that just half a gram of infected meat and bonemeal could cause BSE in a cow. Cross contamination should have been recognised as a problem at that stage. The Phillips report in the UK states that a cow can become infected with BSE as a result of eating an amount of infectious tissue as small as a peppercorn. Cross contamination in feed mills resulted in the continued infection of thousands of cattle.</P>
    <P>Despite detailed licensing recommendations here, it is difficult to take on board that the type <Col N="1367" /> of controls that are outlined could be effectively enforced. Apart from any other consideration, the policing of the process is next to impossible.</P>
    <P>However, a quote from the advisory committee established in 1996 might help to give a perspective on it. In the understated way of committees, it was noted that, &ldquo;In view of the emergence of BSE, it would be wise to assess the risk to both animals and humans of recycling of mammalian derived protein between species&rdquo;. That was the view of the advisory committee, reporting to the Minister, in 1999. I await the implementation of that understated recommendation for the protection of the consumer, to prevent cross-over contamination to cattle feed and to protect the pig industry.</P>
    <P>Power struggles and turf wars between different Departments and their officials must not be allowed to influence the process of ensuring safety. It is neither reasonable nor sensible that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should have any responsibility for food safety. Responsibility for food safety should become the preserve of the Department of Health and Children. Where trade interests and safety are controlled, however tenuously, within the same Department, it puts an impossible burden on that Department to be impartial. Whatever changes are necessary should be introduced to ensure there are no loopholes whereby the health of the population can be put at risk because of interdepartmental power struggles.</P>
    <P>The human form of BSE, that is, new variant CJD, is complex and poorly understood. The average incubation periods for both BSE and CJD are unknown, but most scientific findings point to an average of ten years. It has been suggested that people may develop new variant CJD up to 40 years after eating infected meat. Further research on a similar disease indicates that the mean incubation period in people is 30 years or more. If the numbers of new variant CJD double for just a few years in the UK, then the numbers could be in the thousands.</P>
    <P>Against this background, any compensation packages in place must be considered very carefully. So far, this country has recorded one case of new variant CJD. However, the reality is that it is almost inevitable that more cases will emerge with time. We know that BSE is present in the animal population. We are also told that one animal could potentially contaminate 400,000 people. In that case, it is almost sure that more cases of new variant CJD will be diagnosed.</P>
    <P>It was originally assumed that new variant CJD affected young persons only. The recent incident in the UK, where a 74 year old man died of new variant CJD, has introduced a new dimension to the risks associated with BSE.</P>
    <P>I have asked that compensation for victims of CJD be made available. It is impossible to predict the numbers of CJD cases that might emerge over time but, whatever those numbers, there should be compensation arrangements for the families of <Col N="1368" /> victims. Furthermore, there should be a trust set up to guard against large numbers of CJD cases emerging over a number of years, so that the families of those people who are unfortunate enough to become victims have the reassurance, at least, of some financial support.</P>
    <P>In recent days, a number of proposals and restrictions have been introduced to monitor cattle for the development of BSE. Up to now, it was only those cattle that displayed the obvious symptoms that were tested. It is now proposed at EU level that random testing of all cattle over 30 months should take place.</P>
    <P>This does not go far enough. Assuring the safety of our food is the first consideration. From a trading point of view, it should also be included as a protection for purposes of our export market. A full testing programme would help to restore confidence in the cattle industry and reassure importing countries that best practice was being enforced for Irish beef.</P>
    <P>While no test is 100% reliable, the ENFER test that is available is validated by the EU. It would introduce a level of confidence for both the consumer and the producer. The ENFER test is now widely used in many countries. It will detect BSE in cattle where the typical spongiform symptoms have not yet appeared. It provides the best current assurances in relation to the safety of beef, as far as BSE is concerned. I welcome the support by the IFA for a full testing programme. I was pleased to see that yesterday the Minister recommended full testing, which I proposed last week during an adjournment debate.</P>
    <P>It is amazing there should be any resistance to the concept of full testing for BSE. It is standard practice to carry out thousands of tests daily on meat samples for the presence of a large number of bacteria, for example. Many of these tests are very expensive and time consuming to carry out, but they are now routine and provide a level of assurance about the safety of the product. The ENFER test provides a result within 24 hours, thus giving the best available assurances to the consumer in relation to BSE.</P>
    <P>It is important, however, to be conscious that increased testing will almost inevitably lead to the detection of more positive cases of BSE. It is better that we should know the real situation and not continue to live in cloud cuckoo land, pretending that we have BSE free cattle when we are not doing the test to find out their status.</P>
    <P>Testing of all animals is very welcome. I endorse the Minister's support of that yesterday. Commissioner Byrne, however, was quite correct when he stated that no country can guarantee their meat is free of BSE. The natural limitations of any test preclude such conclusions.</P>
    <P>The lessons of the UK should act as a reminder to us that making such assertions is highly dangerous. The British minister for agriculture stated in 1990 that British beef was perfectly safe. Certain actions were taken in the UK, following from which the minister stated that &ldquo;These actions fully protect the public from what is a remote and <Col N="1369" /> theoretical risk&rdquo;. In this case, the overt message of certainty went beyond the scientific evidence.</P>
    <P>Against that background, this country should endeavour to put in place the most rigorous tests and controls available, but should acknowledge that absolute safety can never be guaranteed and that one can never prove a negative. To date there is no satisfactory disposal method for carcasses that are infected with BSE. The report of the advisory committee on BSE, which was established under the last Administration to consider the then BSE crisis, advised against burying carcasses. Nevertheless, this became common practice and would most likely have continued but for the recent incident where a carcass was discovered and removed from the burial site. The alternative arrangements now in place are unsatisfactory as the carcasses remain in cold storage. This cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. It does not get rid of the material but stores it to be dealt with later. While there is resistance to incineration in this country, the Minister must look to the best available technology for the safe and satisfactory disposal of the carcasses.</P>
    <P>There is a theoretical possibility that BSE is present in sheep, although it has not been found occurring naturally. Current research to look for BSE in sheep is costly and slow. There is, therefore, a need to develop a rapid test so that large numbers of sheep can be tested to reduce the uncertainty of whether or not BSE occurs</P>
    <P>It is feared that scrapie might mask the symptoms of BSE in sheep. Unlike in cattle, BSE in sheep is not confined to specific organs and tissue, such as the brain and spinal cord. Sheep with BSE would have to be destroyed and no part of their carcasses allowed into the food chain. At present, the potentially most infective tissues are removed and not used.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more than any other area of food safety, BSE is characterised by scientific uncertainty. This uncertainty means that current risk management options for protecting the health of the public are precautionary in nature and are aimed at risk reduction in the light of current knowledge, recognising that risks may not be totally eliminated. For this reason alone, this country must not be stingy in the funding of research into BSE. There are many areas in need of research, including the development of a method to detect people incubating the new variant CJD; the risk, if any, from blood transfusions; further studies on sub-clinical forms of BSE to determine if apparently healthy animals may be harbouring the infection; development of a diagnostic kit for screening of live animals; rapid differentiation of BSE and scrapie strains and tests to determine the risk, if any, from milk.</P>
    <P>The cattle trade in Ireland must be protected and our export market must, as far as possible, be supported. So many people depend on agriculture for a living that it is crucial that all efforts are made to retain the confidence of the importing countries. Equal care and consider<Col N="1370" /> ation must be given to the home market and to our imports.</P>
    <P>For reasons of protecting the health of the Irish consumer, the most rigid controls must be in place to ensure the safety and integrity of any foods imported into Ireland. Has it been clarified, for example, that all beef imports from the UK over the past ten years have originated there? What controls are in place and what auditing procedures exist to guarantee the safety of imports? Recent figures from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development show that Ireland imported 34,500 tonnes of beef from the UK in 1995. Do all of these products show the country of origin, so that we know that the product came from a country where BSE had not been reported as required?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the tests are carried out, the audits available and the documented evidence to ensure that all imports have met the required standard? In the absence of a declaration of the country of origin on the packaging, it is asking consumers to make a great act of faith if they are to trust imported products for the future. In light of what we now know about developments in Germany, for example, it is important that we pay more attention to our imports. Up to very recently, Germany did not have a ban on SRM, or specified risk material, in foods for human consumption.</P>
    <P>In the light of an EU report on Border inspection posts in Ireland, published in February of this year, it is clear there are many gaps and loopholes in the way business is conducted in this country as far as food safety is concerned. The report highlighted an alarming number of deficiencies in the regulation of imports at Border inspection posts. More recently, the detection in Northern Ireland of spinal cord in beef carcasses originating in Ireland, provided evidence of serious breaches of the legal controls.</P>
    <P>A number of key questions remain unanswered in relation to BSE and CJD. It is not clear why CJD attacks predominantly young people. One explanation is that they eat disproportionately more beefburgers, some of which may have contained high risk material. It is possible that because young people suffer more frequently from illness such as tonsillitis, they are more prone to transmission through broken skin or mucous membranes. Estimates of the size of the epidemic in the UK, for example, have shown that it is impossible to gauge the extent of the problem. Not enough is known about dose, route of exposure, incubation period, genetic susceptibility, and scale of species barrier between cattle and humans.</P>
    <P>The origins of BSE remain a mystery. We may never know how it first developed. The best guess is that a sporadic form of the disease probably occurred in the 1970s through some kind of freak genetic dysfunction. These and many other questions remain to be answered about BSE and the human new variant CJD form.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that a number of the <Col N="1371" /> decisions taken in relation to the management of BSE in Ireland were good. Slaughtering an entire herd where one infected animal was detected was a very positive move and it may have helped to contain the development of the disease. Introducing the 30 month rule was also a positive move.</P>
    <P>However, among the recommendations made by the advisory committee that reported in 1999 were that burial of BSE animals on farms should cease; effective incineration facilities for carcasses of BSE suspects should be provided as a matter of priority; the efficient removal of tissues designated as SRMs from the animal food chain is essential; effective controls should be in place and proof of implementation should be available and constantly reviewed and a full-time epidemiologist with appropriate support staff should be appointed to evaluate all aspects of the epidemiology of BSE in Ireland. Some at least of these recommendations are not in place. I call on the Minister to ensure the full implementation of these and other recommendations made by the committee.</P>
    <P>With the advent of and the escalation of BSE many of the old certainties about food safety have been demolished. Survival of an infective agent under extreme conditions, infectivity by an agent devoid of any genetic material and crossing of the species barrier by the infective agent are just some of the new facts that we have had to come to terms with. More significantly, perhaps, is the fact that the concept of risk and uncertainty are part and parcel of food safety and that this must be communicated to the farmer, meat processor and consumer alike. Most significant of all is the fact that public health is more important than any short-term economic considerations.</P>
    <P>In 1988 a middle ranking civil servant in the Ministry of Agriculture in the UK noted:</P>
    <P>We do not know where this disease came from, we do not know how it is spread, and we do not know whether it can be passed to humans. The last point seems to me to be the most worrying. There is no evidence that people can be infected but we cannot say that there is no risk.</P>
    <P>However, for the next eight years expert committees, UK Ministers and civil servants, including two chief medical officers, reassured the public that there was no risk in eating beef. There was an enormous sense of betrayal once it became obvious that they had all got it wrong.</P>
    <P>There are many costly lessons to be learned from the disaster in the UK. Ireland has been remarkably lucky in many ways but our luck will run out unless we are significantly more proactive and open in addressing the BSE problem. Whatever actions are needed to protect public health must be taken, regardless of the economic cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion proposed by Deputy Upton and congratulate her on the comprehensive case she has made for it. The Govern<Col N="1372" /> ment's amendment to the Labour Party motion is an abdication of responsibility to the farming community, beef exporters and consumers. The motion is an attempt to instil as much confidence as possible in the Irish beef industry in the wake of the re-emergence of Europe-wide fears about the dangers of BSE and the risk it poses to humans. The Government's amendment is a fudge. It is a poor attempt to walk away from the responsibilities of tackling the fundamental issues associated with BSE.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me tonight I wish to deal in particular with the disposal of BSE infected animals. It is clear from the Government's decision not to mention the word &ldquo;disposal&rdquo; in the amendment that it does not have the will to ensure that BSE animals are disposed of in a way that will reduce any possible risk to other animals or to humans. It was only last month when it emerged that a BSE infected carcass was buried near the source of four group water schemes and 15 wells in Galway that we saw action by the Government on the recommendation in the advisory committee report, which had been sitting on the Minister's desk for some time, that the burial of BSE animals on farms should cease.</P>
      <P>It was particularly disturbing that this burial in Galway was close to the source of group water schemes. We know we have serious problems of pollution with rural group water schemes. The EPA report shows that approximately 42% of all rural group water schemes have some degree of pollution. It is particularly unacceptable that the degree of pollution which already exists in group water schemes should be added to by the potential of contamination of water supplies by the burial of BSE infected animals. Following the disclosure of the burial in Galway, it appears there are many other locations throughout the country where infected animals were buried. I expect that as local authorities begin seeking information on these burial sites a worrying picture will emerge.</P>
      <P>At the time the information on the Galway burial broke, officials at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development said they did not have any option other than to bury the cow in question. Newspaper reports which appeared in subsequent days suggested the Department would continue to bury infected animals because it did not have any alternative, particularly in light of the fact the State does not have an incinerator. Eventually, after some pressure, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development climbed down and at the beginning of this month announced an end to the burial of BSE infected cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While burial may have ended, we still do not have any disposal facilities for BSE infected animals. Even if we proceed with another rendering plant, we will not deal adequately with the issue of disposal. At present, the rendering plant which operates in Cavan only serves to transform BSE infected animals into a compound of meat and bone. The problem of infected matter still exists <Col N="1373" /> and we are forced to export it somewhere else. This is a costly and unsatisfactory exercise and does not provide the guarantees needed that BSE infected matter is not left lying around posing risks to humans and animals. We do not have the facilities to ensure the safe disposal of infected animals. If we are to have any confidence in the system which deals with the disposal of BSE infected carcasses, the incineration of those carcasses in Ireland must be considered yet again.</P>

      <P>Incineration is a contentious issue which must be seriously examined given the priority which must be afforded to food and water safety. I was impressed recently by a statement by Professor Emer Colleran, a former chairperson of An Taisce, who acknowledged that incineration was the best available technology for the disposal of BSE infected animals.</P>
      <P>We should reflect on the lessons we could learn from other scandals and problems associated with health risks. The Lindsay tribunal is currently dealing with the degree to which blood was infected. As each day passes at that tribunal, it is interesting to note that the response of responsible State agencies in the early stages when people became aware that blood was contaminated was to play it down and not to scare the public. They said the scientists knew best and that unless there was an absolute assurance about the scientific evidence the precautionary principle did not apply. It is interesting that the same type of approach is now being taken in relation to BSE.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton rightly referred to the inappropriateness of having the issue of food safety and quality lodged in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I understand the difficulties the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State have in balancing the requirement to protect the interests of the producer and the industry from a run on beef if there is concern about BSE with their responsibility to ensure that food safety and quality is protected for the public. However, it appears that in balancing those respective responsibilities the Department has consistently erred on the side of the producer. The consumer and the issue of food safety take second place in relation to BSE. That cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Upton's suggestion that responsibility for food safety and food quality must be transferred from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to the Department of Health and Children. From the point of view of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and of ensuring that the industry is protected and developed, a more open approach on the part of the Department and the Minister is necessary in respect of this issue. We should not underestimate the degree to which members of the public have a much better understanding of the balances which must be achieved. We should not adopt the rather paternalistic approach frequently taken by the Department and the Minister, an approach which is underscored, in his usual buffoon-like way, by the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words from and including &ldquo;calls on the Government&rdquo; to the end of the motion and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;supports the Government's measures to protect the integrity of Irish beef production to ensure that instances of BSE are minimised by implementing the present stringent controls in Ireland to safeguard consumer health and to eradicate BSE from the cattle population;</P>
      <P>supports additional measures being introduced as appropriate to further re-enforce consumer confidence;</P>
      <P>&ndash;supports the policy of keeping the matter under review in the light of scientific developments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am confident that when the House becomes fully aware of the background to this issue it will support the range of measures that are in place and in the process of being introduced to protect public health and to eradicate BSE from the cattle population.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue in this House today and I am confident that all Deputies will contribute in a constructive way to the debate on this matter, which is too important to be divisive. I acknowledge the expertise of Deputy Upton in respect of this matter. Her contribution was constructive, erudite and professional. She obviously drew on her wealth of professional experience in framing that contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate allows me to describe, in the clearest way possible, the approach the Government has taken to controlling and eradicating BSE, to ensuring that the health of consumers is protected and assuring the quality and safety of our beef. It also provides me with the opportunity to allay public concerns in relation to BSE arising from recent events in Europe where a number of issues, including the higher number of cases of the disease in France and the recent confirmation of cases in Spain and Germany, have seriously affected consumer confidence in these and other countries. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, will deal with the public health aspects and the food safety <Col N="1376" /> aspects that fall within his remit when he addresses the House tomorrow.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is worthwhile recalling the background to BSE. This new disease in cattle was first reported in the UK in November 1986. The first case of BSE here was confirmed in January 1989. In that year, a total of 15 cases were confirmed and for the next six years, the number of cases remained low at between 14 to 19 per year. In 1996, the number of cases increased to 74 while in the following years, there were 80, 83 and 95 cases, respectively. For this year, the total number of cases stands at 120 with four further cases detected under the programmes of testing of animals from depopulated herds and of active surveillance. To date this month, 19 cases have been detected under the normal surveillance regime and one further case which was identified under the active surveillance regime was subsequently confirmed at my Department's laboratory.</P>
    <P>The practice in the Department has been to issue figures detailing the incidence of cases at the end of each month. It will be no different this month. When the final results are received on Thursday we will publish them as usual. If we had published the results on Friday last, for example, people would have inquired if we were hiding something in respect of the cases discovered during the last week of the month. That is not the case. We report faithfully and transparently the cases for each month at the end of each month. It is peculiar that the first day of the month will be a Friday, but we must wait until the end of the month to release the figures. There is no other way to deal with a disease such as BSE other than by adopting a totally transparent approach.</P>
    <P>Although the numbers for this year and for this month are the highest recorded here, it is essential that they be seen in their proper context, both statistically and against the background of the stringent controls that we have in place to deal with BSE and to protect consumers. Notwithstanding the higher numbers this year, I remain satisfied that the comprehensive range of measures we have in place is proving effective. In the first instance, the overall incidence of BSE continues to be extremely low with a total of 556 cases since 1989 in a cattle population in excess of 7.5 million. This compares with a total of more than 177,000 in the UK and a peak of more than 37,000 confirmed cases in 1992 alone in a cattle population of 12 million. To put our position into perspective, the disease incidence here represents 0.0012% of our total cattle population.</P>
    <P>The higher number of cases here this year was foreseen in the recent report of the European Union's scientific steering committee which predicted a temporary increase in numbers for the next two years from animals infected prior to the measures introduced in 1996 and 1997 taking full effect. That committee also concluded that the Irish system was &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo; from 1998, meaning that the measures in place since then prevent the agent of BSE from reinfecting cattle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> The predictions of the scientific steering committee in relation to a temporary increase in the numbers of infected animals have been borne out by the increased number of cases for this year. Of more significance, however, is the increasing age profile of BSE positive animals detected. To date, no animals born after 1996 have been detected with BSE and an ever increasing proportion of infected animals are six years of age or older. That means that prime Irish beef is completely free of BSE because it comes from Irish steers and is not sold to consumers at that age. This supports the scientific steering committee's conclusion that the Irish control system is optimally stable, meaning that the control measures in place in Ireland prevent the recycling of the BSE agent through ruminant feed. In addition, we have various control measures, in place to protect consumers.</P>
    <P>From the early stages, we have had an extensive range of surveillance and control measures to deal with BSE and these were significantly revamped in 1996 and 1997 in the aftermath of the announcement of the possible link between BSE and new variant CJD. In my opinion the Irish control and eradication system is now among the most comprehensive the world. As Deputy Upton stated, however, we have a great deal to learn about this disease and she suggested that we carry out more research in our quest for knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Irish controls, which operate at a number of levels, include a legal obligation on veterinary surgeons, farmers and all persons in charge of bovine animals to notify the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of any animal infected or suspected of being infected with BSE; the depopulation of the entire herd where BSE had occurred and the destruction of the carcasses; the tracing and culling of all birth cohorts of infected animals; the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from all cattle and sheep, thus ensuring that these materials are excluded from the human food chain and the animal feed chain; the rendering of the remaining animal waste which excludes specified risk materials in accordance with EU rules, namely, 20 minutes at 133º centigrade at three atmospheres of pressure; and the effective application of stringent rules in relation to the manufacture, possession, sale and storage of meat and bone meal. The feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants is forbidden and feed mills manufacturing ruminant feed are not permitted to have meat and bonemeal on the premises.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, all cattle presented for slaughter at meat factories are subjected to an ante mortem inspection by veterinary officials of my Department. Animals showing signs of ill health which give rise to a suspicion that they may be affected by BSE are returned to the farm, put down and tested for BSE. All casualty and emergency cattle presented for slaughter are, in any event, rapid tested for the disease and the carcass is retained until a test result is received showing that BSE is not present. The <Col N="1378" /> recent events in Europe have given rise to unilateral actions by France, Spain, Austria, Italy and Germany which is symptomatic of the tremendous political pressure being brought to bear in these member states, to introduce measures which they see as necessary and to reassure their consumers. It must be remembered that these concerns were not based on any new information or scientific developments as regards BSE or CJD but rather on a desire to demonstrate that actions were being taken.</P>
    <P>It was critical, in light of these events, that the Council of Ministers should move quickly to re-establish a community approach to dealing with BSE by adopting a series of supplementary measures which will help to restore consumer confidence in beef in Europe and in third countries. After 17 hours of discussions last week, the Council issued a statement which emphasised the wide range of measures already in place to control BSE and noted the importance of effective implementation of these measures. The Council also welcomed the Commission's proposal to extend rapid screening tests for cattle at risk from the beginning of next year and in the light of the results of that programme to extend it to categories of cattle aged over 30 months. The exclusion of fallen animals from meat and bonemeal was also agreed in principle. The additional testing and the exclusion of fallen animals from feed were finalised at a meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee last week and these are now binding decisions on all member states.</P>
    <P>The Council also considered the national measures adopted by a number of member states. It was agreed that these would be evaluated by the EU Scientific Steering Committee and a decision would be taken by 30 November 2000 either on their admissibility or a further strengthening of Community measures. The Council is scheduled to reconvene on 4 December to discuss relevant issues again.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the protection of consumers has always been our primary concern in dealing with BSE. We are all only too well aware of the horrific nature of variant CJD and its devastating effects on those concerned and the families and friends of those affected. The medical and scientific professions have not yet established the full facts regarding routes of transmission and consequently we must continue to act on the precautionary principle.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the range of control measures we have in place to deal with consumer protection. We keep these controls under ongoing review in consultation with the Food Safety Authority and adopt new measures as they become necessary and available. In reply to the previous speaker, the Food Safety Authority is under the aegis and responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children and his Department. It is a public health matter. I cannot understand how any experienced Member of this House could come here and talk about food safety matters being matters for the Department of Agri<Col N="1379" /> culture, Food and Rural Development other than put it down to mischievousness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland was established by this Government in 1998 for the protection of the consumer. It was a deliberate Government decision to put the authority under the Minister for Health and Children. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children will be in the House tomorrow to ensure the health and public health aspects of this animal disease are presented to the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>There has been a very close working relationship with the FSAI on this issue. In this regard, we have already commenced an active surveillance programme using one of the EU validated rapid tests. These tests can provide an additional layer of protection over and above protections already in place. Consequently, I strongly supported the Council's decision on additional testing and I have already confirmed my intention to proceed with an enhanced BSE testing regime in Ireland in advance of the Community requirement to do so. The House will be aware that since July this year, we have been random testing a proportion of animals for BSE. I now intend to expand this programme considerably to cover older animals as soon as the practical arrangements are in place. It might be of interest to Deputies to know that there are about 750,000 involved in any one year in relation to that testing.</P>
      <P>I am pleased by the reaction of Irish farming and meat industry groups to this proposal. It is fair to say that both have reacted in an extremely responsible fashion in supporting these measures. My officials have been seeking to iron out a number of the logistical and operational issues inherent in the expanded testing programme. I assure the House these officials will continue in the coming days to put the necessary arrangements in place at the earliest possible date. The ENFER test or any of the pre-validated tests are post-mortem tests, in other words, they are carried out on carcases. That presents its own difficulty in that the tests will have to be carried out in the processing plant. It would be very helpful to the process of eradicating BSE if a test were developed for live cattle <i>ante mortem</i> and one could take a blood test and have a result in four hours. One can imagine the difficulty if one takes a sample from a carcase and four hours later, the different parts of the animals are gone and all must be traced. It is a logistical matter which we are ironing out and seeking to get a handle on and ensure we can have extended testing in place at the earliest possible opportunity. I am talking about far sooner than is required by the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On meat and bonemeal, I have already mentioned the comprehensive range of controls in place to ensure that ruminant animals in Ireland do not have access to feeds containing meat and bonemeal. One of the facts to emerge from recent <Col N="1380" /> events in Europe is the difficulty which some member states had in the implementation of their meat and bonemeal controls. This related largely to their apparent failure to eliminate the possibility of cross-contamination of ruminant feeds in feed mills which were incorporating meat and bonemeal into feed for pigs while at the same time manufacturing ruminant feeds. The critical matter concerning meat and bonemeal is to avoid cross-contamination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about feed for poultry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a relevant matter as well. In Ireland, meat and bonemeal is subject to stringent controls both in terms of its production and its use. These controls have been inspected by a range of external bodies including the FVO and veterinary services of countries to whom we export beef products, all of whom have deemed them to be satisfactory. The Irish beef industry is very vulnerable to external matters like the French problems which arose a couple of weeks ago and which immediately had an effect on us. On the other hand, it is helpful to us in maintaining the most stringent controls in that our customers worldwide send their inspectorates here, including their veterinary inspectorates. In fact, some countries have resident veterinary inspectors in Ireland to ensure that our controls are comprehensive and watertight.</P>
      <P>As regards meat and bonemeal production, the controls require that the material used to make the meal meets certain standards and excludes all risk organs known as specified risk materials or SRM &ndash; these are removed and destroyed separately &ndash; and that the product is manufactured to approved scientific standards based on time temperature parameters with heating to 133ºC, at 3 bar pressure for 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>In terms of use, there are also strictly applied controls involving the licensing of any person manufacturing, incorporating, storing or feeding this meal. In addition, manufacturers of food for cattle and sheep are forbidden from using meat and bonemeal. Non-ruminant feed rations containing meat and bonemeal cannot be manufactured on the same premises as ruminant feed.</P>
      <P>Full-time Department staff are based in rendering plants and a series of mission visits by the EU Food and Veterinary Office have indicated satisfaction with Irish BSE controls, including those on meat and bonemeal. The new fallen animal policy here will further improve the safety of meat and bonemeal by excluding the use in feed of the offal of cattle which have not had <i>ante mortem</i> veterinary examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress that neither the EU Scientific Committee or the FSAI's BSE sub-committee has recommended a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for non-ruminant feed. However, in view of the difficulties being experienced in many other member states which do not have comparable controls to ours and the central role played by the product in the wider BSE issue, the future of meat and bonemeal as a feed is kept under constant review. As of now however, there is no scientific evidence or control reasons to justify <Col N="1381" /> the introduction of a meat and bonemeal ban in Ireland. The EU Commissioner, as late as this week, indicated that he sees no necessity for such a move for those member states where effective controls are in place and applied. The debate and the scientific analysis will continue over the coming days and the EU Scientific Steering Committee will further evaluate the product and its use as a feed. Ireland will obviously keep the situation under continuous review and will be guided by scientific and technical advice and decisions taken at EU level. In summary, we have invested a great deal of time and effort in getting our controls on meat and bonemeal right but if an alternative approach is identified at EU level and by a scientific committee and if it says that we must discontinue feeding meat and bonemeal to non-ruminant animals, we will implement it, based on professional scientific advice given to us. That has not been the advice up to now.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the policy of burial on farms of suspect carcasses and under strict veterinary supervision has been discontinued. Although this method of disposal is one of those allowed under European Commission rules and while it was never a preferred solution here, there remains no readily available alternative owing to the absence of incineration facilities in the State. If any local authority tells me that it has given planning permission for an incinerator and that it is going ahead and will be available in a week's or a month's time, I will be very pleased about that, because we need a waste disposal system&mdash;</P>

      <P>Carcasses which are BSE positive are currently being removed from farms and kept in cold storage. That is not a preferred option and is, obviously, not a long-term option. It does not get rid of the problem which still exists. However, I am actively seeking alternative arrangements for the ultimate disposal of these carcasses. In this regard my Department is pursuing a number of specific possibilities. I can assure the House that there will be no delay in utilising appropriate disposal measures as soon as they become available. The difficulty in putting in place a long-term solution should, however, not be underestimated and identifies the critical need for us to get our national waste disposal arrangements in order.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of confusion in relation to the connection between scrapie and BSE. Scrapie has existed for more than 200 years and there is a small endemic level of the disease present in most countries in the world in which sheep are reared. In Ireland the incidence of the disease is extremely low, with some nine new cases found in additional flocks each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> To date no naturally occurring link has been established between scrapie and BSE. Recent research by my Department's Central Veterinary Laboratory in conjunction with the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and the Conway Institute in UCD involved a comparison of a number of isolates from scrapie samples found in Ireland with BSE. The conclusion of this research was that the scrapie isolates were quite different from those of BSE. In relation to the specific possibility of scrapie &ldquo;masking&rdquo; the symptoms of BSE, a considerable amount of research is being conducted by my Department's Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, in conjunction with the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in UCD and experts in other member states, into this and other issues in relation to the propagation and control of scrapie. This research is continuing both here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Education and training of all those who may be involved with BSE is vitally important, and my Department has been actively involved in this. We advertised some time ago for two epidemiologists, but there was no response to the advertisements. We have now trained one and another one is ready for graduation very shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the dissemination of information on BSE to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers and butchers, my Department has done its utmost to ensure that all those involved in the industry are well informed. Information leaflets have been distributed to farmers at marts. In addition, the Department has produced a video on BSE which is available to veterinary surgeons. The video has also been distributed to all veterinary officials and meat factories and to factory management who have been advised to show it to all staff involved in the selection of animals for slaughter. Copies of the video have also been distributed to local authority vets who have responsibility for controls on local authority abattoirs. My Department has made strenuous efforts to keep all those involved in the industry fully informed, and I will continue to treat the provision of appropriate information to those who need it as a priority. If some of the media outlets were helpful in relation to the dissemination of positive information, it would be more helpful than the sickly-looking cow we have been looking at for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>As regards training, the industrial training programme for meat industry operatives is being developed by FÁS in conjunction with my Department, the meat industry and other meat regulatory bodies. The programme is progressing well with the beef abattoir pilot programme nearing completion. Training of operatives at these slaughter plants is under way. The programme is ongoing and will be subject to external audit to guarantee its integrity.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it is clear to all of those who have taken even a passing interest in this topic that my Department has always dealt with the issue of BSE in an open and transparent manner and that information has been made available through replies in this House, the Department's web-site and through the media on a regular basis. I have already acknowledged the absolute <Col N="1383" /> necessity of maintaining public confidence in the beef industry and I have no doubt that the best way to do this is to provide the public with the most up to date and comprehensive information available in relation to the controls we implement and in relation to the incidence of the disease in Ireland. I am happy, therefore, to continue to keep the public and the media fully informed in relation to this disease, as I have up to now.</P>
    <P>Let me refer now to market issues. Our beef and cattle industry is the cornerstone of the agricultural economy. We are the largest exporter of cattle and beef in Europe. It is vitally important to us that there should be confidence in the industry both at home and abroad. We export cattle and beef to about 60 countries world-wide. Despite the difficulties in the past ten years, which were extreme, especially in 1996 following the House of Commons statement, while there were dips in our markets internationally, we recovered them and maintained the confidence of consumers in countries abroad in our systems in Ireland. I am glad that this debate tonight is being conducted in a very responsible way and that comments about BSE in Ireland are well-informed and measured in their tone and accurate at all costs.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the debate in the House tonight relates to food safety and the assurances we can provide to the consumers of Irish beef, both at home and abroad. I have outlined the comprehensive range of measures in place in Ireland to ensure the product of Ireland's cattle and beef sector reaches the final consumer with the maximum guarantee as to its safety. It is only by ensuring that the correct measures are in place and are properly implemented that we can give the necessary assurances about the safety of the product. It is only when the consumer recognises that this is the case and feels confident in the final product that the market can be restored to normality.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise one point &ndash; food safety is an absolute prerequisite for any food producing industry. If it is not set down and maintained as a fundamental element, the industry cannot survive. The Irish beef sector recognises this and has fully embraced and supported the measures put in place in the past years to deal with BSE. There is a lot at stake. Beef exports last year were worth about £1 billion, excluding EU export refunds. Direct payments to the sector amounted to almost £0.5 billion. There are about 100,000 farmers whose livelihoods depend on the cattle and beef industry at primary production level with a further 5,000 employed in the processing sector.</P>
    <P>Following the BSE developments in 1996, Ireland has succeeded in regaining all its major markets throughout the world. Today, we export to over 60 countries worldwide and our systems on the ground are found to be acceptable. That is not just from a distance. Inspectors visit Ireland and reside here and we keep in very close touch with the markets on an ongoing basis, working with An Bord Bia, our embassies abroad and our network throughout the world to make sure they are fully informed of our systems here. That is <Col N="1384" /> happening on a daily basis. On top of that, if I or any of the senior officials or inspectors of veterinarians in the Department need to go to any one of those countries, we are on standby to do that.</P>
    <P>Recent developments have put pressure on the sector from a commercial point of view. There has been a slow down in purchases within the EU and this is evident in terms of the effects on cattle prices here, because cattle prices have dropped by about 10p a pound for steers and by very much more in the case of cow beef. The main issue is a fall-off in consumer confidence. Action is needed to support the market. In this respect I have put great pressure on Commissioner Fischler and I am glad he has introduced two measures &ndash; aids to private storage and a fairly substantial increase in export refunds, 15% on steers and 130% in the case of female beef. That should be helpful. Contrary to earlier indications, the beef processing sector is likely to take advantage of APS to remove surplus cow beef from the market. I thank Commissioner Fischler for these measures which should help to relieve the market. However, additional measures, including intervention purchasing, may be necessary if the current difficult situation continues. I was glad, over the past 24 hours or so, to put a £28.5 million package in place to help the beleaguered industry, and, last week, an £11 million package for the disposal of fallen animals.</P>
    <P>The current difficulties facing the beef sector pose a strong challenge to the Irish beef industry in terms of maintaining market outlets and in reassuring consumers about the image and quality of Irish beef. We are fortunate in that, ahead of most other countries, we have the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, which is a computerised control system. Farmers deserve credit for implementing the system. All cattle are registered in Bandon and passports are available for every animal in the country. The national beef assurance scheme is also proving extremely helpful in restoring confidence worldwide and proper traceability is now possible.</P>
    <P>The Irish control and eradication system is among the most comprehensive in the world. It has been examined and endorsed on a number of occasions by the food and veterinary office of the European Commission and I referred earlier to the view of the EU scientific steering committee. In addition, Ireland is recognised by the World Animal Health Organisation as having a low incidence of BSE and our cattle are in high demand in markets throughout the EU. Given our high level of exports, our systems and controls have been subjected to in-depth examination by a number of countries to which we export products and we operate our controls in close association with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland with which we are in constant contact.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, we cannot and will not become complacent in regard to BSE and will continue to be open and transparent about the matter. The relevant experts and I take some comfort from the fact that the lower number of BSE cases this year aged five years or less tends to confirm the views of the scientific steering committee that we can expect to see a reduction <Col N="1385" /> in the number of cases from 2002 onwards. A very clear pattern has emerged and it remains the Government's clear objective to eradicate BSE at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>We are fully aware that consumer protection and the well-being and importance of the beef industry are at issue. I emphasise that there is no resistance in the industry to new controls which will improve the situation. People in the industry recognise that the sector would not have any future in the absence of consumer confidence. The various controls which are in place will be strictly enforced and enhanced, as appropriate, by measures such as the BSE active surveillance programme to provide appropriate protection to consumers at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion, as amended, to the House.</P>

      <P>I commend the Labour Party for tabling this motion. We must approach this issue in a very responsible way in the interests of the industry, a fact which has been borne out by the responsible contributions of Members. I see very little in the motion with which the Government could disagree. The Minister did not refer to the need to compensate the families of new variant CJD victims or to establish a trust fund for future victims. Perhaps Government speakers would refer to that tomorrow evening. We must demonstrate our concern for victims, although their numbers may be small.</P>
      <P>We must take every possible action to boost consumer confidence in what is a very safe product and no stone should be left unturned in this regard. I was perturbed recently to discover that cattle were being buried. In the eyes of the consumer, that carries a potential risk to water supply, however small. I welcome the fact that the Government has recognised this and has banned the burial of such animals. The problem remains as to how the remaining material will be disposed. Incineration is probably the only option in this regard. In exporting this material, we are merely shipping our problems overseas. The Government must address this issue eventually and should have the courage to provide an incinerator for this purpose. What will happen if other countries refuse to accept this material in the future?</P>
      <P>The feeding of animal ruminant protein to animals, including non-ruminants, is a controversial issue. The Minister stated that there is no scientific evidence to the effect that this poses risks. We should not wait until such evidence is available because that might be too late. Instead, we should be proactive and put measures in place at this stage which will eradicate any possibility of risks in this area. I accept the Minister's statement that no risks have been proven but this is a tricky issue and we cannot afford to wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his achievements to date with the EU Commission. On the Adjournment last week, the Minister assured me <Col N="1386" /> that no problems were being experienced in regard to the shipping of live exports. I urge the Minister to re-examine this matter because I have contrary information to the effect that ships have not left Cork in the past two weeks. The Minister is due to come before the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine tomorrow and I would be grateful if he would ascertain the exact position on this matter prior to that meeting. I want to offer the Minister an opportunity to correct the record if the information he received last week was incorrect.</P>
    <P>Other countries have not dealt with this issue as proactively or as honestly as Ireland. The challenge currently facing us is that we must continue to boost national and international confidence in our product. I understand that beef in other counties is totally BSE-free and in this regard I would urge the Minister to introduce testing for all animals as soon as possible. The Minister stated last week that he hopes to put such testing in place. I am aware that the logistics involved are huge but all animals entering the food chain must be tested at the earliest possible date in order to boost confidence in the product.</P>
    <P>Dr. Paddy Wall of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is on record as stating that we must not only say food is safe, we must also be able to prove, without question, that it is so. We know our beef is safe but we must be able to prove it. I will support any efforts the Minister takes to test all animals entering the food chain. The Minister stated that this would prove very costly but he should put the matter out to tender at the earliest opportunity. Some 100,000 farmers depend on this industry and we cannot allow this cornerstone of the agriculture industry to be further damaged.</P>
    <P>The current and former Governments have done a great deal to address this issue. I urge the Minister to consider supporting the Labour Party motion. That would send out a positive signal. I do not believe the Government could be opposed to compensating victims or to establishing a trust for future victims. In regard to introducing legislation to prevent the feeding of animal ruminant protein to animals, including non-ruminants, further research may be required in this area. The motion also seeks the testing of all cattle intended for slaughter for BSE and it is the Minister's intention to do this eventually, although I believe it should be done as soon as possible. The House should not divide on the proposal to provide adequate and appropriate disposal facilities for BSE-infected animals or to ensure that research into new variant CJD is adequately funded.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion also seeks the conduct of research to establish if sheep are harbouring BSE and it is important that this is done. We have been informed that adequate education and training programmes for farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers and butchers are being provided. The Government could not disagree with the necessity to undertake the communication of risk to the public and to assist in the interpretation of information given. I fail to see why the Minister is insisting on dividing the House on this issue. Perhaps he will reconsider <Col N="1387" /> this matter so that we can show a united front for once.</P>
    <P>I will support any positive action the Government takes in this area. I again ask the Minister to look at the motion and to say tomorrow night that we should go forward together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably the most important issue this Dáil will discuss for the next number of years in terms of the interests of farmers and given that we export so many of our cattle.</P>
      <P>We missed the opportunity to introduce compulsory testing when BSE first presented itself a few years ago. Had we introduced compulsory testing for every animal we could say to the world that we were leaders in this area, that our cattle are guaranteed BSE free. While testing for TB cost the taxpayer a significant amount of money, the Government should examine the introduction of compulsory testing for BSE.</P>
      <P>This is too serious an issue with which to play politics. The Department has announced that in future all BSE infected animals will be frozen and not buried. What are the plans for carcasses already buried? Does the Department intend exhuming these animals, and is doing so safe? We saw in Galway that BSE infected carcases were buried near streams. Have local authorities been notified where carcasses have been buried? I ask the Minister to change the law in relation to notification. Currently if one animal is tested positive for BSE the Department is not obliged to notify the local authority or the health board. I ask the Minister to make compulsory the immediate reporting of infection to the local authority and health board, even when it is only one animal, and to inform them what happens that animal.</P>
      <P>Are the Minister and the Department quite satisfied that carcasses which are buried do not pose a danger to the general public, or will it be necessary to exhume those animals and bring them to Abbotstown? Is there enough room at Abbotstown for the animals? We must reassure the general public and I ask the Minister to do that tomorrow night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have learned that the cost of not disclosing information is tribunals which cost millions of pounds, the one on the beef trade resulting in no prosecutions. The information which the Minister and Department have should be made known to the general public. There is no reason to hide anything in the Department. The minute a Minister or Minister of State begins waffling in the House and does not give correct information, the general public, the country and the world will say there is something wrong. The consumer must be reassured. We must take no risk with the industry or people's health and we must not be afraid to tell the people of the country and the world about the information held by the Department. We do not want people to lose trust in the industry or in the Departments of Health and Children and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. That <Col N="1388" /> would be a setback for the country. We have always been proud of our beef and we want to be able to go to Europe and the world saying we have the best tested and best beef in the world. We must reassure the consumer who is the boss. We saw how depressed the beef trade became in the past when the consumer lost confidence and we do not want that to happen again. We must reassure people abroad that our beef is safe and make all information available to the general public.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept the Labour Party motion and the Dáil should not divide on the issue. There is not much difference between the motion and the amendment, and I compliment Deputy Upton for bringing her motion before the House. It is an important debate and we want a reasoned discussion. We do not want people making silly statements; rather we want to reassure people that our industry, the Department and the Government are doing everything possible to ensure we have the best product. We must let everyone know what is happening. If we do that then the beef industry and Ireland will be the real winners.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow morning the Minister and his officials should contact Deputy Upton and arrange to have an agreed motion, even if some amendment is necessary. This is not an issue which should divide the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this very important issue. The proposals of the Minister, set forward in recent days, will be very important if implemented in terms of the industry. However, I warn the Minister that one of his predecessors, Deputy O'Kennedy, when he was Minister brought a very good Bill before the House in 1989 which restricted the use of meat and bonemeal etc. Unfortunately, the staffing necessary to give effect to the Bill was never provided. That is no fault of the current Minister. It was only with the outbreak of BSE that it was realised nothing had been done in terms of implementing the provisions of the legislation. We want to ensure such a thing does not happen again.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comment by the Minister that &ldquo;It remains the Government's clear objective to eradicate BSE at the earliest possible date&rdquo;. I hope that will be so, but it has been our clear objective to eradicate TB and other things in the past but because of lack of personnel and effort things were not done as well as they should have been. Therefore, it is important this is dealt with in a positive and proactive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused by the headlines in today's newspapers which spoke about relief of £28.6 million which was going to farmers. It sounds great, but in reality it amounts to £4.72 per suckler cow and £3 for special beef. The reality is that I have had farmers and some of their family members contacting me in desperation saying that in most cases they cannot get anybody to quote them for culled cows, a very important element of our <Col N="1389" /> product. In those areas where they are quoted for, the figure is 50p per kg over a certain weight but if it is under that weight the figure is 30p per kg.</P>
    <P>When we had the first cases of BSE the Minister was on this side of the House and I well remember him being very aggressive and having all the right ideas on how to cope with the problem. In terms of steers, £3 is being made available. Tom Parlon, quoted in today's newspapers, talks of a drop of £75 per head. Deputy Yates, when he was Minister, provided £50 per head of cattle, which was joked about by the current Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party. The Minister must realise that farmers are experiencing a severe crisis and do not know where to turn. It is impossible to sell cattle at present. Young men who tried to build up an industry find they cannot get customers.</P>
    <P>The Minister clearly remembers that when the BSE crisis first hit it was supposed to be the fault of Deputy Spring, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, for not going to Iran and other such places to open markets. Much has been done to prove Irish beef is perfect and beyond question. If that is so, the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be trying to ensure every market is open so that livestock farmers and the economy are not further damaged. The efforts being made by Bord Bia and others to re-establish Irish beef in the European market was significant but the reality is that given the problems in France and Germany we need to look at other alternatives.</P>
    <P>I ask that herds closed due to BSE be treated in a more positive and friendly manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I call for an urgent review of the restrictions imposed in April by the Tánaiste on the social employment scheme. Effectively it has meant that many of the schemes that operated successfully in rural and urban areas are either coming to an end or those which have been planned will not come to fruition. The Minister of State is well aware of the valuable work done by means of these schemes down through the years. Under the scheme, many small communities have improved their environmental landscape and amenities and many physically disabled persons had personal assistants, all of which is coming to an end. I fail to understand how any Government can stand idly by and allow this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious, as is the Minister of State, that initially these schemes were intended to have a high training input. Many people who can avail of this training want to be employed in their own community because they do not have transport and they do not have any training beyond that <Col N="1390" /> received from the community employment scheme. Will the Minister review, as a matter of urgency, the fact that persons of 55 years of age or over who have been employed in community employment schemes are being put on the scrap heap? Will the Minister review the restrictions and allow those persons continue in community employment or FÁS schemes until retirement age as there is no other alternative for many of them? They are not capable of being employed in the traditional or ordinary manufacturing areas. At 55 years of age they are forced into getting a job or are left idle. They want to work but the Government is denying them the opportunity to continue in work.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State and I along with our other colleagues attended a meeting in Tuam of about 200 or 300 people directly involved in FÁS schemes, the message came loud and clear that these people wanted to continue in community employment and wanted to work in their community for their community. They are being denied that opportunity. Those in the 40 to 55 age group should be allowed work for the three years, opt out for one and become re-employed. That is not happening. There is a raft of about 50,000 to 60,000 people throughout the country in this catch 22 situation who want to work. Because of their previous history and training up to now, they are unable to command the job opportunities in this Celtic tiger economy in the same way as younger people. We cannot turn our backs on them. Neither can we turn our backs on those who provided the training and supervision, all of whom support the notion that those who have a tradition in those schemes are probably the best people to continue in them.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister of State not to turn his back on those with physical disability who have relied on FÁS and social employment schemes for their personal assistants. Now they are restricted and confined. Many who went out to work in the past are unable to get outside their houses because of being denied personal assistants through the restrictions put in place by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that when the social employment schemes were introduced the Progressive Democrats did not give them much credence. They said these schemes were for cutting briars and nettles. This view is coming back at us again. I do not want any patronising jargon from the Minister of State. I ask him to face reality, to provide a proper scheme and lift the restrictions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not give patronising jargon, I give facts. To say there are 50,000 or 60,000 persons involved in this scheme is ludicrous. The total number involved altogether is 37,500. Let us start with facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of community employment as an active labour market programme, is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. The programme was introduced in 1994, to replace a range of initiatives which existed at that time, including the <Col N="1391" /> social employment scheme, which I think the Deputy has in mind. At its height it operated at a level of around 40,000 participants.</P>
    <P>The programme was restructured by the Government in 1999, following a consultancy review, to take account of the tightening labour market, and to refocus the programme on older persons and those most removed from the labour market. The principal feature of the restructuring was the introduction of a phased reduction in the number of participants on community employment to 28,000 by 2003, through transferring the resources for 5,000 places to the social economy programme, and by reducing the numbers of places otherwise on the community employment by 4,500, from the 1999 average provision of 37,500.</P>
    <P>There are currently 33,412 participants on the programme, which has a target average participation in the region of 35,500 in 2000.</P>
    <P>Under the restructuring the eligibility age for the part-time integration option under community employment, was raised from 21 years to 25 years with a number of exceptions, including offshore island residents and 18-24 year olds referred under the employment action plan who have been unemployed for 18 months.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of community employment, includes a three-year cap on participation and an increase from the six months required between schemes to 12 months, with effect from April 2000. These changes were introduced to discourage repeated participation in community employment and to give individuals the opportunity to undertake training-education programmes where possible, or to utilise the service of FÁS placement officers and-or the local employment service. Offshore island residents are also exempted from this change.</P>
    <P>I am particularly sensitive to the needs of older workers in rural areas and their situation is being reviewed pending the introduction of suitable projects under the social economy programme.</P>
    <P>The reduction in absolute numbers participating on the programme, together with the changed eligibility criteria are considered to be appropriate, given the present economic climate and buoyancy in employment projections. Community employment is intended to be a progression programme and it would be inappropriate to allow almost permanent presence on such a programme, while employees are being recruited from around the world to fill vacancies in even the least skilled categories of employment. I am sure the House will agree that it is essential in the interests of the persons concerned, that we should make the most of the present opportunities to re-integrate and offer employment opportunities to the maximum number of those still unemployed.</P>
    <P>Our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment intends to keep the continued operation of community employment under close review, in the context of the restructuring of the programme and the changing labour market environment.</P>
    <P>In addition to community employment, the new social economy programme, which was for<Col N="1392" /> mally launched by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, on 18 September 2000, will provide urgently needed local services and employment opportunities and experience for people who have been distanced from the labour market. This new programme is aimed at providing up to 2,500 jobs, for the long-term unemployed particularly in disadvantaged communities. This programme is being funded through a reallocation of community employment funding.</P>
    <P>The key aims of the social economy programme are to support the regeneration and quality of life of local disadvantaged areas and to maximise employment opportunities for long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged persons. The programme will support the development and operation of social economy enterprises that provide social services and employment opportunities in and for disadvantaged communities. Financial grants and technical supports are provided for the development of social economy businesses for up to three years. This includes grant support for the development of a business plan.</P>
    <P>The national development plan provides for expenditure of £213 million on the social economy programme over the period between 2000-06. It is expected that expenditure in 2001 will be £17 million and it is forecast to rise to £41 million per annum, as the demand for the programme increases.</P>
    <P>As identified in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and during the review of the job initiative programme, some people, including those currently on the job initiative programme, will have difficulties getting and keeping a job in the open labour market due to personal barriers such as age, health, literacy and numeracy factors. Additional long-term supports are needed. Our Department is currently developing proposals for appropriate supports for such persons, taking into consideration discussions already held with the social partners and a number of submissions received from the statutory and voluntary sectors. Final proposals are expected to be ready for further discussions with the social partners in the very near future.</P>
    <P>We are confident that all these measures will be effective in reintegrating the long-term unemployed and those most removed from the labour market, particularly those in the higher age groupings, into jobs and other options relevant to their circumstances. The House can be assured that the Tánaiste, Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and myself, together with the management of FÁS, will ensure that the maximum practical flexibility prevails in the interest of continuous opportunity for the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science is not here to reply to this matter. However, if it is an indication that he is at last concerning himself with a resolution to the ASTI dispute, I will excuse his absence from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> I am raising on the Adjournment the subject matter of Parliamentary Question No. 912 which I tabled on Tuesday, 7 November. The Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Woods, replied to my question on the extension to St. Mary's Secondary School, Macroom, as follows:</P>
    <P>My Department's planning and building unit is currently examining the stage 4 submission (detailed design) for the proposed extension at the school to which the Deputy refers. Once this examination is complete and, if found to be in order, the issue of progressing to stage 5 &ndash; bill of quantities &ndash; will be decided. A decision regarding the invitation of tenders for proposed remedial works to the roof of the PE hall at the school will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>I wish to be as frank and honest as possible in debating this issue because I believe it is more than five years ago since I made representations to the Department about an extension to St. Mary's Secondary School, Macroom, and repairs to the PE hall. Since I made these representations, almost a full cycle of second level students have completed their education at St. Mary's Secondary School without adequate provision for PE, adequate classroom facilities, science laboratories etc. being available to them.</P>
    <P>This is a damning indictment of how we do business because five years ago the school authorities and board of management and the Department of Education, through its inspectorate and schools building unit, recognised the shortcomings, yet we have meandered our way in a casual stroll-like fashion through the procedures to such an extent that as at 7 November as shown in the Minister's reply we are at stage 4 and perhaps proceeding to stage 5. It is very difficult to explain to parents, staff and pupils that these inexcusable delays are somehow justifiable, because they are not. If in 1995 the Department recognised there were shortcomings in the school infrastructure, it should have been possible long before now to resolve them. I believe it is as symptomatic of how the school buildings unit of the Department does business as it is of the failure of Government to provide funds for the extension. When this Government came to office there was the bones of a resolution to many of these problems in the proposals for local self-governance on education matters through the Education Bill which the previous Minister for Education had been piloting through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The new Minister, Deputy Martin, threw the baby out with the bath water Perhaps some aspects of the Bill were not quite palatable but there was a structure in the vocational education committees which could have been modified to take into account all primary and secondary school policy decisions. That vehicle could have been expanded to accommodate the needs of teachers' and parents' representatives on the board and given a system of local decision-making on education matters. Given that the Minister threw the baby out with the bath water we must now make representations to the school building unit in Tullamore for every pane of glass which needs to be repaired in the school. This is ridicu<Col N="1394" /> lous and inefficient and it will now cost significantly more to build the extension than if the work had been carried out quickly in 1995. However, the approach of successive Administrations to all school buildings is to procrastinate and delay. The only way to resolve this issue is to provide the decision-making authority at local level, similar to the health boards, whereby priorities can be made on the basis of annual financial allocations. Then we would not be hiding behind stage 4 or stage 5 procedures.</P>
    <P>The reality is that this project is long overdue. Two successive Administrations have had the issue before them for a considerable time. I urge the Minister of State, primarily on behalf of the students who, I regret, are not centre stage in many education debates at present, not to let another full cycle of second level students go through St. Mary's Secondary School, Macroom, without adequate PE facilities, science laboratory facilities and all the other classroom facilities necessary to deliver a modern quality education service.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline my Department's proposals in relation to the provision of an extension at St. Mary's Secondary School, Macroom.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to provide some background information on this case. The junior school and St. Catherine's date from the 19th century. The main school building consists of a two story structure built <i>circa</i> 1965 and the high school extension was built in 1981. The school authority made an application for additional permanent accommodation in 1995. My Department's planning section examined this matter and in May, 1995, recommended that the requirements of the school in the future should be based on a long-term enrolment projection of 375 pupils.</P>
      <P>The accommodation requirements of the school were then assessed by the Department's senior inspector. Following this assessment and revisions requested by the school principal, a schedule of residual accommodation was drawn up which formed the basis for any extension at the school. Due to restraints on capital funding at that stage, my Department was not in a position to proceed with the appointment of a design team. However, in October 1997, a letter issued to the school recommending the nomination of a design team in order to initiate the architectural planning of the proposed extension.</P>
      <P>The new accommodation currently being planned includes three general classrooms and a number of specialist rooms, including a science laboratory and a mechanical drawing room. The first three stages of architectural planning have already been approved and in February 2000 my Department issued approval to the school authority to proceed to stage 4 of architectural planning, that is, the detailed design stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 2000 the school authority requested grant aid to purchase a plot of land to extend the general purpose area. Under revised arrangements introduced by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, my Depart<Col N="1395" /> ment purchases the site for any proposed new school. However, in this instance funding was not provided towards the purchase of this site as it would mean the convent order would own the school site, yet the Department would own a small plot of land adjacent to the school. I am sure the Deputy will agree that would not be sensible. However, the Department approved the extension of the general purpose area from 84.4 square metres to 138 square metres.</P>
    <P>In September last the Department received the stage 4 submission for the proposed extension and this is currently being examined by the Department's staff. Once this examination is complete, and if found to be in order, the issue of progressing to stage 5, the bill of quantities stage, will be decided.</P>
    <P>As this project is still in the architectural planning it is not possible at this stage to sanction the invitation of tenders. However, the Deputy can be assured that due to the vast amount of money allocated for capital development within the Department and included in the Book of Estimates which will be translated into cash liquidity in the budget on 6 December next and thereafter transferred to the various Departments, the matter will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Myshall is a typical small rural village with a population of approximately 150 people and the usual few pubs and shops, a sub-post office, a national school and a community hall.</P>
      <P>I support the Government policy of the relocation of asylum seekers throughout the country with each area taking its fair share, as the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny has done in Kilkenny city. The choice of location should not be based simply on the availability of accommodation. We should also consider the impact on the local population. In Myshall this will mean an overnight increase in the population of 25% with no support services to help with language and other difficulties.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the parents and friends of autistic people in the Carlow-Kilkenny area, the Irish Society for Autism identified the centre in Myshall, County Carlow, earlier this year for the purpose of developing a service for young adults with autism. While the ISA attempted to put together a successful bid for the property the Office of Public Works swooped in with a bid of over £400,000 more than the ISA had available to it through its voluntary fund raising and bank loans. The Government must stand four square behind a project that will assist the ISA in rescuing these unfortunate individuals from tragic lives spent in the misery of a psychiatric institution or other unsuitable accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there are more than 50 families in the Carlow-Kilkenny community area and there is no autism specific residential care. Parents are no longer prepared to tolerate psychiatric or institutional care as a life-long option for their children, nor should they be asked to do so. <Col N="1396" /> Under the European Charter for Persons with Autism, people with autism have a right to accessible and suitable housing. Yet, eight years after that document was ratified by the European Parliament, hundreds of autistic people are still placed in totally unsuitable conditions. The development in Myshall is a light at the end of the tunnel for disabled children and their parents, families and friends.</P>
    <P>The ISA and I fully support the Government's response to the refugee crisis, particularly because, as a group and as individuals, they have themselves been the victims of discrimination. However, parents feel the property in question would, in the long term, be better used for the provision of a life-long service to individuals who need special care and attention with dignity and respect.</P>
    <P>The ISA proposes the development of the centre of excellence for the ongoing care of people with autism at Myshall, County Carlow. The centre will care with up to 20 persons with autism. Many people with autism now reside in totally unsuitable conditions in psychiatric hospitals or other institutions.</P>
    <P>The society proposed a five year plan of development to be undertaken between the ISA, the South Eastern Health Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. To date, the society has had a meeting with the deputy chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board and he supports the plan. The health board recognises the need to plan for the future and has entered into discussions with the local parents, through the Carlow-Kilkenny branch of the Irish Society for Autism which represents the 50 families in the Carlow-Kilkenny area. They have also agreed to fund a population study in order to ascertain the true extent of the problem. There are known to be more than 100 persons with autism in the region.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the many parents and people with autism in the Carlow-Kilkenny area, I thank the Minister of State for his efforts to date and I thank the Minister for Education and Science who recently made an announcement to this effect. I urge on the Minister of State to do everything in his power to ensure that this issue is brought to a satisfactory conclusion for all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister thanks the Deputy for raising this matter which has been the subject of some speculation in local and national media over the last year. The Deputy is referring to a domestic property located at Myshall, County Carlow, which came on to the property market earlier this year. The property in question was offered to the Office of Public Works in January, following an advertisement by that office in the national newspapers for suitable properties for Government use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Society for Autism has expressed an interest in purchasing the property with a view to developing it as a residential centre for persons with autism in the region. However, when the Office of Public Works indicated its intention to <Col N="1397" /> purchase this property the office was not aware of the society's interest in it. It was initially the intention that the property would be used by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the South Eastern Health Board having the first option on its subsequent use. Officials from my Department are currently in contact with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of Public Works in this repect. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has been in touch with the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen. He is sure there can be some flexibility on this issue and is working to this end. I am sure the Deputy will welcome this news.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Aylward is aware, a significant investment is currently being made in the development of services to persons with autism and those with intellectual disability. Decisions concerning the allocation of funding for new developments in services to persons with disabilities, including those with autism, are a matter for individual health boards and are taken in line with the priorities which have been identified for each region through the established planning and consultative structures.</P>
    <P>The residential facilities provided by the Irish Society for Autism can accommodate persons from a number of different health board regions. Officials from my Department will be meeting with the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Irish Society for Autism early in January 2001 in order to discuss an overall strategy for the ongoing development of services for persons with autism. I am sure the building in question will be considered at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for making himself available to respond to this important debate.</P>
      <P>Yet another shameful episode raises serious questions about our treatment of those trying to enter the country, especially from certain parts of the world and about the regime which operates in our name at Dublin Airport. A group of seven Pakistani businessmen arrived in Dublin Airport with passports in order, visas issued by the Irish consulate in Karachi, a letter from the company whose equipment they were coming to inspect, return air tickets to Pakistan and adequate cash to sustain them during their sojourn in this State. They had complied with all lawful requirements. They had done everything by the book yet they were refused entry and subjected to the ordeal of spending three days in the training unit of Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had a group of Irish businessmen been treated in this way in any state, for example Pakistan, there would have been outrage with angry statements from Members and Ministers and protests to the Pakistani ambassador. The refusal to allow the group to enter the country may have been lawful within the most narrow and technical definition but it was not just. The group may well pursue their right to seek compensation through the courts for <Col N="1398" /> their appalling treatment but, regardless of legal rights, common decency and good manners suggest that they are at least entitled to a public apology. I invite the Minister, as the person with political responsibility to this House and this country for immigration matters, to proffer that apology to the seven men concerned.</P>
    <P>If this were a once-off occurrence, one might be willing to dismiss it as a terrible mistake, but unfortunately it seems to be part of a pattern which suggests that the policy for dealing with those trying to enter this State from certain parts of the world is at best cold and insensitive and at worst cruel. What I and the Minister know is that a similar delegation arriving from, say, New Zealand or Australia with the same level of documentation and information would not, by any stretch of the imagination, have ended up in Mountjoy Jail. That is an undeniable and appalling fact.</P>
    <P>We simply do not know how typical this particular case is but we know it is not unique. My colleague, Deputy De Rossa, raised in this House last June the case of a Japanese woman coming to Ireland for Bloomsday who was held incommunicado at the airport. Earlier that month, the Polish counsel was reported to have protested to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the treatment of seven Polish nationals who were refused admission. These cases may well represent the tip of the iceberg. We do not know how many people have been held on arrival and sent straight back on the next available flight. We do not know how many people were held in Mountjoy and because of language difficulties or because they did not know about our legal system were not in a position to seek the legal remedy sought in this case.</P>
    <P>A number of procedural changes must be introduced given what has now happened. Where it is intended to refuse admission to a citizen of a country where there are resident diplomatic relations here, the very minimum that is required is that the ambassador or counsel of the country in question is informed of the refusal. Apart from any other consideration, a diplomat may be able to assist in differentiating between bona fide travellers and others who may be attempting to enter illegally. There should also be an automatic provision of legal advice before anybody is refused. The Legal Aid Board should be given the resources to provide an on-call solicitor in such cases. It should not be left up to the individual who may know nothing of the Irish legal system or where or how to go for help.</P>
    <P>Where does one start when one does not even know the name of a solicitor? In the case of this Pakistani group, people will have heard Mr. Niazi, who is very familiar with Ireland, describe on RTE this morning how he had to phone dozens of solicitors before he got one willing to act on his and his groups behalf. This should be provided automatically. If the immigration officers are acting legally and reasonably, then they have nothing to fear from the provision of the services I have now demanded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this matter. It is important that I preface my remarks this evening by pointing out that the question of costs in the proceedings taken in this case has been adjourned to enable both parties to present further affidavits. The group of persons refused entry will provide an affidavit within one week and the State is to respond within a further week. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that my remarks must be such as to not prejudice the court's fair consideration of these matters.</P>
      <P>The position is that the immigration authorities in this instance came to the conclusion that the group planned to travel to Northern Ireland without the necessary authorisation. The group had completed landing cards giving a Northern Ireland address, had no accommodation booked in Dublin and had open return tickets. Although two of the group had visitor visas for the UK, the others had no authorisation whatsoever in relation to entry to the UK. The immigration authorities contacted the Tyrone-based firm which had issued the invitation and which had undertaken to be responsible for the group's arrangements while in the State. The firm confirmed that it was expecting the group but had not made definite arrangements to meet it as yet. The immigration authorities were satisfied that the group intended to travel to Northern Ireland. They were refused entry on that basis under the Aliens Orders and detained in the training unit, Glengariff Parade, pending their return on Sunday, the next available routing.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the possession of a visa does not guarantee entry, although failure to have one, if required, is grounds for refusal, and this is made very clear in the information provided with the visa application form. All non-EEA nationals, whether visa required or not, require leave to land upon arrival and in this case the group in question failed to satisfy the immigration authorities that they should be landed.</P>
      <P>Following an <i>ex parte</i> application on Saturday, the High Court made a number of orders in respect of the group, including an injunction restraining their removal and an order requiring them to be presented in court on Monday to inquire as to the legality of their detention. Following the hearing in court on Monday, the seven concerned were released from custody by agreement between both parties on foot of certain undertakings given by their legal representatives and on the basis of the additional information which was provided and which had not been available to the immigration authorities the preceding Friday. As I have said, the court is to consider the question of costs further and I should emphasise, made no orders in so far as the decision of the immigration authorities was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the more general issues raised, one would be forgiven for concluding from some of the public comment on this issue that immigration procedures in Ireland operate in an indiscriminate, paranoid or even racist fashion. The <Col N="1400" /> reality is that a tiny proportion of all passengers are refused entry to the State and that every effort is made to minimise the inconvenience to genuine travellers. In this regard, Irish immigration procedures operate in a manner not dissimilar to those which apply in many other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Experience, however, tells us that checks are very necessary. Many of the persons who enter the country illegally, including in order to claim asylum, come through normal port and airport routes often with false papers or under the pretence that they are genuine tourists, students or business visitors. The State relies on the vigilance of immigration officers, often dealing with extremely large workloads, to intercept such persons and to prevent our immigration controls from being undermined. These are not new developments and the State has, under successive Governments, always applied controls of this nature in the public interest.</P>

      <P>In the past fortnight alone we are aware that business visas have been abused by two separate alleged business groups from China and Pakistan, respectively. In both instances, we became aware that the groups were not genuine when the companies which had invited them contacted us following their failure to appear as arranged. It is also not unheard of for some members of a group to be bona fide but for others, who are not bona fide, to be brought along in exchange for payment.</P>
      <P>In the less immediate past, most people will recall the abuse of the visa system by a bogus Romanian choir last year as well as the abuse on an enormous scale by a supposed film production company in order to smuggle Indian nationals into the UK a month ago. Less high profile abuse takes place an a day to day basis &ndash; for example, by persons purporting to be students only to immediately disappear into the black economy either in Ireland or the United Kingdom. The reality is that a certain amount of abuse will also, inevitably, go undetected.</P>
      <P>Advice is, however, available for genuine travellers from outside of the European Economic Area who wish to ensure that they clear immigration quickly. Such advice includes being in possession of the necessary funds, having firm accommodation arrangements and definite return flight plans. It is also advisable in cases of business visitors for the inviting company to send a representative to the airport to meet their guest and to assist in whatever inquiries need to be made.</P>

      <P>The threat of force by the Beijing authorities to bring about the reintegration of Taiwan is a matter of great concern to the Government. This threat was articulated in a White Paper on Taiwan published by the Chinese authorities earlier this year. Our concerns have been conveyed to the Chinese authorities on every appropriate occasion. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste both availed of their meetings with their Chinese counterparts earlier this year to urge them to pursue their objective of reintegration with Taiwan through peaceful dialogue, without the threat of force. These concerns are also shared fully by our EU partners and have been conveyed to the Chinese authorities most recently at the EU-China summit which took place in Beijing in October.</P>
      <P>Ireland has accepted the &ldquo;one China&rdquo; policy of the authorities in Beijing since 1979. This policy has been followed by successive Governments since then. It is our understanding that this policy is firmly based, on the part of the authorities in Beijing, on the concept of &ldquo;one-country, two-systems&rdquo;. The &ldquo;one China&rdquo; policy is also accepted by other countries which maintain diplomatic relations with Beijing, which include all of our EU partners and the United States. We therefore envisage that negotiations on the reintegration of Taiwan would take place in the framework of the &ldquo;one China&rdquo; policy. These negotiations would be a matter for the Government in Beijing and the elected representatives in Taipei. I hope that both sides will be able to find a way to initiate negotiations at an early date.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware our engagement with Africa informs every aspect of the Irish Government's development aid programme, and has done so for the last 25 years. All six priority countries for our development assistance lie in sub-Saharan Africa and in this current year it is worth pointing out that close to half of the entire bilateral assistance allocation will be directly expended on programmes in these countries. Regrettably, the sub-Saharan region has also been the focus of extensive Irish humanitarian and emergency assistance, most recently to Ethiopia, due to man-made and natural disasters. With the Government's commitment to reaching the UN development co-operation target of 0.7% of GNP by the end of 2007 &ndash; in effect, a four fold increase in our aid expenditure &ndash; our priority countries, and Africa in general, will benefit from significantly increased allocations from Ireland Aid in the future.</P>
      <P>In addition to increased development assistance, sub-Saharan Africa needs advocates to promote its cause in the appropriate international fora. With our commitment to the UN target for aid, Ireland can now do this to an even greater extent than previously. The fact that African states were very supportive of our successful candidacy for the UN Security Council reflects the depth of our African partnership <i>inter alia</i> and the high quality of Ireland Aid's African interventions. Our membership of the Security Council will be strongly focused on Africa and we will also continue, in this and other fora, to engage with our EU partners on issues such as extreme poverty, globalisation, the scourge of HIV-AIDS, the unacceptable debt burden and other factors which impact on the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan. We are particularly concerned about the tremendous suffering which the conflict has inflicted on the Afghan people. The conflict, which has been going on in various forms since 1979, has resulted in innumerable deaths and casualties, as well as the displacement of millions of people and the ruin of the social and economic fabric of the country. The advent to power of the Taliban in 1996 has been accompanied by the subjection of women to extreme forms of psychological and physical repression. Women have been systematically and deliberately excluded from health care and education, employment and freedom of <Col N="1403" /> movement. These restrictions have severely hampered the ability of UN agencies and NGOs to assist women and children and to implement health and education programmes. Recent reports that the Taliban has banned women from working with UN agencies and NGOs are particularly worrying.</P>
      <P>The Government condemns the discrimination against women practised by the Taliban. Through the United Nations, and together with our EU partners, we will continue to make every effort to promote dialogue between the parties in Afghanistan with a view to restoring peace to the country. As a part of this we would expect human rights and the international rule of law to be respected. The concerns of the EU about the continuing grave violations of human rights in Afghanistan, including those of women, were made known at the UN Commission on Human Rights earlier this year. These concerns are again being expressed at the current session of the UN General Assembly in New York, with the full support of Ireland. A chair's consensus text condemning human rights violations against women in Afghanistan was adopted in the UN Third Committee recently and the matter will shortly be addressed further by a UN General Assembly resolution.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners have repeatedly called on the Taliban and other Afghan factions to respect basic human rights and to prevent gender discrimination. The Union's Common Position on Afghanistan was adopted earlier this year and urges all Afghan factions to end discriminatory policies and to protect and promote the equal rights and dignity of men and women. The European Parliament has also recently passed a resolution on Afghanistan, which I welcome. The EU takes every appropriate opportunity to raise our concerns about the situation in Afghanistan, including with neighbouring countries, due to the destabilising effects on the region.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners have agreed to support aid programmes in Afghanistan which address human rights issues, including discrimination against women. Clearly, however, the full effectiveness of these can only be realised in conditions of some peace and stability. The EU is currently the main provider of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Ireland, in recent years, has provided humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan through international agencies and NGOs and our contribution this year amounted to £400,000. I wish to assure the House that the Government and the international community will continue to make every effort to ameliorate the humanitarian and human rights situation in the country, in particular in relation to discrimination against women.</P>

It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 115 states have signed the statute and, of these, 22 have ratified it.</P>
      <P>At the internal level, the preparatory commission established at the Rome Conference completed its work on elements of crimes and on rules of procedure and evidence on 30 June 2000, the target set for it by the conference. The commission continues to meet to work on the items remaining on its agenda, namely a relationship agreement between the court and the United Nations, basic principles governing a relationship agreement between the court and the host country, the crime of aggression, financial regulations and rules, and an agreement on privileges and immunities. Ireland continues to be represented at these important meetings.</P>
      <P>The Government has been advised by the Attorney General that an amendment to the Constitution is required before the State may ratify the statute. The Government has accordingly authorised the drafting of a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution and, in this regard, I have asked the Chairman of the Government Legislation Committee to arrange for the draft Bill to be given priority in the Government's current legislation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the actual ratification process itself, apart from the need to amend the Constitution, an indepth analysis of the statute by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform together with my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies <Col N="1405" /> is also necessary to determine the exact legislative and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under this very complex statute.</P>
    <P>Ireland and all other member states of the European Union have committed themselves to take whatever measures are required within their respective domestic legal systems to enable them to ratify the statute expeditiously. In addition, they have called on all States to sign and ratify the statute as a matter of priority so that its entry into force can be secured at an early date. I am not in a position at this point to state definitively how long this process might take, but I can assure the Deputies that the timely ratification and entry into force of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>Let me take the second question first. Official development assistance, or ODA, the sum of all payments, credits and transfers by the Government for the purpose of aid to developing countries, is expected to amount to £208 million in 2000. According to estimates of GNP, this is likely to equal 0.31% of GNP.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's decision in September, which was announced by the Taoiseach at the UN Millennium Summit in New York, and under which Ireland will reach 0.7% of GNP by 2007, the Government has agreed a significant increase in the aid provision for 2001.</P>
      <P>The core of ODA is Vote 39, the vote for international co-operation, which is administered by my Department. In 2000, that vote amounted to £136.4 million. In 2001, the vote will increase to £188.5 million, an increase of £52 million. Based on that increase, ODA is likely to reach £260 million, equal on current economic estimates to 0.35% of GNP, the highest rate of increase in our aid programme.</P>
      <P>The Government is further committed to reaching 0.45% of GNP for ODA in 2002, an interim target established when the Government took office three years ago. The envisaged allocation for Vote 39, designed to reach that target, is £293 million, leading to an ODA level of £365 million. Thus, between this year and 2002, a total increase in Vote 39 of £157 million is planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Turning now to the question of funding for NGOs, I reiterate what I said in the earlier reply referred to by the Deputy, namely, that Ireland Aid has an important and enduring partnership with Irish NGOs which translates into financial support across a range of interventions. Support is channelled through NGOs for the purpose of emergency humanitarian assistance in response to natural and man-made emergencies. We also assist NGOs in their work in relation to post-emergency rehabilitation and in the promotion of human rights and democratisation. We assist NGO projects with co-financing and we provide direct support by way of block grants to the major Irish NGOs, Concern, Trócaire, Goal, Christian Aid and Self-Help for Development. In 1999, assistance of £24.6 million was provided from the programme to NGOs, equal to 13.6% of total ODA for the year.</P>
    <P>Implicit in the idea of a budget line is the desire of NGOs for predictability in the level of support given to them from the Irish aid programme. Following a review of such support, plans are being developed for a multi-annual support mechanism which will deliver greater and more sustained support in the future. A decision on whether a specific budget line or Vote subhead is required to underpin this arrangement will be looked at in the context of the review of the programme ordered by the Government at the same time as the decision on increased allocations was taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is opposed to the US economic embargo imposed on Cuba. We are joined in this opposition by our European Union partners. We want to see this embargo brought to an end. We have regularly supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for the lifting of the embargo, most recently in New York on 9 November, when this year's resolution &ndash; co-sponsored by Ireland &ndash; was carried by 167 votes in favour to three against, with four abstentions. It is to be hoped that attention will be paid to the overwhelming majority voice of the General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Encouragingly, there has in fact been significant recent progress. Last month, the US Senate and House of Representatives both voted to approve measures lifting restrictions on the sale of food and medicines to Cuba, and President Clinton has now signed those measures into law. Although US financial institutions remain pro<Col N="1407" /> hibited from extending credits for sales to Cuba, this vote represents the first substantive breach in the principle of the embargo.</P>
    <P>The embargo against Cuba is, of course, a unilateral one imposed by the United States. The United Nations itself has not imposed sanctions against Cuba and, therefore, the Security Council does not have a direct role in addressing the matter. Cuba has not itself sought the Council's active involvement. The United States, as a permanent member of the Security Council, holds veto power over decisions of the Council.</P>
    <P>The framework for Irish and EU policy towards Cuba is provided by the EU Common Position which has been regularly renewed since its adoption in 1996. This aims to encourage a peaceful transition to democratic pluralism, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It makes clear that while EU member states carry on normal bilateral relations with Cuba across the standard spectrum of exchanges from trade to culture, enhanced EU co-operation with Cuba &ndash; in the form, for example, of a formal co-operation agreement of the kind obtaining with other Latin-American countries &ndash; is precluded by the non-observance in Cuba of fundamental human rights enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Such EU co-operation agreements always involve a mandatory human rights and democracy clause.</P>
    <P>However, notwithstanding the absence of an institutionalised co-operation agreement, it is notable that the EU, taken as a whole, has in recent years so developed its relations with Cuba that it is now the island's leading foreign investor, principal trade partner, premier source of tourists, and largest provider of development aid and humanitarian assistance.</P>

Ireland fully participates in the EU's continuing efforts to defuse the current crisis and achieve a return to peace negotiations. The new role of High Representative Javier Solana in the commission of inquiry, as well as the role of Special Envoy Moratinos, demonstrate the EU's commitment to mediation efforts to resolve the conflict.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, and both the Taoiseach and I reiterated this support during our statements at the UN in September. In particular, we fully support the UN Secretary General in his efforts to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and economic development. Ireland and its EU partners have sought to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost-cutting exercise but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system. We are acutely conscious of the need to strengthen the United Nations in order to fulfil the commitment made in the summit declaration to ensure a more effective instrument for pursuing the fight for peace and development and against poverty, ignorance and disease. The Millennium Summit has provided fresh impetus to the reform process.</P>
      <P>While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the re-organisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, a substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area and we will continue to work with our partners and other like-minded member states to achieve progress on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a long-standing and enthusiastic participant in UN peacekeeping. The membership of the UN now needs to give the organisation the capacity to put in place well planned and <Col N="1409" /> resourced peacekeeping operations. The excellent Brahimi Report on reform of UN peacekeeping has made a series of detailed and practical recommendations in this regard. Ireland is participating actively in discussions in New York on implementation of the report.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues facing the UN membership generally is the question of Security Council reform. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the council. It is a matter of regret that the working group has not yet been unable to report any substantive progress to the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto. Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the council as non-permanent members.</P>
    <P>A significant number of other member states strongly oppose the creation of new permanent seats on the Council and this has created difficulties for the open-ended working group. Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in seeking agreement on this issue.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary General, and in peacekeeping matters with troop contributing countries. During our forthcoming SECCO membership we will work for greater transparency and improved working methods.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can assure the House that Ireland will continue to actively engage in all aspects of the reform agenda at the United Nations.</P>

      <P>As of 31 October 2000, Ireland was owed IR£9.2 million approximately for the cost of providing Irish personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. The missions for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, UNTAET.</P>
      <P>Continuous efforts are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to recover from the United Nations the moneys owed. The Department, through the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations, makes ongoing representations to the United Nations Headquarters in this regard.</P>
      <P>The financial crisis which hinders the UN from paying outstanding moneys is a direct result of the failure by many member states, in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This situation has resulted in a serious day-to-day UN cash flow problem. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
      <P>The US is the major debtor and any improvement in its arrears situation would ease the situation considerably. The United States administration has now tabled a plan, agreed with Congress, to deal with the arrears problem which also contains proposals for reform of the UN financing system. Detailed negotiations are under way at the United Nations and Ireland, together with our EU partners, is participating constructively in the process. I had a useful meeting with the US Ambassador on this matter last week.</P>
      <P>A successful outcome to the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop contributing countries. In the meantime, I can assure the Deputy that Ireland's Permanent Mission to the UN in New York will continue to actively pursue the outstanding amounts of arrears.</P>

      <P>The implementation of the European Union code of conduct on arms exports reflects progress towards strengthened co-operation and harmonisation between member states in the field of conventional arms exports.</P>
      <P>The basis for the code was laid during Ireland's European Union Presidency in 1996 and it was adopted in 1998. The code did not go as far as we would have wished, and that was made clear at the time; however, the Union is now taking a number of steps to broaden and deepen its scope: it is now being promoted as a common standard for adoption also by third countries outside the Union who are engaged in arms exports; at the end of June a common list of military equipment to be subjected to export controls was agreed. This has already been incorporated into Irish legislation by the Control of Exports Order 2000; and work is ongoing on a list of non-military equipment to be controlled for human rights reasons, in line with criterion two of the code. The work on this list is expected to be finalised shortly.</P>
      <P>The code is subject to an ongoing process of review. An annual report based on national inputs has recently been completed. Such reports contribute to greater transparency and openness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to state once again that the overarching goal of the Government's programme of development co-operation is to reduce poverty in developing countries. All our efforts and resources are directed towards this objective utilising a number of instruments. These include direct assistance for the provision of basic needs; measures to promote economic growth, good governance and the protection of human rights; the provision of emergency, humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance, institution and human capacity building; and international advocacy for policies designed to help free poor countries and populations from poverty traps such as unsustainable indebtedness and restrictions on trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> This mix of activities responds to the diverse needs of developing countries.</P>
    <P>Our programme is delivered through a number of channels, directly via our bilateral co-operation, through multilateral organisations such as the EU, World Bank, UN and through partner NGOs and other partner organisations for smaller programmes and emergency responses.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of direct poverty related programmes and actions which Ireland Aid undertakes that directly address the poorest of the poor. Within our priority country programmes we concentrate on the very poorest areas and the programmes are specifically poverty focused and are designed in close consultation with the poor, using techniques such as participatory rural appraisal and evaluation. For example, when we invest in road infrastructure we realise that the benefits could be long-term. We therefore encourage labour based methods to ensure short-term benefits flow through local communities in the form of wages. I would encourage interested Deputies to visit some of the priority countries for themselves to see the Ireland Aid programmes on the ground.</P>
    <P>Addressing poverty means more than just attempting to ease the worst symptoms of poverty such as poor health and illiteracy. To address poverty at its core in the developing world goes far beyond the building of schools, provision of wells and many other laudable and important basic needs activities. If these interventions do not take place within an enabling environment they will be unsustainable in the medium to long term. We will find ourselves back at square one and wonder where we went wrong.</P>
    <P>Addressing poverty means tackling its structural nature and working with community, local and national authorities to put in place policies which will promote economic growth, build local capacity, reform social service delivery and most importantly enable the peoples of the poorest countries to break through the structural poverty which has enslaved them for so long. I believe that development co-operation is a structural intervention to support self-sustaining development within poor countries. Local ownership of development activities at every level is absolutely essential for success as is the forging of real partnerships to drive the development process forward. I do not pretend that this process is easy and that the results will be quickly discernible. Working in real partnership takes time and effort. Progress can be slow and the results, while positive, are not as easily measured as physical outputs such as the building of schools. This holistic approach is essential if we are to help developing countries break the cycle of poverty and the Irish programme, I can assure Deputies, is fully committed to that end.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that one of the priority countries for Irish development co-operation, namely Uganda, has in just five years reduced the number of core poor from 55% to 44% by a sustained strategy of poverty reduction pursued by <Col N="1413" /> the Government of Uganda with the support of donors. This has been achieved by a very focused approach to poverty reduction, with close attention to outputs and accountability. Uganda is still one of the poorest countries in the world and has many difficult issues to address, but it is an indication of what can be achieved if the will and resources are present and if poverty is addressed in a comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>The central importance of poverty to the Irish Government's programme of development co-operation has been recognised by our peers in the OECD. While I do not believe we have cornered the market in poverty reduction, it is gratifying to see that its central importance to our programme has been endorsed during the course of the rigorous review of our programme by the OECD last year. The review found that Ireland sets high standards for aid, demonstrates that aid can work, has an undeviating focus on poverty reduction and is a strong performer in putting partnerships into practice.</P>
    <P>I should mention that a rigorous system of evaluation is in place and my Department has its own audit and evaluation unit. In addition regular external reviews and audits take place to ensure value for money and that programmes and projects are performing to expectations and that funds are reaching the beneficiaries. As the programme grows I expect this function to grow in importance. It is essential that public moneys for the developing world are used in a way that promotes sustainable development and utilises best practice and is fully accountable by all parties to the process.</P>
    <P>As I said, all of our development assistance is designed to address the problems of the poor and to reach the poor both directly and indirectly. I believe it is doing so. A very detailed and specific breakdown of all expenditures in all categories under the aid programme is available in the Ireland Aid annual report which has been lodged in the Library. A copy of the OECD review is also available in the Library.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I meet regularly with representatives of the various political parties both on matters relating to implementation of the Agreement and on Northern Ireland issues generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach met with Prime Minister Blair last week, it was agreed that intensive discussions should now take place at all levels and with all of the parties to seek to overcome the current difficulties we face. These include secur<Col N="1414" /> ing the successful operation of the institutions, including the North/South Ministerial Council, on a fully inclusive basis, continued progress on the question of arms and a satisfactory outcome on policing. I remain confident that in these discussions we will be able to find an agreed way forward.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, in recent months we have made steady and significant progress towards securing the full implementation of the Agreement. The institutions in particular have been carrying forward important and valuable work.</P>
    <P>That is why the motion passed by the Ulster Unionist Council and the subsequent decision by David Trimble not to nominate Sinn Féin Ministers to attend meetings of the NSMC, are disappointing. As I have said elsewhere, no one party is entitled to compromise the successful operation of the institutions and to put a block on progress to resolve difficulties that lie elsewhere. While I share the desire to see arms fully and verifiably put beyond use, I do not believe that these tactics have the potential to secure that outcome.</P>
    <P>I have also said that republicans need to acknowledge that there is a deficit in unionist confidence that must be addressed if they, too, are to achieve all that the Agreement offers them. I have welcomed the successful weapons inspections that have been undertaken by the international inspectors, Marrti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa. I believe, however, that we also now need to see truly meaningful engagement taking place between the IRA and the de Chastelain commission as promised by the IRA in its statement of May.</P>
    <P>On policing, a central part of the Agreement, the British legislation which has now entered into law was improved in several important and significant respects as it passed through Westminster. However, while the Nationalist parties continue to want to see the policing project succeed, they do not yet have the necessary confidence that the new beginning in policing promised in the Agreement will be fully achieved. We need to build on the improvements that have already been made to achieve that confidence and to ensure the success of the policing project as a whole.</P>

      <P>My policy priorities for the European Council in Nice relate to four key issues &ndash; the Intergovernmental Conference, European security and defence policy, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the Intergovernmental Con<Col N="1415" /> ference, I refer Deputies to the answer I gave to Priority Questions Nos. 54 and 55.</P>
    <P>A further policy priority arising at the Nice European Council is the area of European Security and Defence Policy, on which Heads of State and Government will receive an overall report from the French Presidency. This report will cover military capabilities, including the results reached at the recent capabilities commitment conference, civilian crisis management, the establishment of the permanent political and military structures, the inclusion in the EU of certain Western European Union Petersberg Tasks functions and EU relations with third countries and with NATO. The European Council is expected to specify the agenda for continuing work under the Swedish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The draft European Charter of Fundamental Rights, approved at the informal European Council in Biarritz, will be presented to the Nice European Council. The Council will propose to the European Parliament and the Commission that, together with the Council, they should solemnly proclaim a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. The status of the charter may be raised at Nice but substantive discussions on that issue are more likely to take place at a later date. It is the Government's view that the charter should take the form of a political declaration and that a legally binding text is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Ireland is eager to see a strong positive message coming from the Nice European Council on the subject of EU enlargement. This would respond to the very real reform programmes and other efforts being undertaken by applicant countries in preparation for EU membership. It will be important for the European Council to adopt decisive conclusions on the enlargement negotiation process along the lines of the recommendations in the recent Commission strategy paper. The strategy paper includes an indicative programme of work, which would see negotiations being concluded with the most advanced applicant countries at least by mid 2002. It also suggests methods for speeding up the negotiation process.</P>
    <P>The Nice European Council will, furthermore, have the opportunity to confirm that the differentiation process agreed in Helsinki last year will continue to apply to the process of enlargement and it will be that, taken together with their state of preparedness, which will determine when the individual countries will join the EU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the fourth Euro-Mediterranean minis<Col N="1416" /> terial meeting of Foreign Ministers under the Barcelona Process which took place in Marseille on 15/16 November. I have arranged for the Presidency's formal conclusions, issued after the meeting, to be placed in the Library.</P>
      <P>The meeting began on the evening of 15 November with an opening session and working dinner devoted entirely to the situation in the Middle East. The second session on the morning of 16 November considered ways of reinvigorating the Barcelona Process, as well as a stock-taking five years after the process was launched at Barcelona. This was followed by a working lunch at which Ministers considered the state of play of the draft Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability. The final session was devoted to consideration of the social aspects of the process.</P>
      <P>As regards the situation in the Middle East, the Palestinian and the other Arab Foreign Ministers called for an immediate end to artillery and missile attacks against Palestinian communities and for Israeli forces to withdraw to their positions of 28 September. The Israeli Foreign Minister blamed the Palestinian Authority for the violence and called on President Arafat to bring it to an end. In my own interventions, I stressed the urgent need to focus on confidence building measures in order to prepare the way to a return to negotiations. The Ministers called for greater involvement of the European Union <i>vis-à-vis</i> all parties to foster dialogue and restore trust and confidence. The EU reiterated its willingness to put its efforts at the service of the parties in order to facilitate the conclusion of peace agreements and to help implement them.</P>
      <P>The Ministers considered that preparation of the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability had provided the opportunity for a deepening of political dialogue. They welcomed the work that had been done. The draft charter is based on an overall approach to stability, taking into account all of its political, economic, financial, cultural, social and human aspects. It takes the form of an evolutionary, non-legally binding, framework agreement serving as a political instrument for the gradual implementation of the principles of the Barcelona Declaration with regard to the global issues of peace and stability. The Ministers decided to defer adoption of the charter but confirmed the importance they attached to the charter, which should in the future play a positive role in tandem with the development of confidence and the strengthening of stability in the region, notably with a view to the follow up to the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting noted with great interest the proposals for revitalising the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which had been put forward by the European Commission in its communication &ldquo;Reinvigorating the Barcelona Process&rdquo;. This communication, which stressed the importance of the Marseille meeting and the intention that it should lead to fresh prospects for the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, had been presented to the General Affairs Council on 18 September 2000 <Col N="1417" /> by Commissioner Patten. At Marseilles, the EU confirmed its willingness to strengthen the Mediterranean dimension of its external relations and drew attention to the objectives of the strategy for the Mediterranean adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Feira in Portugal in June 2000.</P>
    <P>Where economic and financial matters are concerned, Ministers had a detailed discussion on developments since the Barcelona Declaration was adopted in 1995. The meeting noted that the funding available for the MEDA II Programme, which is the EU's main programme for assisting the Mediterranean partners, had been fixed at 5.35 billion for the period 2000-06. They discussed ways of simplifying and improving procedures for managing the MEDA II Programme. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the objectives of the Barcelona Declaration with the aim of establishing an area of shared prosperity and to achieving a free trade area by 2010. They noted the encouraging signs of progress towards more co-operation between the Mediterranean partners. There was general agreement on the need to speed up the process of negotiation and ratification of the remaining Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements, which Ministers saw as providing an important catalyst for economic development and also on the need for greater liberalisation of trade.</P>
    <P>A consensus was reached on the need to take greater account of the social effects of economic transition and the importance of the human dimension of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Views were exchanged on possibilities for co-operation in relevant areas, including education and training and the promotion of cultural contacts.</P>

      <P>The number of passports issued by duty officers from 1 January to 26 November 2000 was 1,075  &ndash; 195 by diplomatic duty officers and 880 by passport duty officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has long operated a system whereby a diplomatic duty officer is on call outside normal office hours to deal with matters requiring immediate attention, including the issuing of passports of restricted validity in cases of genuine emergency. Examples of such emergencies are (a) situations of substantial distress such as the deaths or funerals of relatives <Col N="1419" /> abroad, (b) urgent business abroad, particularly where Ireland is the beneficiary or (c) marriages abroad or where one of a couple going on honeymoon finds a passport to have been lost or mislaid.</P>
    <P>Since June 1999 in Dublin and April 2000 in Cork, there is an additional passport duty officer service on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sundays and public holidays, except on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. This service is intended to facilitate persons travelling at weekends or on public holidays who have either mislaid their passports or who find at the last moment that they are out of date. An additional fee of £50 is charged for this out of hours service but it is not applied to persons in genuine emergency situations as already defined. In the months April to September the passport duty officer service is also provided on Friday evenings from 6 p.m to 10 p.m. The Department's diplomatic duty officer continues to attend to applications for passports outside of these hours, but only in situations of genuine emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 18 October, Ireland is a strong supporter of the current enlargement process for strategic reasons of peace and for economic reasons. We look forward to welcoming the new member states, when they have satisfactorily completed their negotiations and have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership. Enlargement will provide important economic opportunities for new and existing member states alike. Enlargement will also give us the opportunity to address outstanding problems on our continent, including such vital issues as organised crime and a better functioning relationship with Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union. In addition, an enlarged EU can play a more important and more credible role in world affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enlargement negotiations are now at a substantive phase. The Commission assessment reports on enlargement, which were published on 8 November, are very helpful in making the necessary decisions to give a renewed impetus to <Col N="1420" /> the process. In its strategy paper the Commission proposes a &ldquo;road map&rdquo; for the negotiations, which allows the EU fulfil its commitment made at Helsinki, to be in a position to welcome new members from the end of 2002. It also allows that the present Commission and Parliament can be fully engaged in the first accession process. The best case scenario would have negotiations finalising for the most prepared applicants mid 2002. For Ireland there is nothing in the reports that should cause us problems and we will be able to firmly support conclusions along the lines suggested by the Commission in its strategy paper at the Nice European Council. It is sufficiently ambitious without lacking credibility as a path ahead.</P>
    <P>Nice will also confirm that the differentiation process agreed in Helsinki will continue to apply to the process of enlargement and it will be that, taken together with their state of preparedness, which will determine when the individual countries will join the EU.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited enormously from EU membership. We have at the same time contributed constructively to the Union's development, politically and institutionally. The decade ahead will bring its own momentous happenings, not least of which will be enlargement. These developments will influence the necessary integration process leading to the further construction of the Union. Ireland views this prospect positively. We are in favour of integration. Integration does not mean centralisation or federalisation; rather it means further developing and improving the manner in which we Europeans freely co-operate and work together, while respecting our diversity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As set out in my reply to Question No. 68 of 18 October, Ireland supports the transparent and open approach as regards access to EU information which is embodied in the Amsterdam Treaty. Restrictions on the availability of information should be kept to a necessary minimum. However, in the context of the development of European security and defence policy, there is <Col N="1421" /> also a need to ensure the protection of certain sensitive information.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Ireland was among a large majority of member states who accepted proposals made last July by the French Presidency, on the advice of Secretary General-High Representative Solana, by which public access to certain categories of EU Council secretariat documentation concerning the development of the European Union's means for military and non-military crisis management would be restricted on an interim basis.</P>
      <P>Since then, work under the French Presidency has taken place at official level and is progressing towards the adoption of more definitive arrangements for access to documents in accordance with Article 255 of the EU Treaty. Throughout these negotiations, Ireland has followed the approach which I have outlined above. I understand that the presidency is now considering whether the matter is sufficiently advanced to permit consideration by Ministers for Foreign Affairs at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 4 December.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the positions of certain member states, of certain members of the European Parliament and of legal proceedings which are currently under way before the Court of Justice. However, I would point out that the regulation is also subject to co-decision between the council and the European Parliament. In this context, I am confident that current and future negotiations will result in long-term arrangements satisfactory to all concerned.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the deadline specified by the treaty, these negotiations are scheduled to be concluded by May 2001. In the interim it is not intended at this stage that Ireland should become involved in the proceedings to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 102 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The systematic and ongoing violation of human rights in Burma is a matter of great concern to <Col N="1422" /> the Government. These concerns are fully shared by our EU partners. The continuing refusal of the military regime to address the findings of various UN and other inquiries is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The International Labour Organisation, ILO, has been carrying out a detailed examination of the practice of forced labour in Burma since 1998. They have given the military regime every opportunity to abandon this practice. In the absence of a positive response, the ILO took an unprecedented decision on 17 November, including a number of recommendations on labour practices in Burma. These recommendations are addressed to its member states as well as to its employer and worker representatives. Other recommendations relate to activities of the ILO itself, as well as to the UN Economic and Social Council. The Government, in consultation with EU partners, will examine these recommendations with a view to ensuring that they are implemented to optimum effect.</P>
    <P>The practice of forced labour is only one of many human rights violations in Burma.

      <P>I am aware of recent newspaper reports indicating that the strength of the US dollar against the euro has adversely affected the operations of Concern and other development organisations. However, it must be borne in mind that Irish budgetary commitments are denominated in Irish punts by the Oireachtas and this reality must be taken into account in budgetary planning by all of us working in an international context. In a situation of ever increasing demands for very deserving programmes, it is not possible to commit further funds to compensate for exchange rate fluctuations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the drought which continues to directly affect almost three million people in Kenya and which has caused food shortages among the population of many pastoral and marginal agricultural areas. Recurrent periods of drought over the past ten years have led to widespread depletion of grazing land and water supplies.</P>
      <P>While the drought cannot be considered to be over, the season of short rains has commenced in most areas &ndash; providing some respite for the affected population. The World Food Programme, WFP, has indicated that the immediate prospect of a famine has been averted by large scale aid interventions. At present WFP is still targeting 2.89 million people in 19 districts of the country through general food distribution. Some 659,000 people in 11 districts also received supplementary food during October. In addition, a little over one million children are targeted through the expanded school feeding programme, ESFP.</P>
      <P>Ireland's response to the drought is twofold &ndash; the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance supplemented by the continuation of small scale development assistance through NGOs. So far this year over £400,000 in humanitarian aid has been provided to Kenya through Irish NGOs, Concern and Trócaire, and the WFP to support food distribution and food security.</P>
      <P>In terms of addressing the effects of drought in the region as a whole, Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Government has provided a total of more than £5 million in humanitarian aid this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, since 1999 almost £1 million has been allocated to Kenya for projects under the NGO co-financing scheme. Under this scheme grants are provided to Irish NGOs and missionary orders for small scale development projects which meet the basic needs of the population. In Kenya the activities supported include primary health care, water and sanitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> The European Community humanitarian office, on behalf of member states, has also provided 4.4 million for emergency support to address nutritional, food security, water and health needs.</P>
    <P>It is an issue of great importance that emergency assistance is properly utilised. One way to ensure that this happens is to use tried and tested channels for funding. I am satisfied that the channels used are of a high quality with proven experience in emergency relief operations. Each of the agencies Ireland has funded has worked in Kenya for many years and their experience, together with working directly with beneficiary communities, counteracts the threat of aid diversion.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation in Kenya. Further NGO humanitarian intervention proposals have been received recently and these are being considered in light of the serious conditions in many parts of the country. We will make every appropriate effort to help ensure that, alongside the immediate humanitarian priorities, all of Ireland's aid to Kenya is as effective as possible with lasting benefit for the intended beneficiaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the application of economic sanctions and of their effectiveness in individual circumstances is one to which the Government gives very careful consideration on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Economic sanctions are one of the instruments available for the implementation of foreign policy by the international community. The most widespread support possible is desirable and while the EU can take measures on its own, economic sanctions are most usually applied by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Specifically targeted economic sanctions, when consistently enforced, can play an important role where flagrant breaches of international law occur or there is a threat to international peace.  There is, however, a strong balancing objective to ensure that the general population of the country against whose government the sanctions are enforced does not suffer. We believe that sanctions regimes should be carefully defined and focused and tailored to the particular situation to which they are to be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of Ireland's UN membership, Article 41 of the United Nations Charter empowers the Security Council to interrupt econ<Col N="1425" /> omic relations where it has determined there is a threat to international peace. Ireland stands by its obligation under Article 25 of the charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. This is binding upon all UN member states. As a member of the Council from 1 January 2001, we will have a particular responsibility both with regard to monitoring the implementation of existing sanctions and also the consideration of proposals under the charter for new measures.</P>
    <P>Sanctions have not been particularly successful in compelling countries to comply with resolutions of the UN Security Council but they have been more successful in controlling the flow of goods which have the potential for use in relation to weaponry which could be used against a country's own population or a neighbouring or other State.</P>
    <P>In the Millennium Declaration of the UN, adopted on 8 September at the conclusion of the Millennium Summit, Heads of State or Government resolved to &ldquo;minimise the adverse effects of United Nations economic sanctions on innocent populations, to subject such sanctions regimes to regular reviews and to eliminate the adverse effects of sanctions effects on third parties.&rdquo;  We will be conscious of this solemn pledge by the leaders of the world at all times when sanctions issues are before the council.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to identify how sanctions can be targeted effectively against regimes and organisations in flagrant breach of international law without causing unnecessary suffering. The Secretary-General of the UN has prioritised this issue and we will fully support his efforts.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that we are aware of the responsibility that Security Council membership gives Ireland to make a positive contribution to alleviating the burdens which are placed on innocent civilians by economic sanctions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the attention focused by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs's development sub-committee on the situation in Colombia. In discussions to prepare the EU position on the Colombian peace process, the Government expressed concerns similar to those which I understand inform the sub-committee's views. Ireland placed particular emphasis, for example, on full respect for human rights, meaningful consultation with civil society and the necessity to address the underlying causes of conflict.</P>
      <P>The conclusions adopted by the General Affairs Council on 9 October reflected those criteria as well as other valid themes advanced by NGOs and bodies such as the development sub-committee. Ministers agreed proposals for a specifically European, multi-dimensional programme of support for the peace process in Colombia, concluding that:</P>
      <P>The European Union reaffirms its political support for the peace effort initiated by President Pastrana. Together with the international community, it wishes to be of active assistance in the negotiating process which, against a background of consultation of civil society and with the agreement of all parties, should lead to peace rooted in human rights, humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms. Continuing its present efforts, the European Union will implement a substantial European programme of socio-economic and institutional support for the peace process in Colombia, aimed at promoting and protecting respect for human rights, humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms, improving the living conditions of the local populations, encouraging the cultivation of alternative crops and the protection of bio-diversity, and supporting the introduction of structural reforms in all fields that fuel armed conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concerns of the development sub-committee were further reflected in the detailed declaration made by the EU Presidency on behalf of the union at the meeting of the international peace <Col N="1427" /> process support group in Bogota on 24 October, which set out the EU view of the peace process, the criteria to govern the EU support programme, and the areas where the EU intends to focus its activities. Key points which were stressed were: there is no military solution available which could lead to lasting peace; this can only be achieved by a broadly based, overall negotiated agreement; there is no alternative therefore to the peace process; the EU condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law irrespective of who commits such abuses; the EU recognises that Colombia suffers from a culture of endemic violence the causes of which transcend the conflict caused by guerrilla movements and drug trafficking; the EU programme will consist of a continuation of already ongoing efforts and will be implemented in accordance with its own procedures; it will provide logistical or financial support to projects negotiated with the parties concerned including civil society; there will be a regular, six-monthly evaluation of the programme's implementation; and EU action will be focused on support for the rule of law, defence of human rights and international humanitarian law, the fight against the causes of violence and assistance for its victims, the protection of bio-diversity and the environment, the enhancement of regional co-operation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the declaration made particular reference to juridical co-operation in diminishing the high level of impunity from the rule of law, practical help for those who protect human rights including the peace communities, help for the millions of displaced people, alternative options for campesinos who grow illegal crops, recognition that non-selective chemical eradication of illegal crops should not negatively affect projects for alternative crop production, assistance with fundamental structural reforms for reducing inequalities and improving standards of living particularly in the countryside, recognition of the importance of preserving the richness of Colombian bio-diversity, 10% of the world total, which is endangered by deforestation and the use of chemicals in both the production of illegal drugs and in certain efforts to eradicate them, recognition too that experience in other Andean countries in the reduction of illegal crops has shown that the problem can simply be displaced from country to country, and therefore the fight against drug trafficking and organised crime can only be effective at regional and international level, including action against chemical precursors and money laundering.</P>
    <P>That is a summary of the EU position which does not, I believe, fail to reflect the valid concerns of bodies like the sub-committee on development. Earlier this month I arranged to have a copy of the full text of the EU Presidency statement at Bogota placed in the Library.</P>

      <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government stated its commitment to use all available diplomatic fora to advance nuclear disarmament, in particular by working to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime. An active dialogue is maintained on this subject in the multi-lateral disarmament fora in New York, Vienna, the Hague and Geneva, as well as with our EU partners. Reflecting our commitment to this issue, Ireland in 1998 initiated the New Agenda Coalition to work to re-invigorate the non-proliferation debate. I myself headed the Irish delegation to the Sixth Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in May last where the goals of the new agenda were adopted by the conference by consensus.</P>
      <P>On 14 September, in my intervention during the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly, I again stated Ireland's goals in this field arguing that the outcome of the review conference should be viewed as &ldquo;an opportunity to begin a root and branch elimination of these weapons&rdquo;. I pledged Ireland's commitment to work vigorously together with our new agenda partners and others to achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>This commitment has already borne fruit. In the subsequent consideration of the issue in the General Assembly extensive consultations with interested parties led to a record vote of 154 countries in favour of the resolution &lsquo;Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a New Agenda' on 20 November. Three of the five nuclear weapons states voted in favour of the resolution. The new agenda approach contained in the resolution is now accepted by the international community as the way forward to achieving the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. Therefore, in the space of two years the new agenda has become the new standard in nuclear non-proliferation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The suffering of the people of Iraq, especially children, and the problems in implementing the United Nations humanitarian programmes in Iraq continue to be of deep concern to the Government. We have held discussions with the various parties at the UN and would hope that further progress will have been made on this issue by the time that we take our seat on the Security Council in January. As a member of the council, we will be considering the situation in Iraq both in the light of developments and also in line with Government policy. Ireland stands by its obligation under the UN charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>We have consistently raised within the United Nations and the EU the urgent need to improve the conditions of the general population in Iraq. The Security Council clearly needs to take full account of the grave humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people in its further consideration of the sanctions issue. Our policy has been to advocate greater reductions in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme. The Taoiseach and I raised this issue with the US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, in Washington in March, and urged the United States, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to seek to reduce the delays on needed medicines and spare parts for infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In response to widespread international concern, the Security Council, acting under the provisions of Resolution 1284, has unconditionally removed the ceiling on the export of oil to fund the purchase of humanitarian supplies.</P>
      <P>The Council has also introduced an accelerated procedure for the approval of humanitarian supplies, in operation since the beginning of March. Under this streamlined procedure some $2 billion worth of contracts for food, education, medical, agricultural, water and sanitation sectors have been approved on a basis of notification of the Council. The Council also agreed to make a greater allocation for spare parts for the ailing Iraqi oil industry, doubling this budget to $1.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the UN Secretary General in his report to the Council of 8 September expressed concern about the negative impact on the rehabilitation of Iraqi infrastructure of holds and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> The basis for the continued imposition of UN sanctions on Iraq remains the Iraqi Government's refusal to co-operate with the UN Commissions appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction. I would call upon the Government of Iraq to comply with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 1284 also provides for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with a new disarmament supervisory commission, UNMOVIC, and full compliance with all conditions imposed by the Security Council. We would wish to see the necessary co-operation from Baghdad to allow greater progress to be made on the suspension, and ultimate lifting, of sanctions. This would be a welcome and a major step towards the return of Iraq to full participation in the international community.</P>
    <P>The Government has also addressed these humanitarian concerns directly. A £100,000 grant by Ireland Aid to the International Committee of the Red Cross was agreed last month, to address the rehabilitation of health facilities in Iraq, as well as water and sanitation facilities.</P>

      <P>Encouragement of the spread of democracy and protection of the right to self-determination are priority objectives of Irish foreign policy. We are working actively in those international fora where we are members &ndash; notably the United Nations, the EU, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe to support initiatives in support of democracy.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Ireland along with a number of other countries participated in the &ldquo;Community of Democracies&rdquo; initiative, intended to bring together the world's democracies in order to consider ways to improve international efforts aimed at strengthening democracy. This objective will be furthered by establishing a network for exchanging experiences, identifying best practices and formulating an agenda for international co-operation. The Tánaiste represented Ireland at the &ldquo;Towards a Community of Democracies&rdquo; Conference held in Warsaw in June of this year. It is not intended that the initiative should give rise to the creation of a new international body, instead it is hoped it will sustain a strong international lobby in favour of democracy. It is envisaged that further conferences will be held every three or four years and that there might also be follow-up activity at regional level.</P>
      <P>The right of peoples to self-determination is a critical prerequisite for the establishment of a culture of human rights throughout the world.

These resolutions were adopted by consensus.</P>

      <P>The aim of the round table, which took place in Brussels on 28 September, was to provide an opportunity for the European Union to consult with its developing country partners and key stakeholders on the new EU policy framework for accelerated action on major communicable diseases, HIV-AIDs, Malaria and TB. This new policy framework was adopted by the Council of Development Ministers on 10 November.</P>
      <P>At the round table, the Commission announced that it would prepare an action plan to implement the new EU policy framework. This is expected to be ready by the start of December. The action plan will be implemented jointly by the Commission services and will be based on the three key areas for intervention outlined in the new policy framework: optimising the impact of existing interventions, making key pharmaceuticals more affordable and increasing efforts in research and development especially in relation to the search for a HIV-AIDs vaccine.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been very active in pressing for an intensification of the EU's efforts to address the crisis in developing countries caused by the HIV-AIDs pandemic. A statement by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell was circulated to participants at the round table emphasising the fundamental importance of health sector development to the success of efforts to deal with communicable diseases. Following the round table, the Minister of State wrote to Commissioner Nielson pressing for early progress on the action plan. She also raised this matter with the commissioner when they met in Dublin on 23 November. We have also urged the commission to commit the necessary resources from the EU aid budget to ensure that the proposals for accelerated action to tackle HIV-AIDs and communicable diseases can be successfully implemented.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State recently announced an allocation of £4 million by Ireland Aid for HIV-AIDs programmes. We have also increased our contribution to UNAIDs from £75,000 in 1999 to £250,000 in 2000. The projects to be funded include initiatives in Zimbabwe, Lesotho and for research into a new HIV-AIDs vaccine.</P>
      <P>These allocations are based on the HIV-AIDs Strategy for Ireland Aid, launched in January, which provides a framework for intensifying Ireland Aid's response to the AIDs challenge in a coherent way across the whole aid programme. The strategy draws on a situation analysis of Ireland Aid's priority countries and best practice internationally and within Ireland Aid itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's decision to reach the UN <Col N="1433" /> Target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2007 and an interim target of 0.45% by the end of 2002 will result in a fourfold increase in the aid programme in seven years. Obviously, with such substantial additional funds, we would be able to devote considerably greater resources to the fight against HIV-AIDs and other communicable diseases which are ravaging developing countries. Work is already under way to analyse the possibilities for a greater financial involvement by Ireland Aid in the current international and national initiatives against communicable diseases, particularly HIV-AIDs. This issue will be an important element to be considered in the forthcoming review of the aid programme which will <i>inter alia</i> examine priorities for future spending in our greatly expanded aid programme.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education and Science's international section provides national co-ordination for all matters relating to Ireland's involvement in UNESCO. The Minister of Education and Science normally represents Ireland at the UNESCO General Conference, which is held in Paris every two years, and addresses the Plenary Assembly.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education and Science acts as the secretariat of the Irish National Committee for UNESCO and calls meetings of the committee. The committee usually has a plenary meeting once a year. Other meetings are called as the need arises. It met on 20 May 1999 and on 9 September 1999. The 9 September meeting was attended by representatives of my Department. I understand that the Department of Education and Science proposes to call a plenary meeting for 2000, to take place in December of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the Irish National Committee for UNESCO, from Departments other than my <Col N="1434" /> own, are Mr. John Dennehy (<i>ex officio </i>chair), Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science; Ms Anne O'Mahony, Department of Education and Science, international section; Ms Margaret Curley, Department of Education and Science, international section; Ms Frances Killeen, Department of Education and Science, international section; Mr. Kevin O'Connor, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; Mr. Eugene Keane, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; Mr. Paddy McGannon, Department of the Environment and Local Government; Mr. John Fallon, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Dr. Rosemary Boothman, Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 20 May 1999 the topics on which decisions were made by the committee were the membership of the Irish National Committee for UNESCO; Ireland's possible membership of sub-committees of UNESCO; UNESCO funds; participation programme funds; participation in UNESCO projects by Ireland; and the programme for the General Conference in Paris in 1999.</P>
    <P>At its meeting of 9 September the topics on which decisions were made by the Committee were the resolution by Luxembourg declaring the year 2000 as World Mathematical Year; Irish candidatures for a seat on the World Heritage Committee; the Minister of Education and Science's speech to the UNESCO General Conference; the provision of briefing material for the Minister for Education and Science; and the Interdisciplinary Project on the Culture of Peace.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 166 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Human rights are a priority of this Government and a central component of our foreign policy. In co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned states, the Government continually monitors the human rights situation in many <Col N="1435" /> countries throughout the world. We believe that the international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns, and that these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all Governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
    <P>This Government has commented publicly on many occasions on those situations which give rise to grave concern, in a national capacity and as a member of the EU and the Council of Europe. These concerns have also been raised on a consistent basis by this country's representatives at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. Ireland plays an active role in the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly and closely co-ordinates with EU partners in identifying priorities and strategies for human rights issues. At the recently concluded session of the Third Committee, the EU sponsored resolutions on the human rights situations in Sudan, Iran, Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all of which were adopted by vote. Ireland also co-sponsored Sweden's resolution on the human rights situation in Burma. In addition, Ireland's resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance was adopted by consensus. Ireland will also be closely concerned with human rights issues at the UN Security Council, on taking up our seat in January 2001.</P>
    <P>Concerted international pressure applied through multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe is one of the most effective means of combating human rights abuses. However, despite the efforts of the global community in international and regional fora, it has to be acknowledged that the systems in place for preventing and tackling flagrant human rights abuses do not always prove adequate. Reasons for this range from the failure of states to ratify relevant international instruments to a lack of resources and even political will to focus on these problems.</P>
    <P>Ireland is actively engaged in the discussion of specific issues with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the Human Security Network. This initiative of the Canadian and Norwegian Governments is aimed at establishing the principle of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to situations of conflict.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards. We will continue to voice our concerns, wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE and the UN Security Council on taking up our seat in January 2001.</P>

We wish to end destabilising accumulations of arms which can increase the potential for violence in areas of tension. We are actively engaged on this issue in the EU context and wherever like-minded countries share this goal, particularly at the United Nations. In the run up to the United Nations conference on illicit trafficking in small arms in all its aspects, we participate actively in several fora which are setting ambitious goals for the conference.</P>
      <P>The Security Council is concerned, in particular, with the prevention of conflict and the issue of the excessive or improper trade in arms is relevant in this context. Our approach, as a member of the council, will be informed by the policy that we are already following in this area.</P>

      <P>The total amount for Ireland's ODA in 1999 was approximately £181 million of which £113.5 million was administered by my Department. In 1999, GOAL received a total of £1,399,000 from my Department for projects undertaken in the developing world. In addition £110,000 was received by GOAL via APSO bringing the total funding from the Government to £1,509,000. This year £2,163,000 has been committed to GOAL from my Department and a further £120,000 has been received via APSO bringing the total to £2,283,000. This represents an increase of 51% on <Col N="1437" /> the 1999 allocation and is way ahead in percentage terms of the overall increase in the aid programme this year. This is a very healthy increase in funding given the many demands on the aid budget from so many deserving quarters.</P>
      <P>As I have said before I believe that in a situation of increased funding for the overall programme, the role of NGOs such as GOAL in the programme can and should be strengthened. I want to see enhanced funding being channelled through NGOs. However, I would like to see this combined with a more strategic approach to the way aid is delivered through development programmes co-financed with our NGOs and with increased focus being given to outcomes and impact. The OECD review of the Irish Government's programme of development co-operation last year noted that support through NGOs already absorbs a relatively large share of the Government's aid spending. It also pointed to the balance which needs to be struck between increases in funding and the maintenance of quality, something which I am sure the NGOs themselves would endorse.</P>

      <Quest>the input of the Government into the elaboration of the common strategy of the European Union on the Mediterranean region at the EU Council in Portugal in June 2000; if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by some development groups that the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is promoting European trading interests at the expense of developing countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Common Strategy on the Mediterranean, which builds upon the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, seeks to support the efforts of Mediterranean partners to attain the goals agreed under the Barcelona Declaration which was adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the EU member states and Mediterranean partners at the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Conference on 28 November 1995. Under the strategy, the EU will work to develop good relations in the region; improve prosperity and eliminate poverty; promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy, good governance and the rule of law; promote cultural and religious tolerance; and develop co-operation with civil society, including NGOs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland strongly supports the common strategy and together with its EU partners sees the promotion of a prosperous, democratic, stable and secure Mediterranean region as being in the best interests of the EU as well as of its Mediter<Col N="1438" /> ranean partners, and as an important aspect of EU policy.</P>
    <P>Ireland worked closely with EU partners on the elaboration of the common strategy which situates the EU's undertakings in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in an overall policy framework. In particular, we sought throughout to ensure that the strategy was coherent and comprehensive in setting out an EU vision for the region, together with areas of action and specific initiatives which would enhance existing EU relations with the countries of the region.</P>
    <P>The promotion of close and mutually beneficial relations, including trading relations, between the European Union and the countries of the Mediterranean basin is a priority for the union. The development of such trading relations with the Mediterranean countries should not impact negatively on the trading interests of other developing countries. The EU is fully committed to promoting the trade interests of developing countries at all times. Indeed the recently concluded EU-ACP Agreement &ndash; the Cotonou Agreement &ndash; provides for a significant expansion in trade between the EU and its 77 ACP partners, including many poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>

In addition, there have been 19 NSMC sectoral meetings across the various policy areas which come within the competence of the council. The one exception has been in the area of transport where the relevant DUP Minister has, thus far, refused to participate in the council. It is nonetheless our hope that it will be possible to hold an NSMC meeting in transport in the near future.</P>
      <P>In addition, the process of establishing the six all-island implementation bodies is well advanced with considerable progress having been made in the recruitment of chief executive officers, supporting staff and the setting up of office and administrative structures.</P>
      <P>By any standards this level of engagement is a considerable achievement and has been characterised by a constructive spirit of co-operation on all sides. The pattern of cross-Border endeavour over the last 12 months has constituted an intensity and spread of activity unprecedented in North-South relations.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, it is has not proved possible this month to hold the scheduled NSMC meetings in the health and education sectors, following the decision of the First Minister not to nominate the Sinn Féin Ministers who hold those portfolios to attend the council. This action is both disappointing and misconceived since compromising the successful operation of the institutions is not conducive to resolving a problem which lies elsewhere in the implementation of the agreement.</P>
      <P>However, every effort is being undertaken to ensure that the momentum in those particular areas of co-operation is not diminished. In addition, intensive efforts are being made by the two Governments, and in co-operation with the pro-agreement parties, to resolve the wider political problems with a view to ensuring that the NSMC can return to full business in the near future.</P>

      <P>These were the third general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the war there ended. <Col N="1441" /> According to reports by independent monitors on behalf of the international community, the elections were free and fair, and conducted in an atmosphere of peace and security. As to the outcome of the elections, while there is some disappointment at the continuing high level of support within their own communities for the nationalist parties in the different entities, I am encouraged by the performance of the moderate parties, particularly in the Federation, comprising the Bosniak Muslim and the Croat communities. As compared with the 1998 elections, the moderate parties have significantly improved their performance, bringing greater pluralism to the entity and State bodies.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen how far the moderate parties will be able to form alliances with one another, and that discussion will take some time. However, it is clear how important it is, at a time when events are moving ahead rapidly in Belgrade and Zagreb and the region as a whole, that a new Government in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be formed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>At the level of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the level of the federation, there is a good possibility of moderate coalitions, though the balance is fragile and much will depend upon the personalities involved.</P>
      <P>In the Republika Srpska, the Serb entity, the central question is whether a Government of moderate parties can be formed. Although the nationalist Serbian Democratic Party is the strongest party in the RS, the party leadership understands that an SDS-led Government would not be able to command international support.</P>
      <P>It is important that, in the interests of developing a stable and tolerant multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina, the incoming Government should implement the decisions of the Peace Implementation Council which its predecessor agreed in May last, in the areas of economic reform, return of refugees and displaced persons, and the strengthening of political institutions of the State.</P>

      <P>Ireland welcomes President Kostunica's acknowledgement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's European vocation. Already, significant progress has been made in integrating the newly democratic FRY into the international community through such organisations as the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Stability Pact for South <Col N="1442" /> Eastern Europe and the Council of Europe. The Zagreb Summit last week of EU and Balkan states recognised, in the context both of the democratic changes taking place in the countries of the region, and also the improving relations among them, that the way was open to all to move closer to the European Union as part of the stabilisation and association process.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the prospect of a stabilisation and association agreement has been opened up following the invitation issued by the General Affairs Council on 9 October last. An EU-FRY consultative task force will be established and the Commission will work on a feasibility study with a view to formulating a negotiating mandate for a stabilisation and association agreement. Ireland fully endorsed these decisions. While it will be some time before the FRY is ready for EU membership the perspective is there and we will be fully supportive of the efforts of President Kostunica to achieve that objective.</P>

      <P>The various Council formations, and in particular the General Affairs Council which next meets on 4 December, are involved in preparing issues for Nice. There are, of course, extensive and ongoing contacts between Irish officials and their counterparts in other EU member states and in the EU institutions dealing with all the issues on the EU's agenda, including those likely to be discussed at Nice.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of Ireland's programme of development co-operation is improving the situation of the millions of people affected by crisis, conflict and natural disasters in Africa and elsewhere in the world. Africa, where Ireland has six priority country programmes, is of particular concern where many local conflicts have spilt over into a large crisis belt spanning across the continent from Sudan in the north-east through the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes in the centre to Angola in the south-west. This is exacerbated in some regions by the effects of natural disasters such as the ongoing drought that extends from the Horn of Africa far into Asia. The humanitarian situation in other regions of the world continues to be precarious in protracted crisis areas, particularly least developed and conflict-ridden states.</P>
      <P>In view of these overall developments, it is more important than ever for the humanitarian community, including the European Union, to develop effective policies and procedures so that the available resources are spent as effectively as possible to meet the most urgent and pressing humanitarian needs.</P>
      <P>The evaluations of EU aid have highlighted the complex internal financial controls, a centralised bureaucracy, a proliferation of different funding instruments and a lack of co-ordination between different directorates in the Commission, as impeding the effective delivery of EU aid. The current institutional reform process within the European Union's institutions, therefore, provides a unique window of opportunity for the European Community humanitarian office to reposition itself within an evolving institutional context. It has already initiated internal reform as a consequence of the 1999 Communication on the Assessment and Future of Community Humanitarian Assistance. The year 2001 will be a decisive year for ECHO to introduce a number of changes in the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union foresees funding operations in approximately 60 countries and territories in 2001. The current orientations given by the <Col N="1444" /> budgetary authority &ndash; European Parliament and Council &ndash; seem to indicate that a budget of approximately 470 million could be made available for European Union funded humanitarian assistance in 2001. In case of unexpected major crises, ECHO might have to draw on the Commission emergency reserve, which is expected to be in the order of 208 million. The budget for 2000 of 480 million has been fully allocated with 460 million already spent.</P>
    <P>The EU also provides medium to long-term assistance for food security measures. The nature of these interventions is quite varied but principally involves provision of technical assistance in the development of early warning systems and more efficient forward planning. Infrastructural funds are also provided, typically the construction of roads which will aid in the more efficient delivery of food aid.</P>
    <P>Food security measures fall within the scope of the ongoing reform of the Commission's management of external assistance. We have been particularly critical of delays in the delivery of EU food aid. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell wrote to the EC Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Mr. Poul Nielson, earlier this year drawing attention to the EU's inability to react rapidly to the food crisis in Ethiopia. In addition, the Minister of State met Commissioner Nielson last Thursday, 23 November, and used the occasion to urge further reforms in the European Union's $5 billion per annum development assistance programme. Ireland together with a number of other like minded member states will continue to press for early action by the Commission to make the EU's aid programme more effective.</P>

      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the ongoing civil war in Sudan and the enormous humanitarian impact it is having on the Sudanese people. We regret the continued disregard for democratic principles, basic human rights and the rule of law evident in the country. We have raised our concerns on many occasions, both in public and privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We attach great importance to efforts to achieve a permanent ceasefire in the civil war and the negotiation of a comprehensive and lasting political settlement. Ireland is an active member of the International Partners' Forum of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development and was represented at the IGAD Summit in Khar<Col N="1445" /> toum last week. Through our participation in this and other fora, we will continue to fully support and encourage efforts to bring about progress in the peace talks, and to reaffirm the importance of a constructive dialogue aimed at developing stability and co-operation in the country itself, as well as in the wider region.</P>
    <P>Together with our EU partners, we have welcomed the steps towards normalisation of bilateral relations between Sudan and its neighbours and we look forward to further steps to enhance the prospects of peace, stability and co-operation in the region. In November 1999, the EU renewed its dialogue with the Government of Sudan. With our EU partners, we are monitoring closely progress in the national reconciliation process and internal developments, including the issue of self-determination for the people of the south.</P>
    <P>We have appealed to the warring parties to comply with the principles of international humanitarian law, particularly those relating to the safety of UN personnel, as laid down in the convention of 9 December 1994, and to free access for NGOs to civilian populations in distress. In 1999 the Irish Government contributed £1,085,000 in emergency assistance to Sudan. This funding was channelled through the International Rescue Committee, UNICEF, the International Red Cross, Oxfam, Concern and GOAL. To date this year a total of £702,032 has been allocated.</P>
    <P>The Government has been consistent in its support for the people of Sudan in recent years. This support will continue. However, we fully recognize that humanitarian assistance cannot be a substitute for an inclusive political solution. Such a solution will require full observance of the principles of democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law throughout Sudan, regardless of ethnicity, gender or religion. We will continue to raise our concerns and to offer our support for such a solution through our contacts with the Government of Sudan and other governments in the region.</P>

      <P>My attention was drawn to concerns expressed by staff members of this Department in relation to the manner in which new posts arising from Ireland's seat on the Security Council have been filled. However, I am satisfied that the decisions taken are the correct and responsible ones from the point of view of good management and that, following consultation with management in the Department, the staff associations representing the staff members involved appreciate the rationale for those decisions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the important ongoing agenda of work in my Department. This includes issues such as the enlargement of the EU, the intergovernmental conference on EU Treaty changes, disarmament, Northern Ireland, development aid etc. It is not possible to disrupt this work in mid-year by redeploying the staff members involved.</P>
      <P>Our approach to SECCO membership was two-fold, to be able to operate effectively from the start by using a number of people who had the necessary knowledge and experience and who could move seamlessly from campaign work to meet membership demands, and to minimise disruption of the ongoing work of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary for the period of membership to deploy additional staff to carry out work associated with membership. Some of these will work in New York and others in Dublin and Geneva. To meet this need, the Department reassigned a number of officers who had worked on the election campaign. We were also able to call on the services of three experienced people who had taken career breaks and were available to work in New York, Oslo and Geneva. In addition, in order to minimise disruption we have postponed <Col N="1447" /> filling two other posts abroad at the normal level until next summer when the next round of planned postings take place.</P>
    <P>The planned postings system was introduced in the mid-1980s. It was designed to allow both the Department and officers and their families adequate time and notice to plan and prepare for reassignments. The practice is that most transfers take place in the summer period. It is, of course, understood that at all times there must be a balance between the needs of the work of the Department and those of individuals affected. There will be the normal planned posting series of transfers next summer and the temporary SECCO staffing operation will not reduce the number of postings that will be on offer.</P>

      <P>On the specific issue of financial assistance for the purpose of increasing consumer awareness, an important element of the anti-inflation package approved by the Government last June was the mandate given to the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to initiate a vigorous programme of price monitoring and publicity, in order to highlight trends and patterns in prices and to encourage greater price sensitivity on the part of consumers in the interest of stimulating further competition. Additional staff and an advertising and publicity budget were made available to the Director of Consumer Affairs to mount this awareness campaign. The campaign is being carried out by the director in partnership with the CAI. In that connection, I understand from the director that, to date, she has funded the CAI to undertake four groceries price surveys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of Directive 96/82/EC, known as the SEVESO II Directive, is to deal with major accident hazards arising from the presence of dangerous substances. The Health and Safety Authority &ndash; HSA &ndash; which will be the central competent authority for SEVESO II, has informed me that this directive introduced a requirement, not present in the SEVESO I Directive, that member states should ensure that the objectives of preventing major accidents and limiting the consequences of such are taken into account in their land use policies and/or other relevant policies through controls on: siting of new establishments, modifications of existing establishments, and new developments such as transport links, locations frequented by the public and residential areas in the vicinity of existing establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, member states are required to ensure that their land-use policies take account of the long-term need to maintain appropriate distances between SEVESO establishments and residential areas, areas of public use and areas of particular natural sensitivity/interest. Also, member states are required to ensure that such establishments take any necessary additional technical measures so as not to increase the risks to people. I would emphasise, therefore, that in discussing the impact of the SEVESO II Directive on the town of Passage West in Cork, or indeed on any other part of the country, it is important to keep in mind the original purpose of the directive. This purpose is essentially to recognize that in practice <Col N="1450" /> accidents occur from time to time, and the limitation of the consequences of such accidents has to be actively addressed.</P>
    <P>Under the directive, member states are required to ensure that appropriate consultation procedures are set up between competent authorities and planning authorities so that technical advice on the risks arising from an establishment are available on a case by case basis or on a generic basis. The HSA, as the central competent authority designate, has provided advice upon request in respect of particular planning applications, such as that in Passage West. It is currently developing its advice for the district as a whole and the long-term objective is to provide advice in written and map form to the planning authorities and hence to the public.</P>
    <P>The HSA has informed me that it is not in a position to produce a complete list or a map of affected zones until the relevant legislation has been finalised and the notifications submitted by the relevant companies. Under the draft legislation establishments coming under the requirements of the SEVESO II directive will have to identify themselves to both the HSA and to the planning authorities.</P>
    <P>According to the HSA, there are different categories of risk associated with major hazards depending on the nature of dangerous substances at the establishment, the nature of the processes carried out therein and the distance between the source of risk and the person exposed. Also, in addition to risks to humans, consideration has also to be given to environmental risks.</P>
    <P>Currently there is no single agreed methodology within the European Union for the assessment of risk and member states have adopted different approaches. The HSA has informed me that while it is adopting a relatively cautionary approach due to the long-term implications of planning decisions, it bases its considerations on established methodologies developed by, or for, international bodies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency, the UK Health and Safety Executive and the Dutch Ministry of Home Affairs.</P>
    <P>The role of the HSA is to provide technical advice on the risks arising from SEVESO establishments and the level of discretion in dealing with planning applications in effected zones is, ultimately, a matter for the planning authorities to decide.</P>
    <P>I should point out that while the SEVESO II Directive has not yet been transposed into Irish law, effectively it is applicable to all EU member states since the due date for its transposition which is 3 February 1999.</P>

      <P>The impact of non-audit services provided by external auditors to audit clients, such as tax advice and consultancy, on the external audit process was one of the issues examined by the recent review group on auditing. Following from the Committee of Public Accounts DIRT report, I established this review group to examine a number of issues in relation to the regulation and operation of the auditing and accountancy profession. The report of the review group was presented to the Committee of Public Accounts on 11 July last.</P>
      <P>I am aware that when considering whether auditors should continue to be permitted to provide such non-audit services to audit clients the review group took into account international developments in relation to auditor independence. Both the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US and the EU Committee on Auditing were examining the issue of auditor independence at the same time as the review group.</P>
      <P>The review group concluded that Ireland should be at the forefront of international best practice in establishing rules governing auditor independence and made a number of detailed recommendations to safeguard against the threats posed to auditor independence by the provision of non-audit services.</P>
      <P>The SEC in the US approved its new rules concerning auditor independence on the 15 November last. The SEC's new rules, which do not impose an outright ban on auditors providing non-audit services to audit clients, are consistent with the recommendations of the review group on auditing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will shortly be bringing a package of proposals to Government to seek approval to implement the recommendations contained in the <Col N="1452" /> review group on auditing. When implementing the report's recommendations my Department will continue to take into account international developments, such as the new rules issued by the SEC in the US.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my response to a question on 17 October 2000 last, I advised the House of the need to do everything possible to reduce congestion at Dublin Port and the gridlock experienced by traffic movements to and from the port and its environs.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port is and will continue to be the premier port in the country. Throughput has risen from 6.1 million tonnes in 1989 to 15.2 million in 1999 and is forecast to reach 23.7 million tonnes by 2007. It handles by far the largest proportion of the country's unitised freight &ndash; some 71% &ndash; and has a high prospective growth over the coming seven years.</P>
      <P>As I have pointed out in a number of public fora, until the port tunnel is completed and open for business in 2004, Dublin Port will have difficulty in managing its traffic throughput. The port's own road network is to a high standard with more than adequate capacity. However, because of severe congestion in the vicinity of the port caused, to a large extent by heavy commuter traffic, port traffic is severely disrupted and delayed as it seeks to enter and leave the port. All traffic currently accesses the port through the city streets, most of it along the quays and the East Wall Road. The Dublin port tunnel will provide a direct link from the port to the M1/M50. However, in the meantime all port traffic will have to continue to access the national road network via the city's streets.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that the financial power and underlying strength of the larger ports &ndash; Dublin and Cork in particular &ndash; has already led to a concentration of volumes in these ports. An expert EU co-financed assessment of port access requirements nationally concludes that &ldquo;Dublin will increasingly face capacity constraints over the next ten years. Over the period to 2006, immediate capacity constraints will be felt in the unitised modes and ongoing expansion of facilities will be a priority. If land for expansion is unavailable, the port will have to concentrate its developments on increasing the utilisation of existing land and facilities and possibly forgoing existing lower value trades which are space intensive&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Diversion of traffic to other ports including other east coast ports must be among the alterna<Col N="1454" /> tives considered in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks limiting the flow of imports and exports so vital to the sustained growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is my policy to encourage shipping operators and the ports industry in general to maximise utilisation of capacity outside of Dublin and enhance competitiveness. In order to strengthen the contribution of east coast ports I have decided that both Dundalk and Wicklow will shortly become commercial State port companies joining Dublin and Drogheda. Together with Rosslare and Greenore this will strengthen the capacity of the east coast ports industry in servicing the central and southern shipping corridors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the joint venture between Drogheda Port Company and Norfolkline Containers-Geest Ireland Limited opening up a new weekly shipping service to Rotterdam last month with proposals to upgrade the service to bi-weekly by next February. It is estimated that some 400,000 tonnes of commercial freight will be shipped through the new route in its first years operation. This will help to reduce the pressure on Dublin Port and I am encouraging other port companies to follow this lead.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made with the research programme recommended in the Patten report and as referred to in response to Parliamentary Question No. 49 of 15 June 2000; the time schedule involved; if the Government can secure agreement from the British authorities to suspend the use of plastic baton rounds pending the outcome of the research programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government shares the widespread concerns about deaths and serious injuries which have resulted from the use of plastic baton rounds in Northern Ireland, and welcomed the recommendation in the report of the Patten Commission that a research programme be conducted to find &lsquo;acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternatives' to PBRs. The Government has consistently urged the need for stricter controls and maximum restraint to curtail the use of these bullets to the greatest possible extent with a view ultimately to their abolition.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge that the use of plastic bullets has decreased in the recent past &ndash;  in 1999, 112 plastic bullets were fired, and to date, 22 plastic bullets have been fired this year.</P>
      <P>Patten also recommended that the use of PBRs should be subject to the same procedures of deployment, use and reporting as the rest of the UK. Further, their use should be confined to the smallest number of specially trained officers and should be justified in a report to the Policing Board, copied to the Police Ombudsman. Under the Police (NI) Act, the Secretary of State may issue guidelines on the use of public order equipment by officers, and in doing so, he is required to consult the board, the Chief Constable, the Ombudsman and the Police Association, and to publish the guidance issued.</P>
      <P>We look forward to a speedy conclusion of the research programme which began during the summer, and we will consider its findings when they become known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The special session of the UN General Assembly on children is an important follow-up to the 1990 world summit for children, where 71 Heads of State and Government and other leaders signed the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and adopted a plan of action to achieve a set of precise, time-bound goals. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted in 1989, had set the foundation for these objectives. The special session will review the implementation and results of the World Declaration and will consider future action for children in the decade ahead. The special session is expected to produce a global agenda with a set of goals and plan of action devoted to ensuring three essential outcomes: The best possible start in life for all children; A good-quality basic education for all children; The opportunities for all children, especially adolescents, for meaningful participation in their communities.</P>
      <P>Ireland participated in the first preparatory committee for the special session, and will continue to follow preparations for the special session carefully. As a mark of our commitment to this important event, Minister of State O'Donnell has recently approved a contribution of IR £75,000 from Ireland Aid to the children's special session. This funding will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to facilitate the participation of representatives from the least developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> UNICEF's mission statement states that its primary goal is the protection of children's rights. It is guided by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and strives to establish children's rights as enduring ethical principles and international standards of behaviour towards children.</P>
    <P>UNICEF is one of the most highly regarded UN development agencies. Its activities in the areas of health and education of children and women fit well with Ireland Aid's priorities. Indeed, Ireland will become a board member of UNICEF in 2002. In line with our ODA policy, UNICEF has been one of the main recipients of Ireland Aid support for many years. Ireland ranks eighth among the major donors in its per capita contribution to UNICEF. This contribution is made up of Government, NGO and other sources of funding. Ireland Aid contributed IR£2 million from its multilateral funds to UNICEF in 2000.  It is hoped that this contribution will increase when a decision is taken on next year's allocation. In view of its invaluable role and experience in combating child poverty worldwide, UNICEF will remain a priority agency for Ireland Aid in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>UNICEF has given assurances that it does not advocate any particular method of family planning. UNICEF believes this to be a matter best decided by people themselves in accordance with their needs, cultural/religious values and preferences. As a matter of practice, UNICEF does not provide contraceptive supplies for family planning purposes. UNICEF co-operation in all countries is consistent with this policy and is closely monitored by UNICEF field offices.</P>
    <P>Safe motherhood and responsible parenthood are the fundamental concepts on which UNICEF formulates its programmes. These concepts have been endorsed in public debate and proven over time to be invaluable in fulfilling the unique and clearly circumscribed mandate of UNICEF &ndash; to work for the health, well-being, survival and the development of children in the developing world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Democratic elections were held in Burma in 1990. Had the results of these elections been accepted <Col N="1463" /> by the military regime and been allowed to be implemented, decades of oppressive military rule in the country would have come to an end. However, the military regime did not allow this to happen. Since then they have consistently refused to enter into dialogue with the democratically elected representatives of the Burmese people, including representatives of the National League for Democracy and the various ethnic groups. They have instead tried by a broad range of repressive measures to undermine and destroy these forces for democracy. These actions of the military regime have resulted in systematic and ongoing violations of human rights, a major downturn in the economy, wide-scale forced labour and displacement of persons, and deficiencies in the education and health systems which have had a devastating effect on the population.</P>
      <P>The problem of Burma is addressed on an ongoing basis by the EU as well as by the UN, and other international bodies such as the ILO. The UN Commission on Human Rights, the General Assembly and the International Labour Organisation have condemned the policies and practices of the military regime. Ireland supports fully all of these efforts. At the current session of the UN General Assembly, Ireland together with all EU partners co-sponsored a resolution on the situation in Burma. This set out comprehensively our concerns in respect of the many matters which need urgently to be addressed there.</P>
      <P>As the situation in Burma is considered by some countries, including permanent members of the security council, to be a purely internal one and, therefore, not appropriate for UN sanctions, the UN security council has not, and is unlikely, to address the issue. However, the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, is trying to address the situation. He appointed a special rapporteur on human rights in Burma and has tried to facilitate dialogue between the military regime and the democratic forces by the appointment of special envoys. The failure of the regime to co-operate with the UN rapporteur on human rights, led the latter to resign recently and it remains to be seen if the secretary general will make a further appointment. Mr Ismail Razali of Malaysia, the Secretary General's current special envoy has visited Burma twice since his appointment last May, but as the secretary general reported to the UN General Assembly recently, his efforts to promote dialogue have not yet proven successful. Prior to Mr. Razali's most recent visit to Burma in early October, the EU made a declaration of support for his efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Ireland's EU Presidency in 1996, the EU adopted a common position on Burma which introduced certain restrictive measures against the regime. Since then this has been kept under ongoing review and added to in the light of circumstances. The most recent strengthening of the common position took place last April and the next review will take place in April 2001. The EU has also made known to the regime and others its <Col N="1464" /> readiness to assist in promoting dialogue between the sides, but so far this offer has not been accepted.</P>
    <P>It is also my understanding that when ASEAN agreed to accept Burma as a member of that organisation, it was the intention of the other members to use their influence to persuade the Burmese military regime to change its policies. The forthcoming EU-ASEAN meeting, at which the EU will be reiterating its concerns, will provide an opportunity to assess the attitude of the membership of ASEAN.</P>
    <P>While I would hope that the military junta would engage in dialogue with the democratic representatives in Burma, the situation at present does not give any sign that this will happen shortly. It is against this background that it is my intention to keep the situation under close review and to press for adjustments in the EU common position as necessary.</P>

      <P>When President Olusegun Obasanjo was inaugurated in May last year as the first democratically-elected civilian President of Nigeria following 15 years of military rule, he faced enormous challenges, including the consequences of widespread human rights violations. EU Heads of Mission in Nigeria consider that since President Obasanjo's advent to power, the human rights situation in the country has improved. In a message marking the first anniversary of Nigeria's return to democracy, the Secretary-General of the United Nations praised the President's personal commitment to the promotion of democracy in Africa, and his work to revive the Nigerian economy and restore integrity and sound leadership to the country.</P>
      <P>We will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Nigeria. We welcome the positive initiatives taken to date, and together with our EU partners and other members of the international community we will co-operate with the elected authorities towards strengthening the rule of law, respect for human rights and good governance in Nigeria.</P>
      <P>President Obasanjo has inherited an economy in disarray which has resulted in a standard of living lower than it was at the time of independence. High levels of unemployment have exacerbated the poverty in which a large part of the population now find themselves. The Nigerian Government has taken a number of important steps to address the major problems in the economy, including in the areas of market reform, privatisation and the fight against corruption.</P>

      <P>The human rights situation in Algeria remains a serious cause of concern. We have ongoing discussions with our EU partners on this issue. As part of its dialogue, the EU has encouraged key reforms, modernisation and improvements in human rights, and has funded constructive assistance through the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. In this dialogue, Ireland has sought to maintain a strong focus on human rights and the promotion of the role of civil society. This dialogue operates under the Barcelona Declaration of November 1995, whose aim is to lead to a strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights, sustainable and balanced economic and social development, measures to combat poverty and promotion of greater understanding between cultures.</P>
      <P>We believe that Algeria's membership of the partnership can make a valuable contribution towards the ending of civil conflict in that country. Each partner country has made specific commitments under the declaration to act in accordance with the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The partnership also commits states to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. This is one of its fundamental pillars.</P>
      <P>With up to one third of the population unemployed, and one third of the population under 30, social and economic stability in Algeria is crucial and can, in time, provide the basis for a peaceful future for that country. The social and economic aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership clearly have an important part to play in this. Negotiations on an association agreement under the partnership, conducted by the Commission on behalf of the EU, resumed in April. These negotiations must, of course, be fully consistent with human rights commitments under the Barcelona Declaration.</P>
      <P>Algeria is also party to a number of human rights conventions, including the international conventions on civil and political rights, and on economic, social and cultural rights, and the convention against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It remains our concern that these commitments be fully implemented in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union welcomed the outcome of the referendum in September of last year in <Col N="1466" /> which the Algerian people endorsed President Bouteflika's vision of national peace and reconciliation. The amnesty introduced by President Bouteflika was a positive step. However, further steps are clearly necessary, and it is essential that all groups work for the security and reconciliation of the country. Most regrettably, the security situation has seriously deteriorated over recent months. These outbreaks both violate human rights and jeopardise the programme of national reconciliation and peace. The Government hope that Algeria will finally be able to emerge from the violence its people have suffered for so long. We will strongly encourage all efforts towards that end.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am satisfied that our allocations to the Irish aid programme go to the intended beneficiaries. Ireland Aid has strong oversight, accountability and monitoring and evaluation systems in place which ensure that all funds, whether spent through the bilateral programme, through multilateral agencies or through NGOs, are spent as intended and in line with the overriding aim of our programme of poverty reduction.</P>
      <P>Last year the Irish programme was reviewed by its peer donors in the OECD. That review found that Ireland sets high standards for aid; that we have demonstrated that aid can work; that we have an undeviating focus on poverty reduction; that we are a strong performer in putting partnerships into practice.</P>
      <P>This reputation for quality aid, which is at the heart of the Irish programme and implicit in which is the effectiveness of our spending, took years of patient work to build. The Government is determined, in the context of a growing programme and of its forthcoming review, to maintain and build on that hard-earned reputation.</P>

      <P>This year Ireland contributed IR £1.6 million to the general programmes of UNHCR which fund the organisation's core statutory activities: the protection and assistance of refugees; and the pursuit of durable solutions such as repatriation, resettlement and local integration. This amount rep<Col N="1467" /> resents a 22% increase on Ireland's contribution in 1999. Ireland is also a permanent member of the executive committee of UNHCR which allows us to work with this agency to enhance its effectiveness and to ensure the best interests of developing countries are considered.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government assisted UNHCR with the recent evacuation of Kosovars, of ethnic Albanian origin, from the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Some 1,031 Kosovars were evacuated to Ireland and accorded temporary protection in May and June 1999.</P>
      <P>Funding is also made available to UNHCR through the emergency humanitarian assistance fund. The amount provided fluctuates from year to year in accordance with the number of large scale emergencies which involve a high number of refugees. In 1999 a total of £1.5 million was given for Angolan, Timorese and Kosovar refugees. To date this year £200,000 has been provided to UNHCR for Timorese refugees. Further assistance to UNHCR for 2000 is currently being considered.</P>

      <P>The UN millennium summit in September adopted the target that by 2015 UN member states will have &ldquo;halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS, the scourge of malaria and other major diseases that affect humanity&rdquo;&ndash; paragraph 19, millennium summit declaration.</P>
      <P>Already, according to UNAIDS statistics, 18.8 million people around the world have died of AIDS, 3.8 million of them children. Nearly twice that many, 34.3 million, are now living with the HIV virus. The most recent UNAIDS-WHO estimates show that, in 1999 alone, 5.4 million people were newly infected with HIV &ndash; four million of those in sub-Saharan Africa alone. Altogether, there are now 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa in which more than one-tenth of the adult population aged 15-49 is infected with HIV. In seven countries, all in the southern cone of the continent, at least one adult in five is living with the virus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, these statistics show that it will be a major challenge to reach the target adopted by the UN secretary general at the millennium summit. However, the international community is undertaking a number of initiatives to address the unprecedented scale of this problem. The special UN General Assembly session on AIDs in June 2001 will act as a focus for global attention to revitalise the fight against AIDS-HIV. The European Union has recently adopted a new policy on Accelerated Action Against HIV-AIDS and <Col N="1468" /> other communicable diseases.<i></i> This complements the work already under way by UNAIDS, and the WHO through its massive effort initiative. The World Bank has also recently decided to give $500 million to addressing the spread of HIV/AIDs in poorest countries.</P>
    <P>In the case of our own development co-operation programme, the Minister of State recently announced an allocation of £4 million by Ireland Aid for HIV-AIDS programmes. We have also increased our contribution to UNAIDs from £75,000 in 1999 to £250,000 in 2000. The projects to be funded include initiatives in Zimbabwe, Lesotho and for research into a new HIV-AIDS vaccine. In the context of the Government's decision to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2007, we are also looking at the possibilities for a greater financial involvement by Ireland Aid in the current international and national initiatives against communicable diseases, particularly HIV-AIDS. This issue will be an important element to be considered in the forthcoming review of the aid programme which will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine priorities for future spending in our greatly expanded aid programme.</P>

      <P>Torture is a particularly serious violation of human rights and, as such, is strictly condemned by international law. In co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned states, the Government continually monitors human rights abuses in many countries throughout the world. As members of the EU and the Council of Europe, we have been involved in several practical and important initiatives aimed at eradicating the scourge of torture, including our membership of the European committee for the prevention of torture, which has proved itself to be an efficient and practical monitoring system.</P>
      <P>Recently, Ireland, with its EU partners, co-sponsored Denmark's resolution entitled &ldquo;torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&rdquo; at both the UN Commission on Human Rights and at the third committee of the UN General Assembly. This resolution called upon the international community to establish a global monitoring mechanism similar to that established under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is currently in the process of ratifying the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The UN convention against torture not only states that state parties will outlaw torture in their national legislation, but also <Col N="1469" /> notes that there are no exceptional circumstances which can be invoked as a justification for torture. The convention, once ratified, will provide Ireland with an effective and legal mechanism through which it can condemn torture, both within the State and internationally.</P>
    <P>Government approval is currently being sought to present a motion to the Dáil, which, once passed, will allow Ireland to lodge the instrument of ratification with the United Nations. We hope to have ratified the convention before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The Universal Declaration on Human Rights states that &ldquo;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude: slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms&rdquo;. Full adherence to the absolute values enshrined in the declaration is of paramount importance. The concept of slavery has broadened from the traditional concept of the slave trade and now includes practices such as the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. We voice our concerns, wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</P>
      <P>Efforts to eliminate contemporary forms of slavery involve a wide spectrum of international organisations, NGOs and Governments. The working group on contemporary forms of slavery, an inter-sessional working group of the sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights, is the UN body which has responsibility for the study of all aspects of slavery. At its 25th session in June 2000 in Geneva, it devoted priority attention to the question of bonded labour and debt bondage.</P>
      <P>Ireland has provided financial assistance to the UN voluntary trust fund on contemporary forms of slavery, which was established by the UN General Assembly in 1991 with the purpose of assisting NGOs dealing with contemporary forms of slavery to participate in the deliberations of the working group on contemporary forms of slavery and to provide assistance to individual victims of contemporary forms of slavery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolutions at the UN which address aspects of contemporary forms of slavery have been cosponsored by Ireland. For instance, at the <Col N="1470" /> recently concluded session of the third committee, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on traffic in women and girls, which, <i>inter alia</i>, reaffirmed that trafficking in women and girls, a contemporary form of slavery, is a serious violation of human rights. Trafficking in human beings is, of course, also a serious crime and as such the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for aspects of the issue. At a domestic level, Ireland has recently taken concrete steps to address the issue of trafficking with the enactment of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, which creates for the first time the criminal offence of trafficking.</P>
    <P>The protection and promotion of the human rights of all human beings is the first responsibility of every government. Contemporary forms of slavery, a most fundamental abuse of human rights, are being addressed in different fora and the Government is committed to supporting efforts to eliminate all forms of slavery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The large external debt of developing countries imposes a serious constraint on the development of many of the world's poorest countries, specifically the 41 heavily indebted poor countries or HIPCs. Of the 41 HIPCs, 33 are in Africa where it is estimated that 40% of government revenues are now being allocated to servicing a total debt of some US$350 billion &ndash; to the detriment of health, education and other essential social services. The fact that many of the most heavily indebted countries also have to deal with the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS adds to the need for an urgent and comprehensive response by the international community.</P>
      <P>Significant progress in tackling the debt of the poorest countries has been achieved since the G8 Summit in Cologne in 1999. The World Bank and IMF's enhanced HIPC framework has now begun to deliver debt relief. Thus far, 12 countries, Benin, Burkina Faso, Bolivia, Cameroon, Guyana, Honduras, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda, have qualified for relief under the enhanced mechanism with total committed assistance estimated at over US$19 billion. The objective is that 20 of the 41 HIPCs should have qualified by the end of 2000. When completed, it is hoped that the HIPC Initiative will deliver more than $30 billion. Taken together with traditional debt relief mechanisms, a total of about $50 billion will be provided in debt service relief to eligible countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many heavily indebted poor countries have undertaken major structural reforms to their economies in order to qualify for debt relief. Under the enhanced HIPC initiative, debt repay<Col N="1471" /> ments by these countries should, in most cases, fall to a level which is sustainable and which does not deflect scarce resources from important social sectors such as health and education. There is, however, concern that for some countries, Zambia for example, the debt relief granted under HIPC will not achieve the objective of debt sustainability and additional efforts will have to be made in such cases.</P>
    <P>Since Cologne, a number of major bilateral creditor countries have announced their willingness to write off 100% of the debts owed to them by countries qualifying for enhanced HIPC debt relief. In July 2000, the EU announced a contribution of over 1 billion &ndash; US$950 million &ndash; to debt relief efforts. The contribution is a timely and crucial step forward in a concerted international effort to remove the burden of unsustainable debt. Earlier this month, President Clinton signed legislation that provides US$435 million for debt relief.</P>
    <P>At the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Prague in September, my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, supported calls for all bilateral creditors to implement an immediate moratorium on bilateral debt repayments for the world's heavily indebted poor countries, stating that an immediate debt moratorium would free up resources for heavily indebted countries to spend on urgent social priorities and poverty reduction strategies.</P>
    <P>The enhanced HIPC initiative does not, of course, amount to total debt cancellation. Total cancellation raises a number of difficult and complex questions. Debt alleviation cannot be considered in isolation. Issues such as corruption, poor governance, internal conflict and human rights abuses must be taken into consideration. Donor governments, who will be expected to pay very substantial moneys in support of debt relief, want assurances that the financial resources liberated by debt relief are directed to the alleviation of poverty.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the important contribution which the Jubilee 2000 campaign for total debt cancellation has made to securing the current level of debt relief available to poor countries. The Government believes that it is necessary to consider every option including, where possible, debt cancellation. We continue to monitor the implementation of the HIPC process and its impact on poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>Ireland has committed IR£11 million to the World Bank HIPC trust fund, the main multilateral financial mechanism for funding debt relief. IR£4 million have been committed to the IMF's HIPC trust fund and a further IR£7 million to the fund's enhanced structural facility, ESAF. We have also provided assistance of IR£9.5 million directly to the national debt trust funds in Tanzania and Mozambique.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's recent announcement at the UN millennium summit of the Government's <Col N="1472" /> commitment to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for ODA in 2007 and an interim target of 0.45% in 2002 should enable us to devote more resources to dealing with the debt issue both bilaterally and multilaterally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly believe that one of the largest impediments to rehabilitation and development in post-conflict society is the presence of landmines. Since 1994, Ireland Aid has been involved in funding humanitarian mine clearance operations, as well as providing support for rehabilitation programmes for mine victims and mines awareness campaigns in affected countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully endorses Article 6 of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on their Destruction, December 1997, which commits each state party to provide assistance for the care, rehabilitation, social and economic reintegration of mine victims and for mine awareness programmes. The convention also commits each state party to provide assistance for mine clearance and related activities. Ireland played a leading role in the negotiation of the Ottawa convention and was among the first countries to ratify it in 1997. We continue to use our influence to advocate the importance of the Ottawa convention at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>Since 1994 Ireland has spent over £6 million on demining and rehabilitation projects. Funding has been disbursed through a variety of channels and has been specifically focused on Mozambique, Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Angola and Cambodia which have been particularly badly affected by landmines. Since that time Ireland Aid has sought to develop a long-term relationship with our NGO partners for example, Halo Trust and Handicap International. Such a long-term perspective allows our NGO partners to develop their capacity safe in the knowledge that their programmes are assured of continued support.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid's country programme in Mozambique includes a significant multi-annual programme for demining and support for mine victims. Ireland is the only donor supporting demining in Niassa Province. The annual allocation is £240,000 which covers the costs of two demining platoons per annum.  </P>
      <P>In 1999 Ireland Aid allocated a total of £1,596,101 on mine action activities. It is expected that the final expenditure for 2000 will be higher.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>I received correspondence last April on behalf of the pensioner concerned and I responded promptly.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my replies to parliamentary questions on 3 October 2000 and 19 October 2000 which give detailed information on issues relating to Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensions.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the question of pension increases, I understand that the rules of the Irish airlines &ndash; general employees &ndash; superannuation scheme do not provide for pension increases in line with pay movements. However, I understand that in line with the discretion available to them under the scheme, the trustees have provided pension increases in line with the consumer price index. The benefits from the scheme are those that have been agreed by the membership of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus are proposing in their new scheme that pensioners will be guaranteed increases in line with the annual consumer price index, CPI, <Col N="1474" /> provided that it does not exceed 5%. However, the company does not propose to provide for pension increases in line with salary movements for ongoing costs reasons and as it would also necessitate a substantial cash injection which I understand would be significantly more than £76 million as suggested by the retired staff association.</P>
    <P>In so far as Aer Rianta is concerned, a joint Aer Rianta management/staff group, working under the partnership structures in the company, has recently completed an indepth review of the pension scheme and submitted the report to management and unions on 22 September 2000. They have also held a number of meetings with the retired staff association. Aer Rianta's intention is to establish a new scheme as soon as possible in consultation with unions, staff and other concerned interests. I expect to receive a report from the chairman of Aer Rianta concerning their proposals for a new pension scheme in due course.</P>
    <P>Enhancements to the existing entitlements of pensioners must be linked to and in line with any improvements that emerge from negotiations between staff interests and the companies concerned regarding any new schemes. My Department will monitor these negotiations with particular regard to the concerns of retired staff in the context of the new schemes.</P>
    <P>While fully aware of the commercial imperatives under which Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta operate and the cost implications of pension enhancements, I nevertheless hope that the agreed terms of any new schemes will enable the pensioners concerns to be addressed as much as possible.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my response on 3 October 2000, there is no question of any subsidy being provided by the State towards the Irish airlines &ndash; general employees &ndash; superannuation scheme or the proposed new schemes to be established by either Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta.</P>

Accordingly, the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the registration details of Irish registered aircraft is held by the IAA and, as it is a matter of public record, is available for inspection, on request, from the IAA.</P>

      <P>The flight referred to by the Deputy was operated by a carrier, regulated by the Spanish authorities, for which the Irish Aviation Authority does not have responsibility. I should emphasise that Spain complies fully with international safety standards in relation to aircraft and airline company operations. From the inquiries I have made the incident appears to have involved an engine failure and proper emergency procedures were followed by the crew.  While I sympathise with the experience that passengers may undergo in an emergency, that is primarily a matter for the air carriers and authorities of the airports to which they operate.</P>
      <P>More generally, I would not hesitate to seek to have an accredited representative of the Irish air accident investigation unit become involved in any accident or incident investigation being conducted by the authorities of another state, if the circumstances so warranted. I am advised that such circumstances did not arise in this particular case.</P>

      <P>Major public transport projects, such as those outlined by the Deputy, are best considered when they are developed in line with appropriate land use planning policy and practice, so that the appropriate scale of projects is put in place to justify their capital and ongoing operating costs.</P>
      <P>I understand that rail developments in the Cork area are currently being considered by consultants who have been engaged by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council to draw up the Cork Strategic Plan, 2000-20. The consultants recently issued an interim report which, among other things, contains proposals that the area along the rail corridor from Blarney <i>via</i> Cork to Midleton be rezoned for major development which could tie in with rail development proposals, including the reopening of a commuter station at Blarney, the re-opening of the line to Midleton and the possibility of extending services to Youghal.</P>
      <P>The strategy being adopted by the consultants accords, in principle, with my position on the development of major public transport projects. However, further work needs to be done, such as detailed cost-benefit analysis, an analysis of funding options, feasibility and demand analysis.</P>

The provision of public transport for the greater Cork area for the lifetime of the plan will be an integral part of this study. The consultants recently submitted their interim report and have commenced a public consultation process on it in the Cork area. There are a number of specific public transport proposals in the report which are linked to specific land use strategies for the Cork area. The provision of a light rail system is not one of the options that is being considered at this stage.</P>

Tolls and user charges may not discriminate, directly or indirectly, on the grounds of the nationality of the haulier, or the origin or destination of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>A number of member states already impose user charges in respect of their motorway networks. The so-called Eurovignette system applies in five countries: Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</P>

However, no details of the proposed scheme were available, other than the very broad outline in the Chancellor's statement to the House of Commons.

      <P>The provision of catering facilities at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports is a matter for day to day administration by Aer Rianta subject, of course, to compliance with all relevant legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta has confirmed to me that, following a public tender process, seven year contracts were awarded for the catering and bar services at Dub<Col N="1478" /> lin Airport. The contracts were not granted on an exclusive basis as there are now a total of three competing outlets providing catering facilities at that airport.</P>
    <P>I understand that the EU competition law the Deputy has referred to applies to exclusive procurement contracts only. That law does not apply in this case as a catering franchise in Dublin Airport is not a procurement contract, nor is it exclusive. However, such contracts are subject to Irish competition law, and in a previous notification to the Competition Authority concerning a franchise agreement at Dublin Airport, the authority certified that a ten year agreement did not contravene section 4(1) of the Competition Act, 1991, which sets out the basic rules of competition.</P>

        <b>on the rights of air passengers</b>(2000/C 293/01)</P>
      <P>The Council of the European Union,</P>
      <P>Affirms its desire to make the rights of air passengers better known, and to strengthen them. In this respect, it welcomes the Commission's communication and the information campaign launched by it to make passengers aware of their rights by publishing a charter and posting it in Community airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notes that air passengers today are not sufficiently informed about their rights and are liable <Col N="1479" /> to find themselves in an unequal position <i>vis-à-vis </i>carriers.</P>
    <P>Intends to take account of developments in the air transport sector at a global level, such as alliances, franchise agreements and code-sharing, and to correct any adverse effects these may have on the situation and rights of air passengers.</P>
    <P>Believes that the liberalisation of the Community's air transport and the rapid development of air travel, which meet consumers' expectations, must also be accompanied by increased protection and better information for passengers.</P>
    <P>Recalls the provisions of Article 153 of the Treaty which aim to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection.</P>
    <P>Refers to the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council which advocate the simplification of the regulatory environment.</P>
    <P>Is aware of the special features of the air transport sector and the interdependence of the activities of the various operators involved particularly airlines, airports, travel agents and tour operators, as well as the bodies responsible for air traffic control.</P>
    <P>Intends to take care to maintain the necessary balance between measures to be taken in favour of passengers and operators' financial imperatives, which evolve against a back-ground of global competition.</P>
    <P>Recalls also that the desire to protect air passengers should not hinder the freedom of competition both inside and outside the European Union, and in particular the commercial initiatives of each company.</P>
    <P>Takes into account the work carried out and decisions taken at international level in the specialised bodies and also the work of professional bodies, such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Association of European Airlines (AEA) and WILL ENSURE that steps taken by it are consistent with international conventions, particularly those of Warsaw and Montreal, and with the work of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC).</P>
    <P>Desires that consideration also be given to an initiative to protect the rights of passengers in the case of other modes of transport.</P>
    <P>Considers that priority actions should seek to:</P>
    <P>1.improve the information given to air passengers through:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> (a)clarification of contracts, which must be made more accessible and easier to understand, and must spell out the essential details;</P>
    <P>(b)prompt and precise information on delays and, more generally, on any unexpected problems occurring during the journey;</P>
    <P>(c)the drawing up, at European level, of regular reports enabling consumers to compare air carriers' performances;</P>
    <P>2.strengthen the protection of air passengers' rights: in this area, certain contractual terms need to be revised in the light of Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts; in addition, the issues of ticket transfer. confirmation of reservations, price changes after booking, possible compensation and, <i>inter alia</i>, ticket reimbursement in the event of delays should be considered;</P>
    <P>3.improve the service provided, particularly;</P>
    <P>(a)in the event of delays, by considering, for example, the scope for re-routeing passengers as soon as possible and providing them with a minimum level of assistance;</P>
    <P>(b)in order to take into account the needs of passengers with disabilities and those requiring specific assistance;</P>
    <P>(c)in the event of luggage being lost, delayed or damaged;</P>
    <P>4.finally, facilitate the handling of disputes: it is indispensable in this area that airlines, airports, travel agencies and tour operators should make it easier to file complaints, and that these should be processed within a set period; it is also necessary that mechanisms should be put in place for the settlement of disputes, particularly on the basis of the Council Resolution of 25 May 2000 on a Community-wide network of national bodies for the extra-judicial settlement of consumer disputes.</P>
    <P>Urges those involved to undertake and continue with voluntary measures concerning the actions listed by the Council. Voluntary commitments will need to be sufficiently specific to allow for a real improvement in the situation of the air passenger and will need to allow for their implementation to be monitored. These measures should be taken with a desire for efficiency; for this reason, they should be taken quickly and completed no later than May 2001 with a view to the European Union/European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) dialogue meeting on this sub<Col N="1481" /> ject, and reports on their progress should be drawn up regularly by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Emphasises that in the event of failure of the process of voluntary cooperation which it favours, it may prove desirable to contemplate legislative initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>Notes that the Commission intends to submit legislative proposals. At this stage, the Council believes that priority should be given to addressing the subject of the air transport contract in order to set its minimum requirements, and to publishing regular reports for consumers, and intends to consult interested parties on the matter.</P>
    <P>Shares with the Commission the need to reinforce the current protection of passengers in the event of a refusal of boarding.</P>
    <P>Instructs Coreper to consider forthwith the Commission proposals on amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97 of 9 October 1997 on air carrier liability in the event of accidents and on approving the Convention for the unification of certain rules for international carriage by air (Montreal Convention).</P>
    <P>Confirms it intention of discussing this matter again at its next meeting.</P>

Grant assistance will represent 50% of the total cost of the remediation work, subject to a maximum grant of £800 per household.</P>
      <P>The specific details of the scheme will be settled by a steering committee comprising my Department, the Departments of Finance and Environment and Local Government and the RPII.

      <P>The Public Transport Partnership Forum met for the first time on 9 June last. The forum is chaired by Department of Public Enterprise and consists of representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and the Environment and Local Government, as well as various representatives of the social partners and CIE. The forum has met on a monthly basis so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the forum are essentially as set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, that is, to provide a mechanism for consultation on public transport matters, particularly: the development of overall public transport pol<Col N="1484" /> icy; strategies for the development of the public transport system; public transport investment requirements, priorities and programmes and mechanisms for the improved delivery of public transport services, infrastructure and facilities.</P>
    <P>The forum will continue over the coming months, as part of its work programme, to discuss major issues arising in the public transport sector. To date, issues considered include: the Government's consultative paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport; institutional arrangements for transport and land use in the greater Dublin area; the contribution of public transport to balanced regional development, including rural public transport; implementation of the public transport programme under the national development plan; and an integrated transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The forum agreed at its meeting on 7 September 2000 to establish a sub-group to look specifically at the issue of rural public transport. The agreed terms of reference for the sub-committee are to prepare, for consideration by the forum, draft recommendations to the Minister for Public Enterprise in relation to: pilot public transport schemes as set out under the national development plan; and policy on rural public transport.</P>
    <P>The subgroup is expected to report to the plenary session of the forum by mid-2001. The forum also decided at its meeting on 5 October 2000 to commission independent consultants to carry out a comparative evaluation of the various approaches to the provision, regulation and integration of public transport services in major urban areas. The process of procuring consultants is currently under way.  The purpose of the study is to assist the forum in making a formal statement of its views to the Government in response to the consultation paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport. A report on the completed study is to be submitted to the forum within four months of commencement.</P>
    <P>The forum has also recently agreed a statement on the future institutional arrangements for transport and land use in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, the forum has agreed to discuss the following issues over the coming months: rail development outside the greater Dublin area and the development of rail freight services; urban land-use and transportation studies; and regulation of the bus market outside the greater Dublin area.</P>

      <P>The purchase of crash rescue equipment, including fire tenders, has been delegated to the military authorities since 1998.</P>
      <P>When the issue of a fire tender for Finner Camp, County Donegal, was first brought to my attention in May last, I immediately instructed the military authorities to initiate the tender process to acquire the fire tender. I understand that the new fire tender is scheduled for delivery next March. In the interim, appropriate personnel in Finner Camp will receive suitable training so that the fire tender can become operational on delivery.</P>
      <P>I further understand that the question of what interim arrangements should be made in the context of ensuring proper safety is under consideration by the military authorities.</P>
      <P>At a meeting in early October 2000 I impressed on the military authorities, including the general officer commanding the Air Corps, that safety standards in both equipment and facilities are of paramount importance. I pointed out that funding is not an issue where safety is concerned. Funding is, and will continue to be, available to improve and modernise safety equipment. Safety standards are under continuous review by the military authorities. Any recommendations made on safety issues in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will be implemented without delay.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted two applications for special beef premiums in 1999 on a total of 40 animals. He submitted a suckler cow application for four animals and a ewe premium application for 30 ewes. Total number of livestock units applied on was 40.9 livestock units. His area aid declaration was for 28.49 hectares. This resulted in a stocking density calculation of 1.43 livestock units per hectare. Extensification premium is payable only to applicants whose stocking density is less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare.</P>
      <P>The second special beef premium application was submitted to the special beef premium unit on 21 December 1999. In July 2000 the applicant requested that this application be included as part of the 2000 scheme in order to reduce the stocking density and qualify for 1999 extensification premium. Under EU regulations, it is not permissible to withdraw a special beef premium application and have it deferred to a new scheme year. The person named has requested the withdrawal of the December application on two occasions and correspondence was sent to him on 10 July and 10 October 2000.

      <P>An over-claim has been identified on one of the land parcels claimed by the person named in 2000. Maps were issued to the person named and she was informed of the <Col N="1492" /> extent of this overclaim. The applicant agreed that the boundary of the land parcel, as digitised and validated by my Department, was correct and the difference between the amount claimed and the gross area of the land parcel was 2.07 hectares. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, as the difference was between 3% and 20% of the correct area, a penalty of twice the difference was applied. The total forage area has, therefore, been reduced from 31.23 hectares to 25.02 hectares and the 2000 area aid application has been processed on this basis. Payment of her entitlements under the 2000 cattle headage scheme and the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme will issue within the next seven days. Payments will be calculated on the basis of 25.02 hectares.</P>
      <P> The person named was paid her full entitlement under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme. The 60% advance of £798.84 issued on 20 December 1999 and the balance of £532.56 issued to her on 7 February 2000. The amount of £70.90 under the 1999 euro-compensation on suckler cows issued to her on 20 December 1999.</P>
      <P> Submission of an area aid application is a condition of eligibility under the headage schemes. While the person named applied on 18 animals under the 1999 cattle headage scheme she did not submit a 1999 area aid application. Consequently, in accordance with clause 22 of the terms and conditions of the 1999 cattle headage scheme, no payment can issue to her under this scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will sympathetically review the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny where an overpayment is being recovered under the early retirement scheme and where the person was genuinely not aware that she should have notified his Department of her social welfare payments as she felt she was entitled to both pensions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person named entered the scheme of early retirement from farming in joint management with her husband. The regulation under which the scheme was introduced requires that in such cases the pension payable under the scheme must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension which becomes payable. Participants in the scheme, or their partners in joint management arrangements such as this, are required to notify my Department when they become entitled to a national retirement pension so as to ensure that the national pension can be offset promptly against the early retirement pension, thus preventing overpayments.</P>
      <P>The person named qualified for a national retirement pension from 29 May 1998 but she did not inform my Department, which became aware of it only in September 2000. By that stage a substantial overpayment had arisen. My Department, to comply with its obligations in respect of EU funds, has no option but to recover the overpayment in full. Withholding the balance of her early retirement pension would not be enough to offset the whole overpayment, so there is a balance which must be recovered directly from the person named. My Department wrote to her on 7 November 2000 setting out the position and outlining options for repayment of the amount overpaid. My Department will consider sympathetically any proposals she herself may wish to make which will in due course result in full repayment.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current difficulties in the beef market stem from a serious reduction in consumer confidence in some of our major markets as a result of certain events in France. This, in turn, has led to a sharp drop in consumption in France and some other member states and, accordingly, a contraction of market outlets for Irish beef.</P>
      <P>The impact of all these developments can be seen clearly from the fall in cattle prices in recent weeks and, particularly, cow prices. I should emphasise that the high volume markets have remained open and that some practical problems which were encountered in Russia have been resolved.</P>
      <P>I believe that the problem needs to be tackled on two fronts. First, we need to restore consumer confidence in beef. Second, we need to ensure that appropriate market support measures are put in place in order to alleviate impact on producers. On the first point, I believe that the decisions taken in the Council and in the standing veterinary committee last week in relation to increased testing of cattle for BSE should make a considerable contribution to the achievement of that objective. In summary, it has been agreed that &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; animals over 30 months old will be tested for BSE from 1 January 2001. This testing may be extended to animals over 30 months from 1 July 2001. Further measures are also being taken in relation to the prohibition on the use of fallen animals in animal feed. I strongly welcome these decisions and I believe that they will help, first, to ensure greater consumer protection and, secondly, to restore consumer confidence. Increased testing is essential and it is my firm intention to move ahead with this in advance of the EU timetable. The successful Council meeting was the critical first step in bringing calm and equilibrium back to the situation.</P>
      <P>As far as measures are concerned, I made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler in the Council last week for effective measures to support the market to address these problems. I am pleased that the Commissioner has responded swiftly to my request and increased export refunds with effect from last Saturday by 15% in the case of male live cattle and beef and by 130% in the case of female beef. These changes are worth 5p a lb in the case of male beef and 9p a lb in the case of female beef and should significantly improve the competitiveness of our exporters on third country markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission has also introduced a private storage scheme for cow beef with effect from 29 November. The scheme, which will run until 2 <Col N="1498" /> February 2001, will provide for an EU contribution to the storage of cow beef for a minimum three month period at a rate of 17p a lb, with provision for a further storage period up to three months at a rate of aid of 73p per tonne per day. I have urged the beef processing sector to make maximum use of the scheme so that its full benefits will be available to Irish farmers who wish to sell cows over the coming months.</P>
    <P>My Department, our embassies abroad and Bord Bia have been very active in recent weeks in re-assuring our customers in our major markets about the safety of Irish beef, the limited incidence of the disease in Ireland and the controls which have been put in place over the years to ensure maximum protection of the consumer. My Department will continue to give reassurances where ever they are required.</P>
    <P> Compensation is provided by the EU to farmers arising from the introduction of the Euro. It is also open to member states to match that amount. I have decided to exercise this option. The compensation package will result in the payment of an additional £14.3 million to Irish beef producers early next year, subject to clearance by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>The measures taken at EU level are very positive developments and should restore confidence in the market at producer and exporter level and help to alleviate the impact of the current difficulties on Irish cattle producers. I will keep the situation under review over the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in its Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997, the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates of those deals, but with a guaranteed minimum increase of 3% or 2% in the case of any pensioners who had already received an advance payment of 1%. All subsequent relevant pay increases have been passed on to pensioners on the basis of parity, including the special pay increase of 2% under the Partnership 2000 Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of pension increases generally was considered by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. I have recently received the final report of the commission from the chairperson. I will be bringing the report to Government within the <Col N="1499" /> next few weeks and I intend to arrange for its publication and launch in January 2001. I will be considering future pensions increases policy in the context of the recommendations in that report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the specific impacts on individual areas of the country from changes in weather patterns arising from global warming have not been definitively established, it is generally reasonable to assume that increases in sustained rainfall events will potentially lead to more frequent and/or extensive inundation of existing flood prone areas and put additional marginal areas at risk of flooding. Pending the definitive assessment of the impacts of climate change, it is not practicable to develop general flood control plans in the absence of specific problems. The Office of Public Works, in the preparation of individual flood relief schemes, currently take into account some increases in flooding levels.</P>
      <P>I intend to reconvene the interdepartmental committee constituted by my predecessor in 1996 to examine the effects of bad weather. As part of the review of the recent bad weather and consequential flooding, I will ask the committee to consider the question of flood risk mapping. This is a complex task but I believe, when completed, it would give valuable assistance to local authorities, particularly when preparing development plans and considering planning applications.</P>

      <P> The existing working group on benefit-in-kind tax on car parking was expanded to include the director of traffic of Dublin Corporation, representatives of the Dublin Transportation Office and officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the context for the recent taxation measures on housing, which I introduced in the Finance (No 2) Act, 2000, is the difficult housing market situation at a national level. These market conditions, which are fully elaborated on in the most recent study into the housing market by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, economic consultants, required prompt action. In particular there was a pressing need to strengthen the position of first time owner-occupier buyers compared to investors. The third Bacon report pointed to speculative demand which was helping to drive <Col N="1501" /> up housing prices. The restructuring of the stamp duty regime is one of the measures designed to help first time owner-occupier buyers. Given the constraints on resources in the building sector at present, there is also need to focus more on provision for people who need homes which they will live in throughout the year.</P>
      <P>A flat 9% stamp duty rate will now be charged on all categories of investors buying new or second hand residential property. The Government decided to apply this rate of 9% to all non owner-occupier purchasers of new and second hand residential property, irrespective of the value of the property, as it was considered that the previous graduated scale of rates might encourage investments in the lower end of the market. This would not be a desirable development from the point of view of the first time owner-occupier purchaser as it would bring further pressure on prices at the lower end of the market.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty is applied on a once-off basis only. It is applied on a &lsquo;class' basis to a range of items, for example to purchases of Irish shares, to mortgages, to insurance policies as well as to property and is, therefore, not a taxation that readily lends itself to exemptions on a regional basis. Any attempt to introduce such an exemption would raise equity considerations concerning the tax treatment of individuals in different areas. There is also a serious risk that such an exemption could lead to distortions in the housing market. These could hinder the overall national goal of increasing the supply of new homes, especially to meet the needs of first-time buyers who are trying to get a foothold in the housing market. The tax incentives applying to designated properties under the rural renewal scheme far outweigh the once-off charge to stamp duty arising on the purchase of an investment property under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I consider that the latest package of measures, including the new stamp duty regime, should assist in restoring balance in the market and curbing price-increases. This price moderation is in the interests of all in the property sector whether first time buyer, owner occupier or investor.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that the Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for devising and implementing flood relief measures according to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, he will give the reason the Office of Public Works did nothing to prevent flooding at Lucan, County Dublin after the River Griffeen burst its banks in 1993 and, further to Parliamentary Question No. 224 of 21 November 2000, the proposals he has following the worst ever recent flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to divide and implement drainage works are derived from the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which empowers the Office of Public Works to carry out drainage works by way of comprehensive arterial drainage schemes for entire river catchment areas and the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, which also gives the additional powers necessary to carry out drainage works for the alleviation of localised flooding problems in areas. The local authorities also have functions in relation to the alleviation of flooding within their jurisdictional areas under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.</P>
      <P>At the time that the River Griffeen, which is situated in the Liffey River catchment, burst its banks in 1993, the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works were derived from the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which related to implementation of comprehensive arterial drainage schemes for entire river catchment areas only. Accordingly, the commissioners were statutorily precluded from dealing on a piecemeal basis with individual flooding problems on the River Griffeen ahead of a comprehensive scheme for the entire Liffey catchment.</P>

      <P>Negotiations to secure European Commission approval for the business elements of the town renewal scheme are continuing and it will take some more months before this approval is received. As is the case with similar tax incentive schemes aimed at area renewal, the relief can only be claimed in respect of eligible expenditure incurred during the scheme's qualifying period. This qualifying period for the tax relief for the business elements of the scheme can accordingly only commence when a ministerial order is made <Col N="1503" /> after the European Commission approval is obtained. In no circumstances can expenditure incurred on commercial property prior to the approval date be considered eligible for relief under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The personal assistance service is part of a range of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities designed to enable them to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence.

    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, this Government has provided a total of £72.56 million additional funding for the maintenance and development of services in the sector, including capital developments. This year £7 million development funding has been allocated for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, rising to £14 million in the year 2001. This funding will be primarily targeted at the provision of additional day care places and home support services.

    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility. The current maximum rate of mobility allowance is £45.60 per month.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will wish to know that this allowance, among others, is being considered in the context of the following interdepartmental working groups: The review group which is examining the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and the working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which is examining the feasibility of introducing a &ldquo;cost of disability&rdquo; payment, chaired by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 and 278 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the provision of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and their families in the Waterford region is the responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Between 1993 and 1999, St. Joseph's special school received three days speech and language therapy per week. One speech and language therapist who was providing two of the three sessions in St. Joseph's left the board's services in 1999, which resulted in the service to St. Joseph's being reduced to one day per week. The board is encountering serious difficulties in recruiting a replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has informed me that its speech and language therapy services are under staffed by 50%. Four therapists have left the services since June 1999. New posts have also been created and it has not yet been possible to fill these, with the <Col N="1508" /> result that there are currently a number of vacant posts. One new member of staff was recruited in October 2000 as a result of a college sponsorship programme. The board is continuing to pursue this avenue of recruitment.</P>
    <P>The board has expressed its regret that many categories of clients cannot access the desired level of service due to this situation, but has assured me that these difficulties are not the result of a lack of commitment to the filling of these posts. As soon as additional therapists are recruited by the board, every effort will be made to resume the original three-day service to the children in St. Joseph's.</P>
    <P>My Department, while acknowledging the various initiatives which have been and continue to be undertaken to recruit various categories of staff, has asked the health boards/Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore all measures to ensure that as many children as possible have access to the therapy services. I am also working with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority to increase the number of training places available for the various allied health professionals, including speech and language therapists as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department has engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including speech and language therapists. The report is expected by the end of the year and will address the number of additional training places required for these professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, progress has been made in increasing the number of training places for <Col N="1509" /> speech and language therapists and an additional eight places have been made available by the colleges for the October 2000 intake of students.</P>
    <P>I am committed to taking all appropriate steps to promote the recruitment and retention of health services staff, including speech and language therapists. When the workforce planning study is to hand I will be considering all possible options to encourage qualified speech and language therapists to work in the Irish system, including those working abroad.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December, 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including the development of services for visually impaired adults and children. As also recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services in their functional area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> Since the report was published, additional on-going revenue funding totalling £17 million has been provided to the health boards for priority service developments for people with physical and sensory disabilities. From the £10 million additional ongoing revenue funding provided between 1997 and 1999, a total of £1.051 million has been invested in the development of services for people with sensory disabilities, including children with visual impairments.</P>
    <P>I have also recently received a copy of the report of the planning group for a national centre for children with visual impairment. The group's report puts forward a comprehensive range of very significant proposals and these are currently being considered in my Department.

      <P>The chief medical officer has commented on the contents of the report prepared in the UK on mobile phones and health but did not recommend that any specific additional measures needed to be taken here. It was noted that despite public concern about safety the recent advent of these instruments on a wide scale has meant that if there are any long-term health effects there has been little opportunity for these effects to manifest themselves. The report on balance is of the opinion that the available evidence suggests that <Col N="1514" /> exposure to this type of radiation below internationally accepted guidelines does not cause adverse health effects to the general population but cannot be absolutely definitive about this. While certain biological effects may occur below the above mentioned levels they are not indicative of any long-term adverse health effects. Nevertheless this does give rise to some concerns.</P>
      <P>The report suggests that there are some gaps in knowledge which need to be filled by authoritative research and that a prudent approach to the use of technologies be adopted until further research is completed and evaluated. Licensed mobile phone companies operating here are required to comply with emission levels set by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection &ndash; ICNIRP. Compliance with these emission levels is monitored by the telecommunications regulator who publish an annual audit report.</P>

    <P>The following is the number of nurses, employed by health boards, by category, as recorded in the health service personnel census, for the years 1994 to 1999. It is important to note that certain grade categories were amalgamated or classified under different headings over the period in question. These factors explain the absence of data for certain categories of nursing staff for individual years. Nursing students participating in the nursing registration/diploma programmes are supernumerary to service requirements and are not part of the rostered workforce. Therefore, they have been excluded from the census.</P>

    <P>The following is the number of management/administrative staff, employed by health boards, as recorded in the health service personnel census, for the years 1994 to 1999. The grade category of management/administrative also includes staff who are of direct service to patients, such as consultants' secretaries, community welfare officers, out-patient department personnel, ward clerks, medical records personnel and telephonists who are engaged in front line duties.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the purpose of many of the additional staff classified as management/administrative is to support front <Col N="1526" /> line professionals in carrying out their duties more efficiently. Health professionals, especially consultants and nurse managers, require clerical support and request such appointments on an ongoing basis. The strengthening of the accountability of health boards in the context of the accountability legislation of 1996 has led to the strengthening of finance departments also. In addition, improvements in risk management, human resource management and health and safety practices have contributed to a growth in the management/administrative area. The growth in the numbers at management/administrative level must be taken in this context.</P>

      <P>I am confident that the overall standard of food in Irish hospitals is satisfactory and that the issue of food standards in public hospitals is taken very seriously by hospital management. Both hospital management and staff exercise extreme vigilance and strive to maintain a high standard of food quality in their hospitals. Hospitals employ appropriately qualified and trained catering staff who are responsible for all meals provided. The major capital developments which have taken place in recent years on the design and re-development of many public hospitals have included modifications to kitchen and catering facilities which have been up-graded to the highest specifications. Where necessary, special nutrition and dietary requirements for patients are arranged by nutritionists and-or dieticians employed in hospitals who work in consultation with medical and nursing staff.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which existing tribunals or past tribunals of compensation such as the blood products tribunal, handled the issues of legal representation of claimants, arrangements for appeal where the level of award is disputed, and right of application for compensation by next of kin of a deceased person; if caps were placed either on individual awards or the total value of awards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the hepatitis C compensation tribunal which was established on a statutory basis under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997. This Act provides that the following persons may claim compensation: a person who has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C arising from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D; a person who has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or a blood product within the State, a person in certain circumstances who is responsible for the care of a person in the above categories; and any dependant of a person who has died as a result of having contracted hepatitis C or where hepatitis C was a significant contributory factor to the cause of death.</P>
      <P>As regards the level of compensation awarded by the compensation tribunal, section 5 (1) of the 1997 Act provides that an award of the tribunal to a claimant is to be made on the same basis as an award of the high court calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort and any relevant statutory provisions. Section 11 provides for the payment of an additional 20% in lieu of the tribunal assessing and awarding aggravated or exemplary damages. The Act also provides for an appeal by the claimant to the high court against the award of the compensation tribunal. Section 5 (5) of the Act provides for the award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the claimant in taking her/his claim to the tribunal and may include legal, medical and other professional costs and expenses. Costs are also awarded in high court appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the dissolution of the national rehabilitation board responsibility for the provision of audiology services is being transferred to ERHA and the regional health boards. Because this transfer could not be accomplished all at once it was decided to transfer initial responsibility for the services, including technical services, to the northern area health board.</P>
      <P>I understand from the northern area health board that the number of centres in the South Eastern Health Board in which clinics are currently run is eight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the transfer of the audiology services to the northern area health board on 10 June, 2000 the total amount of administrative support in the South Eastern Health Board amounted to 0.6 of a post, distributed between the four offices in that board's area. In July, the allocation was <Col N="1533" /> increased to 0.5 of a post in each of the four locations. This allocation was further increased by 0.5 of a post in October giving a total of 2.5 posts, a five-fold increase. The board is monitoring the situation and will endeavour to further increase administrative support if the need arises.</P>
    <P>Given that the South Eastern Health Board area is served by one audiological scientist, outlying hearing clinics are generally held every two months. Following a particular clinic, reports are then sent as required to teachers for the deaf as expeditiously as the administrative process allows. It takes approximately three months from the time of assessment to the time of reporting which under the present arrangement is quite reasonable.</P>
    <P>The northern area health board is currently engaged in a full review of the service including making better use of new technology, procuring new equipment for clinicians and attempting to reduce the number of people who do not attend scheduled interviews. The board is also doing a national audit of staffing requirements with a view to improving staff ratios. It is anticipated that these initiatives will significantly enhance the service.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental treatment services to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</P>
      <P>Health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care. Children in certain classes, usually in second, fourth and sixth classes are dentally screened and follow up treatment is provided as necessary. Children who have attended national school retain eligibility up to their sixteenth birthday and treatment is provided within the resources available to the boards through an extension of the targeted approach. As the delivery of services to children is not demand led, patient waiting lists do not arise.</P>
      <P>Services to eligible adults, that is, those with medical cards, are provided by private practitioners under the dental treatment services scheme. Patients receive treatment on demand for a range of treatment items. Prior approval is required for a small range of treatment items and this is usually conveyed within 30 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies in the House of 14 November and 22 November 2000 in relation to the initiatives which have been taken at national level and in each health board in relation to intercountry adoption assessment. I am also making a copy of the report of the group charged with implementing the recommendations of the report Towards a <Col N="1538" /> Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the projected waiting time for assessment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, area at the end of September 2000 was 24 to 36 months. This had reduced since the end of June 2000. The ERHA anticipates that it will be able to reduce this waiting time further with the full introduction of the standardised framework for intercountry adoption. In addition, the number of social workers, whole time equivalent, carrying out assessments has increased from eight and a half to ten during this period and the board are currently pursuing an overseas recruitment drive. I am satisfied that the initiatives already taken have brought about improvements and that this trend will continue.</P>
      <P>Under the existing legislation adoption assessments may be carried out by health boards and adoption societies registered with the Adoption Board. Any society may apply to the Adoption Board for registration under the Adoption Act, 1952, section 34 to 39, as amended, which prescribe the criteria to be met for registration. One such society is currently carrying out assessments for intercountry adoption and the ERHA has also arranged to fund this adoption society to carry out a small number of assessments on its behalf.</P>
      <P>The accreditation of competent bodies, for example, adoption agencies-societies, to undertake certain tasks such as assessment for intercountry adoption will be considered in the context of the proposed legislation to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption.</P>

      <P>The price of drugs and medicines, ex-manufacture, in Ireland has been subject to control since <Col N="1539" /> 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association &ndash;  formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries &ndash; which provides that the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. Accordingly, Irish prices for the ingredient cost of prescription medicines are generally in line with prices in the UK. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products.</P>
      <P>Some discrepancies exist between the prices of individual products in Ireland and the UK, particularly in the generic market. These are due in large measure to a vibrant generic market in the UK where the overall market is much larger and where there is significant competition that affects prices charged for generic medicines.</P>

      <P>Day care centres encompass various health care programmes in the non-acute hospital sector such as those relating to disability services, services for older persons, child and family support services, etc. Health boards have primary responsibility for the prioritisation of capital funding provided to them. A significant increase is being provided under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, and this corresponds to approximately a trebling of investment over the previous seven year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the current year, it should be noted that capital funding provided under the NDP operates on an annual cash management basis. Any carry-over elements in respect of approved capital projects scheduled for this year must obviously be met by the appropriate health board and boards should therefore review their capital priorities for 2001 in the light of commitments carrying forward from previous years. My Department and the health boards take into account, on an ongoing basis, various issues relevant to the planning and delivery of capital pro<Col N="1540" /> jects such as those relating to planning permission, local funding sources, etc.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 301 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics on road traffic accidents, which are compiled from information supplied by the Garda Síochána, are published by the National Roads Authority in its annual road accident facts reports. The most recent such report is in respect of 1998 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Provisional data for 1999 shows that 122 people were killed in that year in road accidents between the hours of 11 p.m and 7 a.m. The licensing status of drivers involved in these accidents is not recorded. Some 44% of all fatal accidents in 1999 occurred on national roads, an increase of 1% on 1998. Some 30% of all fatal accidents occurred in urban areas, a decrease of 3% on the previous year. The number of fatal accidents in rural areas increased by 3% on the 1998 figure and accounted for 70% of all fatal accidents in 1999. Specific analysis has not been made of fatal accidents at junctions with national primary, secondary routes or N-prefix roads.</P>

      <P>Mandatory EU requirements for vehicles entering service include standards for exhaust systems, noise and air pollutant emissions and, in accordance with EU law, must be observed uniformly throughout the union. The requirements do not extend to specifying the positioning of exhaust systems on vehicles nor am I aware of specific regulation of this aspect of vehicle manufacture elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Vehicle emission standards have an important role in the implementation of EU-wide strategies for protecting and improving air quality. In this context, the recent Directive 1999/30/EC specifies mandatory air quality standards for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, lead and particulates. In dealing with the question of gauging ambient air quality for compliance with the standards, it emphasises the importance of representative information and advises that sampling points should be located on the macroscale to avoid measuring very small micro-environments such as those at street edges, car parks, etc. It explicitly advises that sampling points should be at least 25 metres from the nearest major junction and be at least four metres from the centre of the nearest traffic lane.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the integrated approach on which the strategy on air quality is based and which includes vehicle emission standards, is the correct one and that specific requirements relating to the location of exhaust systems on vehicles would not measurably enhance the outcome.</P>

      <P>The report of the independent expert group on mobile phones, the Stewart report, entitled, Mobile Phones and Health, to which the Deputy refers was published in the UK and contains a series of recommendations relating, <i>inter alia</i>, to planning, health, etc. My remit relates to planning and I have had the report examined in that context.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures were published by my Department in July 1996. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. Given the concern expressed during the public consultation process on the guidelines, a statement on health and safety aspects, which the Departments of Health and Children and Public Enterprise agreed with my Department, was included as an appendix to the guidelines. I am satisfied that the planning issues raised by the Stewart report are adequately dealt with in Ireland under current legislation and the guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The recommendations of the Stewart report in relation to the health effects of mobile phones are a matter for the Department of Health and Children while those in relation to the auditing of radiation emissions from masts and base stations are a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>

The grant now covers 90% of the approved cost of the works, compared to two-thirds previously.</P>
      <P>The improvements I have made to the terms and conditions of the scheme since coming into office have increased the effective maximum grant by 75%. The national house building cost Index, which includes only agreed wage rates and the cost of materials, increased by just 15% over the same period.</P>
      <P>I consider it preferable in general that grants be paid directly to applicants rather than a contractor, however, where an applicant would wish a grant to be paid to the contractor this can be arranged by the applicant assigning the grant to the contractor. The grant is currently paid following inspection of the completed works to ensure that the needs of the applicant have been satisfactorily met by the works carried out. I have no proposals to change this practice. The terms and conditions of the disabled persons' grant scheme are kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>My Department does not compile, on a systematic basis, information on the numbers of vacancies in planning, or any other type of posts in the local authorities. However, the most recent survey of the larger local authority planning departments, namely, county councils and county borough corporations, carried out by my Department on 16 October 2000 found that the overall number of serving staff, both administrative and professional, had increased to 1,066, which compared to a figure of 894.5 in September 1999 and a figure of 994 recorded in July 2000. In relation to professional planners specifically, the October survey found that there was a total of 404 authorised posts for professional planners, 103 of which were vacant at that time. Details of the results of the October survey are set out in the attached table, including details of the vacancies for professional planners in each of the planning authorities. My Department does not have information on vacancies for other categories of staff in the planning authorities.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been taken to increase the number of professional planners in the planning system. My Department has written to planning authorities on a number of occasions asking that they consider the adequacy of their staffing to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further measures have been taken to increase the capacity of the planning system and the number of planners. Following on from the publication of Action on Housing in June of this year I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 square metres to 40 square metres. <Col N="1551" /> This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas, to allow planners to concentrate on more complex applications and forward planning issues.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science and the third level education sector with a view to identifying ways of producing more planners through the education system. As a result, from September of this year new and expanded courses in University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street, will treble the output of graduate planners in two years time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum. Further additional courses are also under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the possibility of employing planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being examined. In this regard, my Department is exploring with FÁS the potential to secure planners from abroad through the FÁS Jobs Ireland campaign. As well as jobs fairs in other EU member states and locations such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the campaign also involves the use of the FÁS Jobs Ireland website. My Department will also pursue with the local authorities and the Local Government Computer Services Board the use of information technology to streamline planning procedures.</P>
    <P>Survey of planning authorities in relation to planning staff carried out by the Department of the Environment and Local Government on 16 October 2000.</P>

      <P>The essential repairs grants scheme is targeted at meeting the needs of elderly people living in unfit housing who would otherwise need to be rehoused by the local authority. The scheme enables basic repairs to be carried out to houses which cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. The cost of rewiring a house is not excluded under the scheme but it is a matter for local authorities to assess the circumstances of each individual case and decide what works are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants.</P>

      <P>Before funding was agreed for the voluntary Driving Instructor Register, DIR, in 1996, the register had to satisfy my Department that its organisation and structures would be capable of achieving and maintaining a high standard of driving instruction among its members. In order to become a qualified instructor under the scheme, it is necessary to pass a three part examination and be subject to regular review. The DIR also had to demonstrate that it had wide acceptance among driving instructors by showing that it had at least 300 members. I understand that 679 driving instructors have enrolled with the DIR to date.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, my Department has also provided additional assistance to the DIR which has enabled it to attain ISO 9002 certification. This quality certification is intended to enhance confidence in, and recognition of the DIR. In proposals which I announced on 14 December 1999 for the improved quality control and-or regulation of driving instruction, the creation of other recognised bodies, on the lines of DIR, is among the developments envisaged.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327, 338 and 342 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special Christmas bonus payment was first <Col N="1558" /> introduced in December 1980 as a double payment &ndash; 100% bonus &ndash; and continued at that level until 1984.</P>
    <P>In 1985, for the first time, the long-term unemployed were included and, as a consequence of the additional cost involved, the bonus payment was reduced to 75% of normal weekly payment.</P>
    <P>In 1986, a specific amount of money was allocated which resulted in the payment of a bonus equivalent to 65% of the normal weekly payment to the same categories of recipients as in 1986.</P>
    <P>In 1989, the bonus payment increased to 70% and in 1993, a minimum payment of £20 was introduced.</P>
    <P>The Christmas bonus has been paid at a rate equivalent to 70% of a person's normal weekly payment since 1989, subject to a minimum payment of £20. An amount of £46 million was included in my Department's estimates to pay the bonus this year.</P>
    <P>In October of this year the Government agreed that the bonus payment would be increased to 100% of the weekly payment at an additional cost of £20 million.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Christmas bonus is firmly on long-term welfare payment recipients and any proposal to extend the bonus to persons in receipt of disability benefit would be inconsistent with this basic objective and would create inevitable pressures for its further extension to other short-term categories in the future. It is already open to persons who have been in receipt of disability benefit for at least a year to be assessed for invalidity pension and, if found eligible, to qualify for the Christmas bonus payment.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the cost of extending the 100% Christmas bonus to recipients of disability benefit &ndash; which includes those on injury benefit &ndash; would be an additional £4.4 million. As the Deputies will be aware, such expenditure would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>The bonus will be paid to recipients of the following payments from my Department: disablement pension; death benefit, by way of pension; old age contributory and non-contributory pension; retirement pension; invalidity pension; widow's and widower's non-contributory pension; orphan's contributory and non-contributory; pension; pre-retirement allowance; blind pension; carer's allowance; one parent family payment; unemployment assistance at the long-term rate; farm assist; disability allowance; payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a 65 year old widow whose spouse was not in receipt of the free schemes prior to his death. She applied for a free telephone rental allowance on 2 June 2000. On 5 July 2000 her application was refused on the grounds that she was not herself in receipt of a qualifying payment and her late husband did not have an entitlement which she could retain under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes, which are not age related, recognise the particular difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>Widows or widowers who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions qualify for the widow(er)'s contributory pension &ndash; WCP. Widows or widowers who do not qualify for the contributory pension may, subject to a means test, receive a widows or widowers non-contributory pension &ndash; WNCP &ndash; or, if they have a qualified child, a one-parent family payment &ndash; OFP.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to achieving a rate of £100 per week for all older people in receipt of social welfare pensions.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the weekly rate of the WCP was increased to £89.10 in May 2000 for those aged over 66 while the maximum rate of the WNCP and OFP was increased to £85.50 per week.</P>
      <P>The maximum rate of the WCP for those aged under 66 is £81.10 per week and the equivalent rate for the WNCP and OFP is £77.50. Child dependent allowances which range from £15.20 to £17.00 per week, depending on the payment involved, are also paid where appropriate. Recipients of the OFP may also earn up to £115.38 per week without any loss of payment.</P>
      <P>All widow(er)s over 66 years of age are entitled to avail of the free travel scheme. Those over 66 years of age may also have access to the free electricity and free telephone rental schemes. In order to qualify for these schemes they must be in receipt of a qualifying payment or satisfy a means test and be living alone or with an excepted person. An excepted person can include a qualified adult, dependent children, a person who is disabled, someone who would qualify for the schemes in their own right or someone who gives the pensioner or someone living with the pensioner full-time care and attention. Special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Widows or widowers aged between 60 to 65 whose late spouse had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement provided they continue to satisfy the qualifying conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also a number of additional supports available to widowed people in the period immediately after a bereavement. A bereavement grant of £500 is payable on the death of an insured person. A widowed parent's grant of <Col N="1561" /> £1,000 is available to provide additional support for those with dependent children who qualify for a WCP, an OFP or a bereavement grant. Where the deceased was a social welfare recipient arrangements are in place to continue his or her payments to the widow or widower for six weeks after the bereavement.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of a widows or widowers pension may also receive, when appropriate, half the personal rate of a number insurance type benefits, including disability benefit or unemployment benefit, in addition to their pension payment.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to social welfare provision for widowed people will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to carers on low incomes who look after people, including children, who need full time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Based on the research carried out in the review of the carer's allowance, which was published by my Department in October 1998, the number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. There are currently 16,302 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that 33% of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 77% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%. In June 1997, the allowance for carers who are providing full-time care and attention to more than one person was increased to 150% of their existing entitlement. There are currently 1,353 carers receiving a carer's allowance at this higher rate.</P>
      <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes recognise the particular difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s contributory pension are already very flexible. For instance, to satisfy the yearly average condition, a widow(er)'s entitlement may be based on either the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years. A widow/er may qualify on either his-her own or the late spouse's insurance record; in addition, social insurance contributions paid or credited under the National Health Insurance Acts since 1936 may be used to satisfy the requirement that 156 contributions are paid.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, there are no plans at present to alter the qualifying conditions. However, the position will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>A widow(er)'s non-contributory pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for a contributory pension. Those with children may qualify for the one-parent family payment. Both schemes are subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned was assessed on her own social insurance contribution record. No contributions have been traced in her late husband's name. As she does not have sufficient contributions to meet the minimum standard required for a pension her application was rejected.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards. Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, by participants of employment programmes such as community employment or back to work were <Col N="1564" /> reviewed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The main objective was to address poverty and employment traps faced by people making the transition from unemployment to work. Following those discussions, substantial improvements in the conditions for the retention of rent/mortgage interest supplement were introduced on 6 April 2000.</P>
    <P>These changes include the abolition of the limit of £250 per month in the amount of supplement that could be retained. The means test was also eased, with the introduction of a disregard of the back to work allowance and family income supplement in the assessment of means for the £250 gross household income limit. PRSI and any reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test. Furthermore, support is now provided over four years instead of three years and the withdrawal of the supplement is now tapered at the rate of 75% in year one, 50% in year two, and 25% in years three and four, instead of being withdrawn in one step at the end of the third year.</P>
    <P>People participating in FÁS training courses are not covered by these special arrangements. The training courses are short-term and are designed to help people to gain the skills necessary to move into employment. FÁS training allowances are assessed as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to a rent or mortgage supplement. However, from 6 April 2000 a disregard of £25 per week applies in the case of rent or mortgage interest supplement recipients who participate in such an approved training course. During this training period these people will see a real increase in their income of £25 per week.</P>
    <P>Following these training courses people may have the option to move into employment via an employment programme such as community employment, back-to-work, or they can take up a full time job under the revenue job assist scheme. These programmes and schemes provide vehicles for the retention of all secondary benefits including rent supplement.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these initiatives encourage and ease the movement from welfare to work for people who are reliant on rent supplement.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State <Col N="1565" /> aged 66 years or over. The other free schemes, including the free electricity-gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement provided that prior to the death of the spouse or partner, the couple were permanently residing together and that the survivor continues to meet the normal conditions for eligibility. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published by the policy institute, Trinity College Dublin, in April this year, noted that the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes examined the many demands to extend the free schemes to other groups, including widows and widowers using social inclusion objectives as the criteria for decision. It considered that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or disability.</P>
      <P>Widows or widowers who are not living alone may experience social exclusion but they are not groups in need of community care support nor do they experience the same physical risks of isolation as older people and people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The review noted that, where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes must be based solely on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income. Accordingly, the review concluded that the schemes should not be extended further to additional groups of people or to include other types of schemes. Overall the proposals in the review are being examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>Up to 1 October 1996 the person concerned was in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health board at the maximum rate. His means were assessed at £4 a week derived from the rental of a second property owned by him. When my Department took over the administration of the scheme in October 1996 and the scheme became disability allowance he continued to receive payment at the maximum rate under the transitional arrangements which then applied. The person concerned reached pension age of 66 years on 6 January 2000. He was awarded an old age pension of £92.70 per week with effect from 7 January 2000. This amount comprised a personal rate of £58.50 and an increase of £34.20 in respect of his wife. This was based on a means assessment of £25.96 a week, deriving from the estimated capital value (£40,000) of the second property which he owned. His spouse was subsequently awarded a carer's allowance in her own right at the maximum rate of £76.50 per week. Consequently the qualified adult allowance payable to the person concerned as part of his pension was discontinued. Under social welfare legislation, the property is assessed by reference to its capital value. The property in question was initially valued on a provisional basis at £40,000 but subsequently was valued by the valuation office at £80,000.</P>
      <P>Based on this value the person concerned was entitled to an old age non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £9.50. This was the rate appropriate to his means at that time, assessed in full accordance with the rules set out in the legislation governing this scheme.</P>
      <P>His means were again reviewed in the context of the improved capital assessment rules provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, and this had the effect of increasing his rate of pension to £21.50 per week from 13 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the person made his application for old age pension his entitlement was dealt with in the normal manner by a deciding officer under the relevant old age pension means legislation. As is normal practice in such cases, where a person in receipt of an existing payment indicates that his means have changed, the claim is referred to a local officer for a review of means following that review, in this case the person concerned received notification of the decision in regard to his rate of old age pension, and of his right of appeal against that decision if he was dissatisfied with it. <Col N="1567" /> He appealed to the social welfare appeals office. Having considered all the evidence, including that adduced at an oral hearing, the appeals officer upheld the means assessment.</P>
    <P>The correct procedures appear to have been followed in this case. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The funding will be provided through the capital allocation for the built heritage in the Vote of my Department and the total programme reflects the funding to be made available to me from the Exchequer under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>In deciding on where funding for the built heritage should be allocated in the period to 2006 I gave full consideration to the 740 properties under my control and reached the decision that the emphasis for the period in question should shift from the provision of new or improved facilities for visitors at heritage sites, which has been the main focus for the last decade or so, to the conservation of heritage properties. To this end, and following the review of properties I just referred to, I identified approximately 100 sites which I considered were in need of investment from either a conservation, protection or presentation point of view and, as I announced on 5 November 2000, allocated £65 million to allow the necessary work to be undertaken in a phased manner in the period to 2006.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issues referred to by the Deputy and I met recently with a deputation of local residents to discuss matters with them. As a local representative, I am, of course, concerned at the many issues that arise in situations such as this and I am anxious to help in any way that I can.</P>
      <P>The technical advice available to me from Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, is that the activities presently causing concern to residents do not constitute a threat to the proposed special area of conservation (SAC) at this location. However, I have asked that the matter be investigated further, both by the ecological staff of Dúchas in the context of the SAC, and by its archaeological staff in the context of the archaeological sites in the area.</P>
      <P>From a legal perspective, the Deputy should be aware that under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, responsibility for issues such as illegal encampments, with their attendant problems of illegal dumping, remain the responsibility of the local authority, where such encampments impinge on SACs.</P>

The Deputy specifies the circumstance where a person seeks money from a property owner to vacate his or her property and I am asking the Garda authorities for a report on this practice and, in particular, on the question of the application in these cases of section 17 of the Act of 1994. I have no proposals to extend to the District Court the special jurisdiction which the High and Circuit Courts have to injunct persons from certain courses of action.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to Directive 98/5/EC to facilitate practise of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a member state other than that in which the qualification was obtained. I hope that the directive will be implemented by the end of this year or early next year. The directive will be given effect in Irish law by means of a statutory instrument but some provision in primary legislation is needed also. I intend to make that provision by way of Committee Stage amendment to the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998. The statutory instrument is at a very advanced stage of preparation in consultation with the Bar Council and the Law Society. It is envisaged that the competent authorities for the purpose of the directive will be the Bar Council for lawyers wishing to practise as barristers and the Law Society for those practising as solicitors.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that Directive 89/48/EEC, on a general system for the recognition of higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration, has already been implemented in the State by the European Communities (General System for the Recognition of Higher Education Diplomas) Regulations 1991 (S. I. No. 1 of 1991) made by the Minister for Education. These regulations extend to entry to the legal profession in the State by lawyers who obtained their qualification in another member state.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability. In particular, it will meet the specific needs of students with disabilities in terms of equipment and support services; provide financial support to disadvantaged students by way of additional support to the existing maintenance grants scheme; develop outreach initiatives currently undertaken by a number of third level institutions which involve links with second level schools and community groups and are designed to both assist students to meet the points requirements for the standard CAO entry procedures and to provide complementary special entry arrangements; and expand the provision of particular services, such as counselling and mentoring services, to meet the needs of non-traditional students.</P>
      <P>In the current year, total funding of £3.4 million is provided under this measure, principally for my Department's special fund for students with disabilities; my Department's student assistance-access fund; funding for access officers and seed funding for access schemes within the institute of technology sector; and assistance to the Northside Partnership's higher education support scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September last, I established an action group on access to third level education to advise on measures which would tackle under-representation by disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at <Col N="1583" /> third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>With regard to currency fluctuations, the position is that, since 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In this context, and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including in Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying, and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his-her course.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1996, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continued to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
    <P>In December last, in response to a number of representations, local authorities and vocational education committees were advised that grant holders should be given the option of having their grant paid either in Irish punts or in the currency of the country in which they are studying. This concession allows students studying in Northern Ireland or the UK to receive their grants in Irish punts rather than sterling, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>While the current exchange rate difficulties with sterling are appreciated, my Department is not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the EU. Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 377 together.</P>
      <P>Following the Government announcement in October, I am at present looking at all the issues that arise in relation to the establishment of a body to compensate those who as children were abused while resident in institutions for which the State had regulatory or supervisory functions. This includes all of the issues the Deputy has raised, and indeed other relevant issues.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to convene or to fund a meeting of survivors of child abuse generally to discuss issues relating to compensation. I believe that this is not the most effective way of ensuring that proposals are informed by the views of victims of abuse. There are, however, a number of groups working throughout the country to represent the views of survivors. Officials of my Department have recently written to these groups to inform them that a process leading to the publication of legislation on a compensation body is under way and to invite them to make submissions, either in person or in writing. In addition to representative groups, my Department and I will also consult as widely as possible with legal representatives for abuse victims.</P>
      <P>Following the consultation process and consideration of the complex issues involved, I will present detailed proposals for the establishment of a compensation body to Government for their approval.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the office which my Department has established, together with the Department of Health and Children and the relevant health board is to provide information and support to victims of abuse in childhood. In particular, it will provide information to the victims on the various Government initiatives designed to meet their needs, including the commission to inquire into child abuse and the counselling services provided by the health boards. It will also provide, more generally, information on a wide range of education and social programmes and will assist, as far as practicable, victims of abuse to access these services.</P>
      <P>A number of support groups have been established around the country to support and represent the views of victims of abuse. It is my intention that these groups will, as far as practicable, have a meaningful input into deciding on the nature and extent of the services being provided in the office. Representative groups will themselves be supported by the office primarily through the provision of services such as meeting rooms, secretarial services and expenses for carrying on their work. The extent to which any particular group will be supported will be a matter in the first instance for recommendation by the management committee, made up of representatives of the support groups, and the administrator of the office and will be dependent upon the commitment of the group to support the aims of the office. If any organisation makes an application for support it will be considered by the management committee and the administrator of the office.</P>

      <P>In relation to the application of fair and objective entrance criteria for entry to second level schools, my Department has agreed with the three post-primary managerial associations that the selection of pupils for enrolment in second level schools should not be based on academic ability; each school should disclose its enrolment policy and selection procedures; the criteria used in selecting pupils for enrolment should be made clear to parents in order to allay fears of discrimination and the principle of the school working in and for the community it serves should be emphasised. For this reason, post-primary schools should cater, in the first instance, for children from their own communities and catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Schools are advised to have regard to a range of criteria in forming their selection policy including priority to pupils from national schools in the area; enrolment on a first come, first served basis; random selection on the basis of age of applicants; and priority to brothers and sisters of pupils already enrolled in the school.</P>
      <P>The delivery of a broad and balanced primary curriculum to cater for the development of the full potential of every child is an important principle in primary education provision. Such provision is necessary in order to prepare children to engage effectively with second level education and life long learning. This kind of provision is emphasised in the revised primary curriculum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years reading and language specialists have argued about whether children with reading and learning disabilities have a general linguistic deficit or one in a specific area.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that young children need language processing skills to meet the requirements of skilled reading. Skills in speech perception, vocabulary, short-term memory, syntax and semantics are all important language processing skills for children beginning reading.</P>
      <P>In recent years, phonological and phonetic deficits have been considered by many language authorities to be the language deficits that most clearly distinguish weak from normal readers. There is evidence that deficits in these areas are linked to poor reading. My Department has not carried out any studies in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the revised primary school curriculum for English, an approach to reading development is fostered that is based on children's general language development, including the various language processing skills to which I have already referred. There is a strong emphasis on the development of pupils' listening and speaking skills as part of <Col N="1590" /> an integrated language learning process that links them with the development of reading and writing from the beginning.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the findings of research, a central role in the development of reading is given to the teaching of phonological and phonemic awareness skills in the acquisition of word identification strategies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students, which are administered by the local authorities and vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies. I have recently increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>The funding provisions outlined above are available to those who are unemployed on the same conditions as apply to all candidates-students.</P>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability. In particular, it will meet the specific needs of students with disabilities in terms of equipment and support services; provide financial <Col N="1591" /> support to disadvantaged students by way of additional support to the existing maintenance grants scheme; develop outreach initiatives currently undertaken by a number of third level institutions which involve links with second level schools and community groups and are designed to both assist students to meet the points requirements for the standard CAO entry procedures and to provide complementary special entry arrangements; and expand the provision of particular services, such as counselling and mentoring services, to meet the needs of non-traditional students.</P>
    <P>In the current year, total funding of £3.4 million is provided under this measure.</P>
    <P>On 14 September 2000, I announced the creation of an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education, building on the experience of current initiatives, and to make findings and recommendations accordingly.</P>
    <P>The group will provide a report to me within three months, advising on the specific interventions, which would be most effective in making further progress in achieving these objectives.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>The first instalment will be made to eligible students early in 2001.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that I would expect that up to 10,000 students will benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs administers a back to education allowance, which is available to eligible persons who have been in receipt of certain social welfare payments for at least six months, and who wish to pursue approved second or third level courses.</P>

      <P>The current situation is that the National Educational Psychological Service Agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; does not yet provide a psychological service to the school attended by the named person. However, 26 additional psychologists have taken up their posts in the agency since the beginning of September. As soon as they have completed their programme of induction training, they will begin visiting schools. This will be before the end of this school term. I am unable to say at present which schools in County Mayo will be included in the next expansion phase of NEPS.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that have been experienced by some schools in gaining access to psychological assessments, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists for NEPS. A working group representative of NEPS and the health boards has begun to develop strategies to deal with cases of primary pupils in need of urgent psychological assessment and for whom there is not likely to be a service by NEPS in the short-term. It will report soon and is expected to recommend how such pupils can have the benefit of a psychological assessment.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he has found it necessary to identify students with specific learning difficulties who avail of particular arrange ments when sitting for examinations; if he will consider withdrawing this necessity in view of the fact that it might cause discrimination against such a student; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Inclusiveness and transparency are core principles underpinning the certificate examinations. The examinations were made more inclusive this year by allowing a student, depending on his/her special need, have his/her result in a subject based upon all except some element of the examination in that subject. I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases the grade awarded is a full and accurate reflection of the candidate's performance in the examination and the examination certificates issued by my Department will state that unequivocally.</P>
      <P>This new measure enables a candidate to obtain maximum marks for the subject even though his/her special need precludes him/her from demonstrating attainment in core elements of the standard assessment. As such it discriminates in favour of the special needs candidate by allowing him/her a waiver not available to candidates generally.</P>
      <P>Furthermore the change made this year aligns our examination system with best international practice where changes to standard assessment that arise as a result of granting the assistance of readers and scribes are enabled by including an explanatory note on the examination certificate.</P>
      <P>I can also assure the Deputy that the explanatory note does not make any reference to a candidate's disability or special need. It does no more than provide factual information on how the standard national assessment was modified to facilitate the candidate.</P>

      <P>At post-primary level in Naas, the position is that, following an evaluation of post-primary school requirements in the area, building projects were approved for all three schools in the centre. It is envisaged that, when these projects are completed, there will be sufficient accommodation available to meet future needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At post-primary level in Athy, the position is that a new school building to cater for 350 pupils has been sanctioned for St. Brigid's vocational school. Written confirmation has been received, also, that the two other post-primary schools, Scoil Eoin and Scoil Mhuire, have agreed to amalgamate and a meeting has been arranged <Col N="1595" /> with the school authorities to arrive at an agreed schedule of accommodation. When this process is complete, the Department will conduct a technical examination of both school sites in order to assess which is more suitable to provide the necessary permanent accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, with the provision of a new building for St. Brigid's vocational school and the accommodation required to enable the amalgamation of Scoil Eoin and Scoil Mhuire to take place, there will be sufficient post-primary places available in Athy to meet future needs.</P>

      <P>My Department's planning and building unit has recently issued to County Kildare vocational educational committee for its consideration and acceptance, a schedule of overall accommodation to cater for 350 pupils for the new college proposed for Athy, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>This schedule provides for a floor area of 3468mf7&gt;2 including a PE hall of 606mf7&gt;2, which incorporates a PE ancillary area of 104mf7&gt;2.In addition, as part of the new school project, the Department will fund the provision of four outdoor hardplay areas with a total area of 2,040mf7&gt;2.</P>
      <P>Where site area and configuration permits, an area should be reserved suitable for use as a playing field. The levelling and preparation of this area is not normally covered in the tender documents, but an all-in grant, on application, will be considered.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at present to estab<Col N="1596" /> lish a third level institute in the Dublin Mid-West constituency.</P>
      <P>The future development of higher education in the west Dublin regions will be on the basis of the recommendations of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, which the Government approved in July 1996 as a benchmark for future planning in the technology sector. In accordance with its remit, the committee reviewed the existing provisions and needs for higher education in specific areas. As a response to the higher education needs of west Dublin the steering committee anticipated that the greater Clondalkin region, would be served by Tallaght Regional Technical College and the provision of a new facility in the north-west region. This new facility, Blanchardstown Institute of Technology, was subsequently established in 1999 and was officially opened in November 2000.</P>
      <P>In its 1979 study, Clancy and Benson recommended the provision of a number of new colleges in the greater Dublin region. The first two of these to be in Tallaght and in the Dun Laoghaire-Shankill-Bray area with a third college to be provided in Blanchardstown. Since this study the Tallaght regional technological colleges has expanded and has been re-designated as an institute of technology while the former School of Art in Dun Laoghaire has been re-designated as the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art and Design and Technology.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that documentation submitted some 11 years ago is likely to be archived. However, the Deputy may, if he wishes provide my Department with a copy of the submission in question.</P>

      <P>On Friday 10 November last, I launched the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland. The incoming authority will establish and maintain a framework of qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners in all institutes, colleges and places of further and higher education and training. It will also facilitate lifelong learning and promote access, transfer and progression for all learners including those who have special needs. An important feature of the work of the new authority will be to ensure the recognition of Irish qualifications internationally and of outside qualifications here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> The designate authority will immediately enter into consultations with the relevant stakeholders in the process to clear the way for me to bring the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act fully into operation in the New Year.</P>
    <P>In its designate phase the authority will primarily concern itself with commencing work on the establishment of a national framework of qualifications and advise on and support the transition to the new certification system as set out in the Act. In this regard, the designate authority held a further meeting on 27 November as part of this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities. The three other schemes of student support are administered by the vocational education committees. As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 898 of 7 November 2000, the information sought by the Deputy has had to be collated from data requested from the local authorities and vocational education committees by my Department. It should be pointed out that these bodies are still processing additional grant applications.</P>
      <P>The relevant data have now been furnished to my Department by the local authorities and vocational education committees. I have set out, in the following tables, the information requested by the Deputy in relation to grants approved, and paid, by the local authorities and the vocational education committees in respect of the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarships scheme; and the European Social Fund-aided maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses &ndash; PLC.</P>
      <P>In relation to the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees &ndash; formerly the European Social Fund-aided third level courses maintenance grants scheme for trainees &ndash; the position is that, while it is the vocational education committees which process and approve the applications, claims for payment are made by the individual institutes of technology to my Department. Accordingly, the vocational education committees do not hold data on the number of students actually paid under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should also note that, in respect of some vocational education committees, the number approved under the PLC scheme is less than the number actually paid. This arises due to the administrative arrangement whereby each VEC approves grants in respect of candidates who reside within its area but makes grant payments in respect of only those candidates who attend PLC centres within its catchment area. This procedure can account for delays in the payment of approved grants under the PLC scheme.</P>

      <P>The planning section of my Department is currently examining the need for a new post-primary school in the Leghanamore, Togher, area of County Cork arising from an application received recently from County Cork Vocational Education Committee for provision of a new community college to serve the area.</P>
      <P>The examination is focusing on the growth in population as a result of housing developments in Leghanamore, details of which have been sought from Cork County Council. Account will be taken, also, of the capacity of existing post-primary schools in the general area to cater for emerging needs.</P>
      <P>As soon as the information on housing developments is received and assessed in the light of current school capacity, a decision will be made on the post-primary school requirements of the area.</P>

      <P>Architectural planning for the provision of a new two-classroom school at Dysart, Mullingar, County Westmeath is proceeding as quickly as possible having regard to the large number of school building projects on hand within my Department.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say at this point when construction will commence. It is not open to my Department to provide cost estimates for building projects in advance of tenders being sought as this would compromise the tendering process. The local contribution will be 5% of the total cost capped at £50,000.</P>

      <P>The issue of the disposal of the premises in question is under consideration in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, it is necessary to ascertain within my Department whether the premises in question may be required for different forms of educational provision to that provided by the committee. Having now concluded that process, my Department does not consider that the premises are required for alternative educational provision.</P>

      <P>My Department is not aware of the details of this case.</P>
      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports <Col N="1606" /> which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
    <P>In order to progress this case further a questionnaire has issued to the child's parents which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with their written permission to contact schools and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, on behalf of the child.</P>

      <Quest>the reason day pupils who were sexually abused are being excluded from a hearing at the commission for victims of abuse; and if he will outline the financial support which is available to victims for legal costs, medical advice and therapy to assist them in their preparation for the commission.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person who was abused as a child in an institution may give evidence to either the confidential or investigation committee of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. This includes children who were day pupils in primary and post primary schools.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I have a responsibility under the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, to put in place a scheme relating to expenses. Although it is not necessary that individual victims of abuse should be legally represented when they give evidence to the commission, I accept that there are many victims who would welcome the support of a legal representative. For that reason, my Department is, together with the Attorney General's office, involved in preparing a scheme to meet the legal expenses of those who attend the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and who want legal representation. I regret that there have been significant difficulty in reaching agreement with the legal profession on a scheme, of which there have so far been two separate proposals by my Department and the Attorney General's office and one by the commission. Devising a workable scheme remains a high priority for me.</P>
      <P>As regards medical support issues, the Department of Health and Children has, through the health board structure, put in place a nationwide system of counsellors to assist and support victims of abuse, not just to aid them in attending the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse but also for more general and long-term support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the Government has recently decided in principle to establish a body to compensate those persons who as children were abused in institutions in which they were resident and for which the State had significant regulatory or supervisory responsibility. The basis for this decision is that the children concerned were separated from their parents and therefore did not have the care and protection which children in <Col N="1607" /> the care of their parents enjoy. They relied to a significant extent on public bodies to protect them and it is now all too clear that notwithstanding that duty children were abused. These considerations do not apply to children who were resident with their families while at school and so the decision to set up a compensation body does not extend to them.</P>
