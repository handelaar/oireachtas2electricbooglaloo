      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Drafting of the Bill to create the Office for Economic and Social Development is proceeding. As Deputies will be aware, arising out of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is intended to locate the National Centre for Partnership and Performance within the proposed Office for Economic and Social Development alongside the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum.</P>
      <P>The discussions with the social partners regarding the detailed arrangements to be put in place to give effect to the strengthened institutional structures have been concluded, and proposals were brought to Government in July. These were agreed and the parliamentary counsel is being asked to incorporate the necessary amendments relating to the NCPP into the draft legislation.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Bill will now be published in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the value of these organisations is to be found in the extent to which the Government is willing to listen to them and to take their proposals on board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The three organisations, the NESC which looks at the overall national strat<Col N="222" /> egy, the NESF which helps in the preparation, implementation and monitoring and now the partnership process which looks at better practices within the private and public sector, are the three strands and all have to work closely with Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach says the value of a body such as the NESF is demonstrated by the Government's willingness to take its views on board, will the Government take on board the NESF's views that the Government's individualisation proposals benefited only the better off in that 20% of the top income cohort got 80% of the benefit and that the NESF's views should be taken into account in that this divisive and unnecessary approach to tax policy should be set aside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are matters for the budget but we do take account of the views of these organisations. The NESF and the NESC have put forward their views on other budgetary aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, included in last year's list of legislation published in September, was promised for late 1999. Will the Taoiseach explain what the significant changes are in the drafting of the legislation that arose out of the negotiations with the social partners leading to the current programme? In what way will the draft Bill now being cleared and with the parliamentary draftsman be significantly different from that which was all but cleared more than 12 months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only difference is that NCPP was not included in the framework of the first legislation. The legislation is exactly the same but NCPP was changed as part of the process of the last programme. As the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness came into being the discussions took place between the social partners to include NCPP in what is the umbrella group now to look after the three organisations. That is the only change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the only change and bearing in mind that virtually every ministerial speech lauds social partnership as one of the foundations upon which our recent success has been constructed, does the Taoiseach think the delay of more than a year is warranted? Can he indicate that he will bring in this legislation at the earliest possible opportunity in the new year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be introduced at the earliest possible opportunity, but it has not been delayed for more than a year. What was agreed in the programme was that this would be included within the umbrella and that it would be left to the social partners to discuss how best that should happen. Those discussions did not start until Easter. I admit it has delayed the legislation somewhat. NCPP will now be part of the legislation and I hope it will help to deepen the partnership arrangements through the various mechanisms <Col N="223" /> which were working. They have extended their role and we will try to get the legislation through as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Government approved this initiative on 11 April, I am pleased to report that considerable progress has already been made. A project manager &ndash; within my Department &ndash; was appointed in April. Funding for the consultancy element was sought from the information society fund and approval in principle has been obtained. A request for tenders under local tendering procedures for phase 1 issued in June. Tenders have been received and evaluated. The Department is now in the process of appointing consultants. Phase 1, which will provide detailed recommendations for the development of the project, should be completed early in the spring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the likely cost of the project in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not know the cost for 2002 and 2003 or even for the second half of 2001 until the evaluation takes place. I do not have a figure for the initial cost. I do not think the initial project cost, which involves approximately four months work, will be expensive. There are not many individuals involved but their job is to examine how the present system works to evaluate how it can be changed from a manual to an ICT system and to examine the security procedures in use currently because we are talking about the process of using papers and documents. As soon as that is finished in spring, I envisage the second phase will be costly because it will involve not only the Cabinet secretariat but also all Departments and, indeed, some other agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will computer terminals be installed in the Cabinet room at the place of each Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy say &ldquo;replacing each Minister&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, at the place of each Minister. In the Government's case it might be an improvement. Will computer terminals with document display facilities be installed at the Cabinet table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It could well mean that because the objective of the entire project is to try to remove paper and memoranda as completely as possible from the Cabinet room. The project <Col N="224" /> team is working on the basis that that can be done. We will see following the evaluation, but I think it can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach commits himself to this, will he consider not just the technological difficulties but also the psychological effects this might have in so far as if there are terminals at the table people will be in a less collegial setting, each with their own screen and so forth? It will not necessarily lead to the type of discussion that one may need to have at Cabinet. Is assistance being sought before a major capital investment is committed to, to ensure this improves Cabinet Government in its real expression, which is 15 people making a decision, rather than in its theoretical sense, which is the production of masses of documents at the touch of a button even though such documents may not be capable of being read by the people in that setting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I have said. The project is being set up and it involves looking at and evaluating the entire procedure to ascertain whether it merits change. The Deputy will agree, when looking at modern day electronic processing which is used extensively in Departments for other arrangements, most of the paper involved in the present process could well be eliminated. Discussion will take place but rather than using 30 to 40 page memoranda it would be quite easy to get to the point one wants. Most presentations, which I have seen during interdepartmental discussions where power points are used effectively, eliminate paper and use only slide sheets. The present process is very old fashioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many assumptions contained in what the Taoiseach says about things being old fashioned. If it works, it works and if does not work, it does not work. I assume the Taoiseach believes that the current Cabinet system of government works. Apart from reducing the amount of paper Ministers have to carry &ndash; and if business is properly managed the amount of paper that Minister's have to bring to Cabinet with them will not be that great, anyway &ndash; what are the other benefits that will be delivered by this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The unique character of Cabinet, which is a forum for Ministers to continue to meet in person to discharge their collective responsibility, is not what we are talking about. If there are 25 items on an agenda which would cover perhaps 500 or 600 pages, is the most effective and efficient way of having that information to carry it from A to Z where people cannot access it quickly? With new technology, people can access a memorandum under a specific heading far more quickly than by using paper-based files. We see that happening every day in a matter of seconds. If it is not efficient, more effective or <Col N="225" /> time saving and useful, phase one will show that to be the case, but it would be extraordinary if that was not the case. We have seen how the system was operated both here and during the DIRT hearings. There are many examples and it is already being used in the committees of the House. At this stage, we are looking at the Cabinet project during its first stage to see if information communication technology can be operated more effectively, given the unique character of collective responsibility in Cabinet and the security aspect involved. Next spring we will see if that is the case, or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach familiar with Parkinson's law which states that work expands to fill the time available? Is he not aware of the risk, therefore, that documentation may expand to fill the technology available? As a result of this, Ministers may be overloaded with vast amounts of material which is not on paper but is nominally on file. The sort of discipline that should be undertaken by officials in preparing crisp, short memoranda for Ministers will be lost as people just load stuff on to the computer in a fashion that does not do justice to the Cabinet process, or is not necessarily fair to Ministers who should be able to make decisions on net points that are presented in a net fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton knows, the current high standards of memoranda, giving a short summary on the front of the file, would not change. A decision will be made as to whether they will remain in a written or IT format. Let us see how it will happen. I think it will prove to be a useful enough exercise. We discussed this last June. It would be unlikely for us to move in one fell swoop from a totally paper-based system to an information communication technology system. The system can be improved from where it now stands, however. I notice that most Ministers and Department officials are already using overhead projectors and power points in their presentations. Compared to what existed five years ago, the system has changed dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think the implementation of this new communication technology system will cut down on the need for advisers in Government, or does he think it could possibly expand the need for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It might expand the information communication technology advisers in the first place, since most Departments do not have too many of them.</P>

      <P>As almost all parties in this House are likely to be in Government at some time or other, would the Taoiseach agree that a project of this nature, which affects Cabinet Government, ought to be the subject of some consultation with parties in Opposition so that we will have an opportunity of seeing what is envisaged?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach intranet was brought into operation in June 2000. This is an internal Departmental resource and all members of staff have access to it. It uses web technologies to improve access to information resources and to improve the departmental information base. Enhancements to the design and the information content are ongoing.</P>
      <P>In relation to the website, my Department is considering the strategies to be adopted to enhance its utility for communicating with clients and the public. It needs a better client oriented focus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regard must also be had to the strategic plans being prepared by Departments generally for the development of electronic public services. To assist it in its task, the Department proposes to seek external expertise, and tenders for this are to issue shortly. In the meantime, work is continuing on assembling potentially useful content for the website which will be updated as frequently as necessary. There has been no recent change of criteria to decide the content matter hosted on <Col N="227" /> the Department's website. Criteria will be developed when a decision is reached on the strategic approach to be adopted.</P>
    <P>The first ever webcast by my Department was made on 21 September last at the Reach launch from Government Buildings. At present no further webcasts are planned, but this may change as the situation merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach measure the number of hits he had with his webcast?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did he not do so then? Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House the criteria used for deciding the material that goes on the website of his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the major statements, policy initiatives or information considered relevant to the public is put on the website. It must also fit in with the plans for the development of electronic public services, the Reach programme and the Government action plan for the information society, which involve any services useful to the public.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply, I do not consider the Department of the Taoiseach website marvellous in that regard. We must examine further the criteria that will help the public. Some other Departments have moved ahead in this area, such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and others which deal more with the public. They have enhanced their websites in the past year or so. That is what is being examined at present in the Department. Most of the usual information that is of interest to more than a small number is put on the website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the benefit of any of this new technology depends on its regular update and maintenance? Will he explain why, until yesterday, the last update on his Department's website was 11 October in which the announcement was made regarding the Taoiseach welcoming the contract for the Dublin Port Tunnel? The next item to go on the website was his belated, if welcome, address to the European Movement yesterday. Will the Taoiseach outline if he is satisfied with current arrangements within his Department for the maintenance and updating of the website? If not, what changes, if any, does he propose to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my statement, and not wishing to repeat myself, the website is not as good as it could be or as good as some of those of other Departments which are more focused on dealing with the public. We are examining how <Col N="228" /> we can communicate better with clients who use the Department. Major statements, such as yesterday's statement which was put on the website last night, or any of the more important statements made which would be accessed in Brussels or elsewhere are put on it. Not everything is put on the website because there would not be a great number of hits if that were done.</P>
      <P>The internal end as regards messages and notes is fine, but we try to help the public wherever we can. There is no doubt the public is using the Internet much more frequently. Recent surveys show that even in the inner city 46% of the people use it for information. The position has changed in two years and Departments generally, and mine in particular, should provide information in whatever area people seek it.</P>

      <P>I officiated at the launch of the &ldquo;Statement of Irish Government Policy: e-Business in Ireland for the International Financial Services Industry&rdquo; document on Tuesday, 12 September with Michael d'Souza of Merrill Lynch, who chaired the e-commerce sub-group of the IFSC clearing house group, and Sean Dorgan of IDA Ireland, which is distributing the booklet through its overseas offices. The booklet has been laid before the Dáil and the Seanad. My Department distributed 3,000 copies of the document. There has been a very high level of demand for the booklet and a further print run is likely.</P>
      <P>It will be used by IDA Ireland in promoting the benefits of Ireland as a location in the emerging electronic environment. It is also being used by leading figures in the financial industry in promoting Ireland within their institutions. There has been very positive feedback in this regard from the industry.</P>
      <P>The e-commerce sub-group consisted of industry representatives and members of relevant Departments and agencies. The e-commerce working group has now reported back to the clearing house group on issues to be addressed in developing the IFSC further in the light of technological change.</P>
      <P>The main findings of the working group were that the key determinants for the expansion of e-business within financial services here are similar to the generic needs identified by other bodies, such as the Information Society Commission.</P>
      <P>Needless to say, the Government will continue to focus its efforts on developing Ireland as a centre for international financial services. E-commerce will form a vital part of the Government's approach to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said recently to Deputy Bruton, that is one of many issues. The concern is that until this area is tied down, which it is far from being in either Europe or the rest of the world, people will continue to move where they can get the lowest rates of value added tax.</P>
      <P>However, that is only one of the issues. The major issues in this area are that we have the facilities, staff and people who are prepared to change quickly, that we are prepared to change our regulatory system, we have broadband connectivity throughout the country and that we keep ourselves abreast of changes and update our services &ndash; in this case, financial services &ndash; to accommodate the vastly changing position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial services industry is remarkably successful and this report progresses from the enormous strengths of the industry as it stands today. The industry is growing massively at present and that is why it is looking at e-commerce. There has been an incredible 60% increase in fund assets within Dublin and most of the schemes use information technology. The total amount of money being managed has reached US$176 billion. The IFSC, particularly the fund sector, is now global. A total of 50% of the funds are from the UK. The US is the largest originator and Germany, South Africa and Italy have increased their share dramatically. Most of the top banks in the world are operating, in one way or other, out of the centre.</P>
      <P>What the centre must do to protect itself as it changes &ndash; it will change over the next ten years &ndash; is look at how best it can sell itself as a leading location for financial services business. One of the elements of that is VAT but it certainly is not the one of most concern at this stage. Both the IDA and the financial services industry, through their companies, clients and new clients around the world, have to sell the centre in a positive fashion and ensure they have the ability in a global market to do those figures and that amount of business. It yields approximately £0.25 billion in tax revenue for this country every year. All aspects of that will have to be looked at. In the meantime, the document which I launched in early September is being promoted worldwide by the companies and the clearing house group I mentioned.</P>

Enormous progress is being made in this area. The figures I mentioned are just part of what they are doing. They have already identified what they are required to do. The VAT rate is one of the many issues that have to be addressed but it is a matter which will be dealt with in the budget and the Finance Bill, not as part of an e-commerce report.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that given the fiasco which surrounded the unfortunate attempt by the Government to appoint Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the post of vice-president of the European Investment Bank and the manner in which that was pursued by the Cabinet, there is a lesson to be learned by every Member of the House? That lesson was learned first, perhaps, by Fianna Fáil activists in south Tipperary. Will he agree that, notwithstanding what might have been practice in the past, it is time for the State to move forward? Against that background and the painful experience the Cabinet undoubtedly had, not to mention the personalities directly involved, will he not reconsider his reply and see that there is greater transparency by involving the Oireachtas or a committee of the Oireachtas in appointments to posts of the importance of either European Commissioner or, in this instance, nominee to the European Investment Bank?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Quinn's point, in terms of the overall reform mechanisms, there are many elements in this House that should be reformed. The committee system and some of the good points presented by all parties regarding the overall process are aspects I support and consider have merit, and I am prepared to consider them.</P>
      <P>Almost all the appointments to the boards of the bodies, including the National Economic and Social Council, the Economic and Social Forum, the National Statistics Board, the National Centre for Partnership and the Law Reform Commission, under the aegis of my Department are nominated elsewhere. I have little or no control over or say in those appointments. The number of appointments I make to those boards that have not been discussed and decided on by the social partners or the agencies are few and far between. I am prepared to consider proposed changes to systems and mechanisms. I agree with the Deputy regarding the lessons to be learned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the last part of the Taoiseach's reply that he agrees there is a sense of objection, if not rejection, among the public at what they perceive to be cronyism by Governments in the appointment of various individuals to particular posts, that the day of cronyism has come to an end and that it is desirable, irrespective of who is in Government, that the appointment of persons to public bodies should be subject to some degree of transparent scrutiny that meets the standards of this Republic at the beginning of this millennium? Is that the import of what the Taoiseach is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of those posts are already open to some scrutiny and I object to the interpretation that perhaps they are not. The level of openness, transparency and accountability such post holders have to their relevant organisations is not always understood. When I issue this schedule Members will realise that with regard to these several hundred appointments, the Government has no role other than to rubber-stamp them. As far as I am aware successive Governments in the past 20 years have not made a change to any of the nominations made by the nominating bodies. That fact of life is not clearly understood.</P>
      <P>Consideration should be given to the credibility of the people who take up such positions. The type of quality people we want to serve on our State boards will not answer ads in weekend newspapers and thereby put themselves forward to take up such positions. As Deputy Quinn is aware, in many cases it is not easy to get suitable people to take up many of these posts, regardless of whether they have a political allegiance. Increasingly in the past ten years, more and more Governments have appointed to boards, people who would be known to have other political views, because it was necessary to do so. I do not have a fundamental difficulty with examining a system that helps to make that more transparent providing it would not be objectionable to the people involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that when the changes were made regarding the appointment of judges it was argued that members of the Bar would be reluctant to let their names go forward indicating their availability for consideration on the grounds that it would be contrary to their best professional prospects, but that has not been the experience? While I accept the Taoiseach has not changed the method of decision-making from that of previous Governments, in light of the widespread cynicism and collapse in public trust in the perception of the way in which certain appointments are made by the Government of the day, does he consider there is a need to change the way in which appointments are made to major key posts? Does the Taoiseach see the Oireachtas having a role in providing the kind of democratic scrutiny that the public manifestly desires?</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn has based his arguments on one case. He has a valid point, as there has been considerable controversy about that case, but I detect no difficulties or cynicism regarding the generality of posts filled in statutory bodies. If the Deputy is saying there is cynicism regarding some important posts and that we should consider Oireachtas involvement in filling them, I would have no difficulty with that. Some of the ideas being mooted regarding posts in general &ndash; not necessarily by the Deputy &ndash; include advertising the posts and bringing applicants before a star chamber.

Should major posts, such as the appointment of a European Commissioner or director of the EIB, not require some involvement of the Oireachtas? There is a limited number of such posts and I do not propose the Government should lose the right to initiate, as that should always stay with the Executive.

Does he also agree that an element of political responsibility is necessary if there is to be political accountability and that if Ministers are completely removed from the process they cannot be held accountable for what happens? If there is to be transparency there must be some method of examining proposed appointees, perhaps by way of an Oireachtas committee. Given that Governments are ultimately accountable to the electorate and that this accountability should not be sub-con<Col N="236" /> tracted out to those who are accountable to no one, perhaps we should take the approach of maintaining political initiative and ensuring that the House, through its committees, retains the power to scrutinise. We will, thereby, achieve transparency. I suggest that this mixture of political accountability and transparency might be the best way to proceed.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make policy for the House. However, there is no doubt that we can consider this area and make progress in respect of it. Matters have already changed dramatically. I am not sure how it worked in the old days but most of the men and women who serve on State boards today do so out of a great sense of national duty. The majority of these individuals do not serve on such boards because of their political allegiances. By and large, the level of work these people are obliged to do is far greater than was the case when I first became a Minister.</P>
      <P>The position of State boards is changing. Some of them are in transition, a number of them may change in the future and some have already been placed on a statutory footing. It would be beneficial to involve the House in a more detailed manner in making appointments to key posts.</P>

      <P>It does, it will match in with the report on Oireachtas reform. The committee in question will bring forward a set of proposals in respect of a number of areas. That system has only been in place for a short period and Deputy Quinn excluded it during his questions. The only matter of a legal nature to which he referred involved the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
      <P>The Nally report recommends that county solicitors should be removed from the remit of the Attorney General and placed under that of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That proposal is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be my fault or that of the House, but the view among members of the public that all of the positions on statutory committees and boards are filled by means of appointments made by Ministers of the day is incorrect. It is obvious that the Cabinet of the day has no responsibility for the majority of appointments to the various <Col N="237" /> boards and statutory organisation. Considering the involvement of the Judiciary, local authorities and the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission and the fact that State boards are now in the private domain, there are not that many positions to which appointments are made by the Government. However, I take Deputy Quinn's point that there are certain important, full-time, permanent and pensionable posts to which appointments should perhaps be made in another way.</P>

If Hugh O'Flaherty had been appointed by a commission to the EIB, there would have been no political accountability for the mistake made. There was accountability because there was political responsibility and the Government suffered embarrassment.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has approved the drafting of a Bill to establish an office of ombudsman for children. A parliamentary counsel has been appointed to prepare the Bill. Officials of my Department are working with the parliamentary counsel with a view to ensuring the Bill is ready for publication by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the office will be independent and that the ombudsman for children will be appointed by the President and accountable to the Oireachtas. It is also proposed that the principal functions of the ombudsman for children will be as follows: the promotion of the welfare and rights of children; to respond to individual complaints; the establishment of mechanisms through which there will be regular consultation with children and an advisory role to Government.</P>
      <P>The appointment of an ombudsman for children is an important part of the national children's strategy which the Taoiseach will launch on Monday, 13 November. The strategy will provide a framework for addressing the range of children's needs in an integrated way over a period of years.</P>

We did not await the relevant legislation; he was appointed and the legislation followed later. Given the work done in the High Court by Mr. Justice Kelly in highlighting children's issues, that secure accommodation could not be found for a 17 year old, that a 16 year old was subsequently found dead in a Dublin flat and the appalling weather conditions which have to be endured by children on the street, is it too much to expect that the Minister of State will address the question asked? Given the serious situation, particularly in regard to child homelessness, the children's needs highlighted by the Judiciary and the precedent set in the appointment of Mr. Michael Mills as administrative Ombudsman, will the Minister agree to appoint an ombudsman for children in advance of the promised legislation?</P>

I have been asking on the Order of Business every day when we can expect to see it. It has been long fingered.

The heads of the proposed Bill were brought to Government in April in the context of the national children's strategy which will be launched next week.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to announce the provision of additional nursing home places as part of the £25 million winter initiative package to alleviate anticipated service pressures on the acute hospital sector. Under the initiative, additional places will be contracted from private nursing homes by health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these places will be additional to the number of private nursing home places currently subvented or contracted by health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I am satis<Col N="240" /> fied that this part of the initiative will have a significant impact on the problem of inappropriate use of acute hospital beds with the immediate provision of additional bed capacity in a more appropriate setting.</P>
      <P>I am also giving approval as part of the initiative to the recruitment of an additional 25 accident and emergency consultants. Details of this element of the initiative are being finalised in discussions with various parties and it is my intention that the recruitment process will get under way as soon as possible. The appointment of 25 additional consultants to the accident and emergency service represents the most significant single investment in this key hospital sector for many years. I am confident that the appointment of the additional consultants will ensure early clinical intervention at a senior level, reduce waiting times and thus improve patient access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will accept that this is a very disappointing reply. Is he aware that, according to his reply, he is not providing additional beds, but taking the existing pool of nursing home beds which are already in short supply and using them as step-down facilities to a greater degree than in the past? If he contacts a few private nursing homes, as I have done, he will find that nursing home owners are extremely concerned at the lack of spare capacity. Is he aware that elderly persons will be unable to access beds in nursing homes which will be used as step-down facilities?</P>
      <P>Given the warnings from the major hospitals about a winter bed crisis because of extra accident and emergency admissions, does the Minister agree that it is unsatisfactory to reply that he is unable to indicate when the consultant appointments which he said would be made to deal with the winter crisis will be made? Surely it would be better to be clear and truthful about the reality, that the appointments will be made too late to deal with the winter crisis. When will the posts be filled? Will they be filled this month or next year? The Minister has had time to set out a timetable. The announcement is now weeks old.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the appointments will be made as soon as possible. This will not deal with the winter bed crisis already indicated by the major hospitals and causing elective operations to be cancelled. Patients in desperate pain cannot access the treatment they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to the question, the first of which is the contracting of additional nursing home beds. Last year significant difficulties were encountered in the winter period in discharging high dependency patients from acute hospital services. In that context we need immediate alleviating action over the winter period. Some time ago we approached the health boards with a view to them sourcing additional spare capacity and new capacity in terms of contracting additional beds. The alternative is to do <Col N="241" /> nothing and to allow mayhem in the acute hospital services over the winter period.</P>
      <P>Last year a total of 160 beds were contracted. This year we are contracting a minimum of 500 beds throughout the country. That is the proper response to ensuring we have some degree of additional capacity over the winter period for placing people with high dependency and to try to alleviate and give greater throughput to the acute hospital services.</P>
      <P>I take issue with the carping criticism of our announcement which will in essence double the number of A&amp;E consultants in the country. There are 19 to date. We have secured not only the additional costs for the remainder of the year but full year costs for an additional 25 A&amp;E consultants. We are working with Comhairle na n-Óspidéal and other bodies to ensure these posts can be put in place, if necessary on a temporary basis in the short-term while permanent sanction is awaited.</P>
      <P>People should acknowledge that this is a far more significant announcement in terms of A&amp;E than previously. It will ensure the provision of senior clinicians and senior decision makers in the A&amp;E departments throughout the country. All analyses from time immemorial have pointed to that problem. Certain issues need to be worked out and we are addressing them.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, it is important to define clearly what is meant by a waiting list. A waiting list comprises all persons who, following referral to a hospital consultant, have been listed by the consultant for treatment as a public in-patient and who must wait until the necessary hospital facilities are available for such treatment. The waiting list should comprise only those who <Col N="242" /> could, if the facilities were available, be treated immediately.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists must be seen in context. As at 30 June 2000, there were 31,851 persons on hospital in-patient waiting lists. This figure has to be viewed in the context of the overall activity of more than 750,000 procedures carried out in our hospitals annually. Waiting lists are not uniform across all specialities and vary between hospitals and geographical areas. The most acute waiting lists tend to exist in high volume specialities such as ENT and ophthalmology, or in specialities where there is demand for specialised treatments such as cardiac artery bypass grafts and hip replacements. These latter procedures often reflect technological progress in treatment.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists are a feature of many health systems across the world, as identified in the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative, which also identified all the factors that lead to the creation of waiting lists. The report made a series of recommendations to deal with them. Health systems throughout the developed world are experiencing similar difficulties in catering for all the demands that arise in some specialities.</P>
      <P>The waiting list initiative was introduced in June 1993 and was the subject of a comprehensive review in 1998. The report of the review group contained a comprehensive set of recommendations. As of 30 June 2000, the overall numbers on waiting lists fell by 5,004 which is a reduction of 13.58% on the end of the December 1999 figure.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards earlier this year, I announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable additional waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This brings the dedicated funding to waiting list procedures to £34 million this year. These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative, the national bed capacity review and the winter initiative, which I recently announced. In essence, all of these issues deal with the fundamental reason behind the build-up of waiting lists, which is the physical capacity within the acute hospital services, primary care and services to the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minster aware that there is a waiting list to get on a waiting list to see a consultant? Is he aware that a recent letter to an Irish newspaper reported that a 91 year old man lay on a trolley in a Dublin hospital for three days? Will he confirm that in the case of neurosurgery, neurology, vascular surgery and gastroenterology, the waiting lists have increased? An <Col N="243" /> analysis of the so-called reduction in the waiting lists in one hospital showed that 87 patients had their surgery done elsewhere, 330 were removed from the list because they had received two letters from the hospital which were not answered within four weeks, 30 had other medical problems with preventive surgery, 17 were finance related, 12 needed back-up or intensive care and could not proceed, 64 had to see the consultant again because they had been so long on the list and 30 had died. Is this the way the waiting list is reduced by 5,004? It is more like the work of a three card trick merchant than a Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside personal comments, validation processes are as important as any other factors in terms of determining who is on a list. I am sure all Members want an accurate picture of the numbers on the list at any given time. We have increased capacity within the system. It is a pity that when Deputy Mitchell held high office his Government did not maintain a consistent allocation towards the waiting list initiative. It is also a pity that there was a reduction in the funding for the initiative during the previous Government's last year in office.</P>
      <P>Capacity is the issue here. Ultimately, we will comprehensively deal with the waiting list initiative only if we increase capacity at both ends of the spectrum, within the primary care side, especially more innovative projects at A&amp;E level &ndash; we recently sanctioned one in St. James's Hospital and other units throughout the country &ndash; and, more importantly, with the development of services to the elderly, which relate to assessment, rehabilitative units, more long-term residential units and so on. That is the long-term comprehensive approach to dealing with the waiting list initiative. Additional human resources are also required.</P>
      <P>There has been an increased number of procedures arising out of the additional funding we have made available. There has also been some reductions through some hospitals, not all, validating their lists. However, validation can work both ways. In some hospitals it can lead to an increase in the numbers on the list.</P>

In particular, I intend to facilitate further significant development of the mental health services under the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately £150 million capital is being provided over the lifetime of the national development plan for the development of the <Col N="245" /> mental health services. A significant part of this funding will go towards general hospitals for a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. At the end of the period of the national development plan, it is the intention to have the programme of acute psychiatric units completed which will mean that acute admissions to the old psychiatric hospitals will no longer occur. The plan will also provide for more community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences which will further accelerate the phasing out of the old institutions.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed in the inspector's report about difficulties in recruiting qualified psychiatric nursing personnel, which were particularly acute in the eastern region. However, more than £1 million has been provided for local and national marketing campaigns undertaken by the Nursing Careers Centre and the schools of nursing around the country. The success of these campaigns is evident from the fact that the schools of nursing have since succeeded in filling a record 254 training places in psychiatric nursing in 1999 and this record figure was exceeded this year, rising to 300. Increasing the annual intake of student psychiatric nurses is a key element in the Government's strategy for addressing the current shortage of nurses.</P>
    <P>In his report, the inspector also referred to the lack of multi-disciplinary teams in many mental health services, particularly in the area of psychology and social work services. Additional resources of £1.4 million were provided to health boards in 2000 for improvements in these services. The inspector also highlighted a number of other service and quality of care issues which were raised with individual service providers. These issues will continue to be pursued with a view to bringing about the improvements required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, over past decades, mental health services have been among the most neglected areas of the health services? The people in need of these services deserve the same level of care, albeit inadequate, as people in the general health services. Does the Minister agree that the widespread prescription of poly-pharmacy drugs is totally unacceptable and that the lack of any planned approach to reviewing the drug intake of long-stay patients is disgraceful? Does the Minister have plans to ensure that this practice will cease and that the prescription of drugs in all mental institutions will be frequently reviewed on a mandatory basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that mental health services did not receive the same priority as other health services over the decades, nor were they accorded the priority they deserved. However, there has been a significant improvement in this area in recent years in terms of the development of acute psychiatric units within hospitals and the development of community facilities and residences throughout the country. The position of people <Col N="246" /> with intellectual disability has also been significantly improved in that institutionalisation is being phased out and there is a move towards improved community facilities.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the widespread administration of medication to a number of psychiatric patients. I am not a clinician and while clinical autonomy should prevail in regard to the overall treatment protocol of individual patients, the development of increasing numbers of multi-disciplinary teams will lead to an improved holistic approach to patients' treatment. The proposals contained in the mental health Bill will go some way towards improving the position in regard to the administration of medication to patients. In particular, the establishment of the mental health commission will ensure a review of the operation of mental hospitals throughout the country and will result in more proactive action being taken on behalf of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the improved position of people with intellectual disabilities. Will he comment on the inspector's view that it is totally inappropriate that 300 such people are receiving in-patient care in psychiatric hospitals? Does he agree it is inappropriate that these patients should have to share accommodation with patients suffering from functional psychotic illnesses? The inspector takes a very serious view of the derogation of the duty to deliver appropriate care to both of the above groups. The problems experienced by some elderly people are more of a geriatric than psychiatric nature and they should be catered for in geriatric facilities. There are three groups of people who are not receiving proper treatment, namely, those with intellectual disabilities and psychotic illnesses and elderly people who are inappropriately placed in psychiatric homes. Does the Department have plans to overcome these difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does. Approximately 300 patients with intellectual disabilities, excluding those in St. Joseph's special unit in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, currently reside in public psychiatric facilities. Initiatives are well advanced throughout the country, particularly in Limerick, Killarney and Kilkenny, to provide these patients with alternative accommodation. Similar initiatives are being pursued in Wexford and Tipperary. The national development plan provides us with the wherewithal to carry out these developments which will result in the appropriate placement of people with intellectual disabilities. I accept the Deputy's point about elderly people requiring geriatric care.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will contract private orthodontists to provide treatment for children in view of the large waiting lists for treatment nationally.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24520/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. At present, there are significant waiting lists and waiting times for the provision of orthodontic treatment. There are currently more than 18,000 children on the assessment waiting lists and 12,000 on the treatment waiting lists, with a waiting time for treatment of between two and five years. However, treatment of the most severe cases commences straight away.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the orthodontic services carried out by health boards in 1998 &ndash; the Moran report &ndash; structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. A grade of specialist in orthodontics will be introduced following completion of negotiations under the Health Service Employers Agency. Efforts are being made to progress with the relevant authorities the putting in place of training programmes for dentists working in the regional units to allow them to reach specialist level. My Department has approached the Dental Council concerning the recognition of a new grade of auxiliary dental worker in orthodontics. I hope these structural changes, when fully on stream, will allow target service levels to be achieved.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I have been considering a special initiative on the orthodontic waiting lists. Under this initiative, it would be open to health boards to contract the services of private orthodontists at approved rates. The effect of the initiative would be to increase the numbers in treatment and significantly reduce waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some children in need of orthodontic treatment do not want to attend school or socialise with other children? This is a national scandal. I question the Minister's figures because there were 24,000 people on the waiting lists in October 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government and the health boards have failed to resolve this crisis. Will the Government consider providing direct grant aid to families to allow them to obtain private orthodontic treatment for their children? It is not acceptable that children will not go out to play and are constantly crying because they are self-conscious.</P>
      <P>We have listened to the Minister speaking about various reports and initiatives, yet nothing has happened and the situation in the health services is deteriorating. Earlier, Deputy Mitchell spoke about waiting lists to get on to waiting lists for orthodontic treatment. There are problems with staff. A number of years ago the Department looked to Sweden for staff, and now the situation is getting worse. Would the Government consider giving grant aid to parents to deal with the problem, at least until the waiting lists are dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not considering giving grants <Col N="248" /> to parents or families to procure orthodontic services. However, I will shortly announce a special initiative for the orthodontic waiting list. I am not happy with the length of the waiting lists, but they have existed for a long time and we have had many difficulties in certain health boards, including in terms of personnel, which have exacerbated the situation. Additional investment is also required.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question spoke about whether health boards could contract private orthodontists. Some health boards are doing that and that option will be available to health boards throughout the country. It is important that we build up public sector capacity in the orthodontic service, which means an increase in the number of specialists. Doing that has been delayed in terms of discussions with the Health Services Employers' Agency and working out a deal. It will result in more consultant appointments in certain health boards. We have already approved a significant plan for the ERHA area and are doing the same in the Southern Health Board area, the areas with the largest orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I am determined that over the next 12 months there will be a very significant reduction in the waiting times for children awaiting these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been tried in the past has not worked. In the Western Health Board area the waiting list time has increased from two to five years. In four years the numbers on the list have increased from 1,376 to 4,500. It is a serious crisis and we need thinkers, real action and a commitment from the Minister. I also ask the Minister to stop the wits in the health boards telling parents that people in need of the orthodontic service can be treated up to the age of 75. That is a disgraceful answer which I and parents find insulting. The Minister should write to the chief executive officers of all the health boards to ask them to stop giving that outrageous and ridiculous answer.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us what he will do about this very serious problem?</P>

      <Quest>the total number of beds available in the new Tallaght Hospital by comparison to the total number of beds that were available in the four constituent hospitals in existence prior to the inception of Tallaght Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the new public hospital at Tallaght opened on 21 June 1998. The hospital incorporates the activities of the former Adelaide, Meath and National Children's Hospitals and includes certain services from St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital. Prior to the transfer of services to Tallaght the three acute general hospitals had a total of 534 hospital beds designated under the Health (In-patient services) Regulations 1991. The hospital currently has a total of 464 designated hospital beds and when it opened it also had access to 35 dedicated step-down beds in the old Meath Hospital. There are also 56 acute psychiatric beds on the campus which transferred from St. Loman's Hospital. In addition, I understand the hospital has recently completed the development of a private wing with 75 beds which brings the total number of acute beds at the hospital equal to that number which were operational at the base hospitals.</P>
      <P>The reduction in bed numbers was planned because it had been observed in the planning of the new hospital at Tallaght that there was an increasing demand for out-patient and day care services in the base hospitals, and the design of the new hospital reflected this need by providing more day care beds and less in-patient beds.</P>
      <P>Additional step-down beds will be available to the hospital this year. As part of the winter initiative which I announced recently, the ERHA will have access to an additional 495 beds by the end of March 2001.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. This review is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I have presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of short to medium term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second phase of the bed review is now under way and will involve the development of a <Col N="250" /> longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The review will also involve a more detailed assessment of need, including an analysis of future bed requirements by speciality. I anticipate that the review will be completed in Spring 2001.</P>

      <P>This year I made an additional £0.25 million available to the Southern Health Board for the further development of its orthodontic services. This funding has enabled the board to undertake a number of initiatives as follows: opening of four additional dental chairs in the orthodontic unit at St. Finbarr's Hospital which will bring the total number of chairs there to ten &ndash; this will substantially increase the capacity of the unit; upgrading the computer system in order to provide accurate and timely information and speed up the processing of appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also undertaken to provide additional funding of £0.1 million to the Dental School next year to assist the school in the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics <Col N="253" /> which will be open to health board dentists working in the regional orthodontic units.</P>
    <P>The geographical distribution of children on the waiting list will only be accurately known on completion of the waiting list validation. The board will then be better situated to evaluate the service needs of the Kerry area.</P>
    <P>At my invitation the board has submitted proposals to my Department to significantly reduce orthodontic waiting lists as part of my proposed initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The board's proposals include: the appointment of an additional consultant orthodontist based in St. Finbarr's Hospital; the appointment of an orthodontist with specialist qualifications based in Tralee; development of a new orthodontic unit in Tralee; the recruitment of four additional dental teams with secretarial and radiographer support in the Cork unit; the recruitment of two additional dental teams and secretarial and radiographer support for the Kerry area.</P>
    <P>I will respond shortly to the board on these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Minister does not have the figures there are 1,073 young people awaiting orthodontic treatment in Kerry. Will he accept for a county the size of Kerry that such a waiting list in unacceptable? It is unacceptable that teenagers should have to wait three and a half years for a basic service. Can the Minister give a time frame for the appointment of a specialist orthodontist for Kerry to alleviate the growing waiting list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's concerns about the orthodontic service in the Southern Health Board area. There have been difficulties there over several years which have allowed the build-up of the back log currently being experienced. I asked the board to present proposals to me. I made it clear to the board and to every other health board that I wanted realistic proposals which would have a measurable impact in as short a time as possible on the waiting lists and on the waiting times in particular. The health board has made a substantial proposal. I have, more or less, considered the various submissions made and I hope in the next few weeks to be in a position to make a definitive response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there are 10,000 patients awaiting assessment in the clinic in Cork? Is he aware that the consultant orthodontist has said the service is in danger of collapse? Will he agree there are parents whose children are suffering needlessly because of the lack of a response from his Department on this issue? Is there empire building going on in the Department where this is concerned? Will the Minister intervene in a hands-on fashion? There are parents who, having waited for years, are told their child's problem is not bad enough to warrant treatment. They have to pay thousands of pounds <Col N="254" /> for this treatment which should be provided by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking a hands-on approach to the orthodontic service and particularly in respect of the difficulties in the Southern Health Board area and in the ERHA. Let us be straight, it is not all about funding. There are very strange relationships between key players in the provision of orthodontic services and the patient and the punter has suffered as a result. I will not stand for that. I will make alternative arrangements that will ensure we build up the capacity and that people get the service to which they are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring to the Minister's previous reply, will he confirm that he will appoint a specialist orthodontist in Kerry to serve five days a week to reduce the waiting list fivefold? The current consultant orthodontist visits Kerry one day per week. A permanent specialist orthodontist in Tralee would reduce the waiting list fivefold and would rectify the problem. Will he confirm that he will make such an appointment &ndash; as one decent Kerryman to a Corkman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the Minister's response to the fact that a senior orthodontist in the Southern Health Board felt obliged to write a letter to the editor of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> outlining his grave disquiet at the service in the region? In relation to promised reviews will they include a review of the classification of patients? We are all aware of dozens of constituents whose parents consider they should receive orthodontic treatment. They are refused placement on the list on the basis that the treatment is cosmetic rather than medical. Will the reviews take that into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>New guidelines which emanated from the Moran report in terms of the classification of people who may be treated or go on the waiting list are being considered by the boards. I have been advised that those guidelines will involve a broadening of the spectrum of people who will be entitled to treatment. I am aware of the concerns. I caution that we will have to be realistic, given the size of the existing lists. They are the priority. Obviously we will have to prioritise the treatments in order of the acute nature of the conditions, in other words, those in greatest need will have to get the service more quickly. I do not want to comment on individuals or individuals writing to newspapers. That is not appropriate. It would not be appropriate use of the House for the debate in which I would like to engage. It is not all about the responsibility of Government or health boards. Everyone has a collective role. There has been a lack of consensus between the key players both within that <Col N="255" /> health board and in other health boards as to how best the orthodontic service should develop. There have been many rows and much conflict about training and accreditation. Meanwhile Rome was burning, in terms of the lack of movement on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a grade at which orthodontists can be employed by health boards? Is his Department refusing to sanction the appointment of orthodontists who are not consultants? Why was it that dentists who were working under the supervision of the consultant orthodontist in Cork to do this work were stopped from doing so by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not happen. That is not accurate. There was a training accreditation issue that emerged before my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not changed. There is a big history and the issue is not black and white. One of the reasons we are appointing a professor of orthodontics to the dental school is that that issue had been raised by the individual consultant and others concerned. As soon as I had given sanction to the health board a difficulty arose, but I have no criticism of that. Everyone involved has to genuinely engage in a consensus approach and unfortunately the people are poles apart. I cannot hang around for people to mend their past conflicts. Hopefully, we will bring to a conclusion discussions with the HSEA on conditions and so on for specialist orthodontists who will be employed and will help to reduce the waiting lists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>During and since the weekend my Department has been in contact with the relevant local authorities to obtain up-to-date information regarding the flooding and has monitored the position on an ongoing basis by obtaining regular updates from the relevant county and city managers. Both the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and myself have been kept fully informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> The worst weather conditions were experienced along the east and south east coasts. Reports from the relevant local authorities this morning suggest that although the situation is still bad in some areas it seems the worst is over and in most cases flood levels are receding. However, severe flooding problems have subsequently manifested themselves in Carlow. Many roads which were closed are now passable and people have returned to some houses and business premises which were evacuated.</P>
    <P>The matter was considered at Cabinet this morning and as Members may be aware the Government has agreed to implement a humanitarian relief programme. A package of measures will be announced next week following consultation with the Office of Public Works, my Department and the local authorities. Local authorities in the areas worst affected activated their major emergency plans, in some cases as early as Sunday afternoon. This resulted in all the emergency services co-operating to limit and relieve the effects of flooding. The Garda Síochána, local authorities, Army, Civil Defence and health services are the main players. Local authority work forces are diverted to flood relief works, 24-hour monitoring of the situation is installed and the media are fully briefed. From the information provided, it is clear that local authorities in conjunction with the other emergency services, are using every available resource to deal with this current flooding crisis.</P>
    <P>The Department continuously reviews its guidelines for major emergency management &ndash; in consultation, where necessary, with other Departments with responsibilities in this area &ndash; through the interdepartmental advisory committee on major emergencies. My Department chairs the committee which is an advisory body only, composed of representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Defence. The committee discusses problems arising in emergency planning and issues advice and guidance as necessary to the main response agencies, the local authorities, including fire brigades, health boards, and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I propose to invite representatives from other relevant Departments to discuss the lessons learned from the current flooding and to revise major emergency management arrangements where it is deemed appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the extent of the devastation that has been inflicted on some communities? Last night in Enniscorthy there were three cars on the quay of which only the aerials were visible. One particular house was in 12 feet of water. Will the Minister of State give details of this humanitarian aid package? Does he have a plan whereby local authorities will give an assessment of damage to bridges, road surfaces, footpaths and amenity walkways? Will money be <Col N="260" /> made available to restore those areas arising out of the flood damage? Will the Minister of State expand the special housing aids for the elderly or other cash aid schemes for householders who were put out of their homes before 5 o'clock on Monday morning? They are homeless and face the desperate prospect of trying to remove debris from their houses. Is the Minister of State saying that there will be money for those householders in the package to which he has referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as aware as anyone can be who has not had the opportunity to visit every area where flooding has caused such devastation. As I said in my reply, I am familiar with the reports that have been made to the Department from the various local authority managements throughout the country, which have constantly kept the Department updated. It is quite clear from media reports and the individual reports of county managers that a very serious situation has arisen for a substantial number of people around the country.</P>
      <P>The Government is working out the details of a humanitarian aid package and will be announcing those details as soon as possible. All aspects of the situation will be taken into consideration. Local authorities are being asked to assess the situation in their areas. Naturally, bridges and other physical structures which were in the path of strong flood water currents will have to be inspected to ensure they are safe for the public. All those matters will form part of the review, in addition to the position of individuals who have suffered grievously because of the damage to their homes. All these aspects will be factored into the consideration and the Government's response will be made on humanitarian grounds.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the aid package the Government approved this morning. Has the Government approved an amount for that aid package and, if so, what is it? What will be covered by that special aid package and what will qualify for it? Does the Minister agree that unlike some of the weather occurrences we have seen in recent years, this storm did not happen suddenly? In view of the fact that it was forecast for the best part of a week, will the Minister explain why the country virtually ground to a halt because of the rain and the storm? Specifically, what action was taken by local authorities and public utilities to prevent flooding from taking place, to release water courses and to ensure drains were open and operating? The Minister referred to contact between him and local authorities over the weekend and since then. Was there contact between him, his Department and local authorities in the period preceding the bad weather, during which time it was forecast? What steps can be taken to ensure that we will not find ourselves again in a situation where trains do not run, the main roads are blocked and people can<Col N="261" /> not get to work every time there is a bad spell of weather?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there could not possibly be an amount agreed at this stage, nor can details be given as to what might or might not be covered. That will depend on reports coming back from local authorities after the waters have, I hope, receded and there will be an opportunity to assess the damage to property and the hardship caused to many families. All that information will be required before one can make an assessment. The Government will be generous in this matter and it recognises the hardship that individual families are suffering.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about contacts with local authorities. The Meteorological Office issued a warning on Saturday, 4 November, at 8 p.m. to all relevant local authorities in Munster and Leinster, advising them that they could expect between 40mm and 60mm of rainfall from 6 a.m. on Sunday to 6 a.m. on Monday. We cannot jump in and look in hindsight at where the water came from. I understand that in some cases the flooding emerged from unexpected quarters where it had not arisen during previous floods. In other places, of course, it would have been easy to anticipate where difficulties might arise. It was not expected, for instance, that Carlow would suffer from serious flooding last night or this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>That has come late in the day. Hindsight will not help us in this case. Where floods alleviating schemes have been undertaken by the Office of Public Works it seems there has not been any great problem. Many other schemes in the planning stage have not yet been completed. We all have our opinions as to what might be causing these weather patterns, including climatic change, but we will have to have more extensive planning to deal with more severe rainfall in future. The recent Planning Bill authorises local authorities to refuse planning permission where they consider that a building is to be erected on a flood plain. The Government will assess all the reports which county managers have been asked to supervise as soon as they have had an opportunity to complete them. Then the Government will announce in detail what it will do.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister received any figure on the cost of the recent storm, apart from what he might read in the <i>Evening Herald</i>? Will he give an indication of the extent of the disruption? According to the Small Business Association, a number of firms will no longer be viable and will have lost too much to be able to continue. Is the Minister aware that increasingly people cannot obtain insurance cover for flood damage because of the damage caused in the recent past? Will the Minister state not his <Col N="262" /> opinion but his understanding &ndash; as a Minister with the best scientific information available to him, we assume &ndash; of the connection between the emerging patterns of extreme weather and global climate change? Will he be offering more than advice and guidance, as he said in his reply, arising from the interdepartmental committee? Will he give figures for how much he is prepared to invest in emergency services and additional planning and engineering staff in local authorities so that there will be prevention of rather than cure for such incidents in future?</P>

        <b>:</b> While welcoming the announcement of the Minister of State and the Government, it is important to impress upon him the need to have County Wexford, especially, as Deputy Yates said, Enniscorthy town, included. We did not receive the same prominence on television as other areas although we were probably much worse than them. Unfortunately, lazy RTE did not bother visiting us in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the moneys or grants the Minister of State will announce next week be paid directly to the people who suffered major losses as a result of the floods in Enniscorthy? Will he make funds available for the provision of flow bars for the people along the River Slaney in Enniscorthy? The final question and the most important point for people in Enniscorthy at present is whether the Minister of State will ensure local authorities will place every avenue at the disposal of the local people to get them back into their homes and <Col N="263" /> help them clean up the area, and that they will make transport available to take away the obsolete furniture, carpets and dishwashers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of the effect of the flooding in Enniscorthy where a bridge was under six foot of water, where the river bank and roadways collapsed and 40 families were evacuated and placed in bed and breakfast accommodation under the emergency provisions. I assure the Deputy that the assessment sent to the Department by Wexford local authority officials will form part of whatever package the Government agrees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that hydrological studies should be conducted in the planning of new housing estates to ensure that houses are not being located on flood plains and to assess the effect of cementing over an area which previously absorbed water and of diverting water to other areas, thereby creating flooding? Is he satisfied that local authorities have adequate hydrological and hydrographical expertise available to them when deciding, for example, on zoning large areas for housing to assure them that they are zoning them in the proper place for housing and that they are not in places where they will be either flooded themselves or will lead to flooding for others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton. It is specifically provided for in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which was passed recently. In future, local authorities will be able to refuse permission in an area subject to a restriction in its development plan because it lies in a flood risk area. The hydrological expertise is available within the country to assess that aspect of potential sites. It will be a critical factor in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that, on the very day Dunboyne was flooded, the council rezoned 170 acres around Dunboyne for housing? Did it have adequate hydrological expertise to know that it was not rezoning land for housing which may aggravate flooding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of whatever decision it made on zoning, it will still have to obtain planning permission and go through the process of public consultation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that new housing development exacerbates the situation because it concentrates the flow of water and this adds to the flow going into local streams and rivers which quickly swell and spread, leading to a crisis. We have ample evidence this week of the results of improper planning, and the risk of flooding will have to become an essential and important part <Col N="264" /> of the consideration of planning permissions in future. That is provided for in the new Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware that parts of County Wicklow were devastated by flooding, especially the town of Arklow, and that people are still out of home as a consequence. Will the Minister of State ensure that staff from his Department will meet the urban district council and health board in Arklow to ensure an accurate assessment is made of the financial requirements? Obviously they extend from repairs to temporary accommodation needs. Will he fast-track as far as possible the Arklow sewerage scheme which would provide an upgraded drainage system for the town, which is badly needed?</P>
      <P>Will the Government seriously consider increasing the number of outdoor staff in local authorities to ensure high quality maintenance on an ongoing basis? This would clearly help in future when similar crises occur. The shortage of outdoor staff has certainly added to the difficulties experienced in keeping drains open and ensuring a proper run-off of water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred specifically to the Arklow sewerage scheme. I will be happy to communicate with her on that and on any way it can be expedited. I am not sure what the difficulties might be. If it can be expedited, I will try to ensure that happens.</P>
      <P>In regard to consultation, local authorities have access to all the information, they know who is responsible for the different services provided and they will be charged with submitting the reports to the Department. We will liaise with local authority officials regarding the situation in each area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is also aware that north County Dublin was affected by floods. It is appropriate we pay tribute to the outdoor staff of the councils and fire services and the Garda who worked ceaselessly to try to rescue people and alleviate the suffering. Will he give an assurance to the House that, whatever the grant package given, the method of drawing money from it will be as simple as possible so that people are not waiting months to receive compensation? The Minister of State has not yet given us a figure for the fund.</P>
      <P>Will an opportunity be included in that fund for county councils to make a claim to carry out works on known places? I could have written down where the floods were going to happen on certain parts of the N1 because work remains outstanding. Will these be included in the Minister of State's package so that we can attempt to prevent this type of flooding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What discussions will the Minister of State have with the National Roads Authority about the fact that roads built in the recent past were <Col N="265" /> flooded? The main artery roads were cut off and closed because of flooding and these were built with the highest expertise and cost vast amounts of money. The N1 at Blake's Cross is an example but the position is similar for many motorways throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some experience of flooding and the procedures we put in place to try to help those who suffered because of it. I refer specifically to the south Galway experience where I was very much involved with the local community. I understand the frustration people suffered in trying to avail of the package made available. I am conscious of the need that it be simple and clearly understood and that there would not be any undue delay in meeting legitimate claims. I am aware that we are dealing with public money and that one must be careful regarding what is and what is not approved. One cannot be cavalier in the way one makes these decisions. This will be dealt with in a proper fashion.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority will be asked what happened in regard to the serious flooding which occurred on the main arteries and national primary routes for which it is responsible. I had personal experience of what happened on the N4 at Maynooth, where, for some extraordinary reason, traffic on that national route could not pass under a certain bridge and was diverted to the old road, which had served us for hundreds of years and was bone dry and passable. That caused an enormous back up of traffic. It took some people three or four hours to travel from Kilcock to Maynooth. It took over an hour to travel from the motorway into Kilcock, a journey of about a mile.</P>
      <P>There are many questions which need to be answered. A full assessment will be carried out and, hopefully, proper action will be taken. Efforts are being made to clear the floods and we are bringing in pumping equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister of State is considering the compensation package, will he bear in the mind that many householders do not have their houses insured, due to the fact that insurance companies will not take them on? We have heard insurance companies over the past few days talking about receipts and so on but they have excluded many people. I ask the Minister of State to put those people at the top of his priority list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said he is familiar with <Col N="266" /> the situation in south Galway, where people were rehoused. While I appreciate it is impossible to rehouse everybody whose house has been flooded, will the Minister of State examine the feasibility of addressing the problem for people whose houses are flooded every year? They do not get publicity but the houses of a small number of people were flooded last year and the year before.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State agree that, due to increased reclamation of land and improved drainage facilities by the agricultural community, rivers are inclined to flood at a faster rate? To the best of my knowledge, the Office of Public Works is responsible for only two rivers, the Shannon and the Barrow. The Slaney basin, for example, goes through Wicklow, Carlow and Wexford&mdash;</P>

Is the package to which he referred a package for householders whose houses have been badly damaged from flooding and who do not have insurance? How quickly can they get access to that fund?

      <P>Thank you for your latitude on this important matter, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Would the Minister consider it appropriate to organise an audit of bridges in every local authority area? The system for funding bridges is most unsatisfactory. We have been told there is no national funding to rebuild the four bridges in my constituency. The fact that four bridges in my constituency remain down does not sit well with a national development plan to spend in excess of £40 billion on infrastructure. Does the Minister of State recall a celebrated occasion in 1996 when the Taoiseach spent some time amid a fanfare of publicity in the town of Clonmel with the Minister of State, Deputy Davern? Various promises and commitments were made to the people of Clonmel that the flooding which occurred in 1996 would not be seen again. That is a broken promise on the part of the Taoiseach.</P>

        <b>:</b> For almost five years a flood alleviation plan for Carlow has been in the process of production. It started with consultants' reports which were not acceptable to the experts in the Office of Public Works. They agreed to make a model of the river Barrow as it flowed through Carlow to test the plan. Carlow is now flooded for the second time. The Minister of State saw Carlow at its best a few nights ago and I am aware that he has its best interests at heart. Will he contact the experts who are playing with this Meccano set and ask them to do something to prevent flooding next year in Carlow?</P>

      <P>We will have to wait for another day for the response of this humanitarian Government to the needs of people. Will the Minister of State acknowledge that the fire brigades and local authorities have been working around the clock and are to be complimented on their work? In north County Dublin, council staff were put to the pin of their collars to keep the national roads open while hundreds of secondary roads, houses and farms were cut off. How is it <Col N="270" /> that the Army, the FCA and the Civil Defence were not brought in to complement the efforts of local authority workers in north County Dublin? In addition, why was it yesterday afternoon that we were informed the co-ordinated emergency plan for the greater Dublin area was being put in place, 24 hours after the worst parts of this storm? The Minister of State must take responsibility for these shortcomings in the system.</P>

      <P>Last week there was a similar situation in Britain which should have forewarned us of the potential for damage in this country. Is the Minister of State aware of the River Poddle in Kimmage and that every time there is heavy rain the river flows down the middle of the road into people's homes? That is easily prevented. There is a grating to prevent children being swept underground but it gets blocked with bottles and other litter. Will the Minister of State arrange for each local authority to compile a catalogue of flashpoints to which they should attend when heavy rainfall occurs? In many cases, certainly in Kimmage, that would prevent the problem. Yesterday, my constituents had to watch the river flowing up the middle of the road and into their gardens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies raised a number of matters. With regard to an audit of bridges, I assume that will be an essential part of the report. Bridges which were in the flood paths should be looked at to ensure they are in a safe condition for continued public use.</P>
      <P>I was in Carlow for a more pleasant occasion last week and I admired the wonderful work people are doing in establishing Carlow county's floral pride. The Carlow town flood alleviation scheme will be ready for statutory exhibition early in the new year. The Office of Public Works has done a tremendous amount of work throughout the country drawing up such schemes. These were discussed by local authorities but the proposals were not always agreed to. Further consideration was given to them and in some cases two or three different plans were put before the members after they asked for changes.</P>
      <P>Having seen the extent of the havoc that can be visited on people and their homes, hopefully there will be more urgency in the process and minds can be brought together to reach final decisions. This will enable the Office of Public Works to continue its excellent work. Where it has gone ahead and completed schemes there has been practically no recurrence of serious flooding. There are solutions and they require funding. The Government has provided a substantial amount of funding but all of it has not yet been used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my first reply I paid tribute, as I do again now, to the extent of the activity of the fire brigades, the Garda Síochána, the Civil Defence, the Army and the local authority officials who responded magnificently to this emergency. They are due the sincere thanks of every Member of <Col N="271" /> the House and I express that now. In terrible conditions they performed magnificently. A total of 350 Army personnel produced thousands of sandbags which helped to protect many properties and great credit is due to them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gay Mitchell's point. Local authority officials should be familiar with the flashpoints and deal with them immediately when these conditions arise. That will have to be taken into consideration more seriously in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that the old adage applies in Athy &ndash; there is water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink. All pumping stations in the town were turned off due to their proximity to the River Barrow and the local authority's fear of pollution of the water supply. This has been a feature of flooding in Athy for a number of years. Will the Minister of State's Department examine the funding for the south Kildare water scheme? There is another problem with the River Barrow because Kilmoroney Bridge is now hanging into the river. It is backing the water into Athy and I have no wish to deprive Deputy Browne of all that water. It should be allowed to flow into Carlow where he can deal with it. Every effort should be made to remove Kilmoroney Bridge and to deal with the flooding in Athy.</P>

Compensation for damage done is what is sought.</P>
      <P>On the broader front, will the Minister of State indicate what he and his ministerial colleagues are doing at international level in terms of discussing climate changes with their EU colleagues? The Minister of State has not addressed the questions raised by Deputy Sargent. The only suggestion he made to address this problem is that people should build houses on hills. We are re-hashing the debate that took place in Britain last week. What are we doing internationally to discuss the question of climate change?

What compensation will be given to the people who have been waiting for the past ten years for local improvement scheme grants to improve road access to their houses in which they were marooned for weeks on end at the time of previous floods?

    </Speaker>
    <P>When I entered politics Michael Pat Murphy <Col N="275" /> was a senior figure in the Labour Party, a very much admired and beloved figure. Deputy Sheehan has inherited some of his characteristics, his colourful turn of phrase and his sheer physical dominance in a debate.</P>
    <P>Michael Pat Murphy was the epitome of the role played by a rural Labour Deputy at that time. He was particularly vociferous in articulating the needs of people whom he felt were not properly represented by the establishment, those who were neglected by the Government of the day. He had a strong and passionate commitment to ordinary people whom he felt had been left behind in the development of freedom. I greatly admired the way he could argue his case in public and in the privacy of the Labour Party Parliamentary Party.</P>
    <P>I met him on a number of occasions between 1973 and 1977 when he was Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Agriculture, subsequently the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I recall his passionate commitment to the lives and livelihoods of the inshore fishermen not only in part of his constituency but throughout the country. He will be renowned for the way in which he dealt with a number of difficult issues, particularly that concerning resolving the question of licences for salmon fishermen.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I express sympathy to his wife Hettie, his four sons, Michael Pat junior, Tim, John James, Edward Thomas, and his two daughters, Gabrielle and Kate Ann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Quinn in extending our deepest condolences to the late Michael Pat Murphy's family, particularly his wife, Hettie, and his four sons and two daughters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct in recalling that Michael Pat Murphy loyally served the people of west Cork. My memory of him here, which was during the period I was first elected to the Dáil, was fighting for the development of tourism, local investment and farming and reminding us of the distance his constituency was from the centre.</P>
      <P>His work for his constituency was broad-ranging. He and his father served on Cork County Council for a long period. Michael Pat Murphy was chairperson of it on four occasions and served on it from the late 1940s up to 1985. He was a Member of this House for 30 years. That represents tremendous public service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn said that unfortunately a great number of not only former Members who served here a long time ago but former Members whom many of us remember, have passed away this year. Many of those former Members have passed away in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While current representatives from west Cork would remind us of the distance they travel to represent their constituents, it was difficult to travel that distance to represent those constituents 30 years ago, regardless of what we say about the state of the infrastructure today. I recall the role <Col N="276" /> played by Michael Pat Murphy as Minister of State in 1973-77 Government and his pride in doing so.</P>
    <P>I extend the sympathy of the Fianna Fáil Party to our ministerial colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the death of his father-in-law, Deputy O'Donoghue's wife, Kate Ann, and the rest of Michael Pat Murphy's family. I know they will feel very proud of the tremendous service he gave to his constituency and of the contribution he made in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in expressing the sympathy of the Fine Gael party to the family of Michael Pat Murphy. I remember him most graphically in this House standing where Deputy Rabbitte is now sitting declaiming on behalf of the people of west Cork his deep and sincere commitment to those whom he represented. He really believed in social justice. His social justice was not born of ideology but of the practical knowledge of the frequently bleak lives of many people in his constituency. He was determined to use his elected office to get a better life for them. He spoke here with great force and strength. In some tributes paid to him it was said that he was a man of few words, but I do not know if that is true; he was a man who spoke clearly when he needed to speak.</P>
      <P>I remember him particularly well because he and I were appointed to ministerial office on the same day in 1973. He became Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of Agriculture while I was in another Department. He was Parliamentary Secretary to Mark Clinton and they got on very well together, as they were men of similar temperament and practicality. Mark Clinton's practicality came from his rural background in north Meath, while Michael Pat's came from Drimoleague and Schull.</P>
      <P>I also remember him for his great love of horse racing. On one occasion I followed him and Hettie as they headed to Meath. I remember asking myself what he was doing, as he was on the wrong road if he was meeting fishermen at Mornington and was headed to Navan; what possible fisheries interests could he be pursuing there? Of course, I had forgotten he was heading for Navan races. He and Hettie were very enthusiastic in following horse racing, which I know has been inherited by some if not all his family. It was a great relief and relaxation to him in his difficult work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a difficult Government to be in. We can see how easy things are now &ndash; Deputy Molloy spoke earlier about money being available for various measures and thank God that money is available. There was very little money available when Michael Pat had the job of distributing what little was available to him in his area of responsibility. Politics was tough then, but he was tough enough for the job. As the Taoiseach said, he had great physical stamina. Anyone who could travel, as he did, from his constituency for so many years &ndash; the westernmost part of the country &ndash; and <Col N="277" /> continue to serve his people so well had to have great physical as well as moral courage.</P>
    <P>I saw him in the last year or two on the streets of Schull. He enjoyed good health until relatively recently. He will be greatly missed in west Cork and by his friends in the Dáil. On behalf of Fine Gael, I pay tribute to his memory and I ask that our sympathy and that of our party and the entire House be conveyed to his widow, Hettie, whom many of us know and love, and to all the family.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and Deputies Quinn and Bruton in extending my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to the late Michael Pat Murphy's widow, Hettie, and all her family. Unlike other Members, I did not have the privilege of knowing him, but from what I know he was a very decent and honourable person. He seems to have been a great character. I am aware of his interest in horse racing and clearly that was passed on not only to the members of his family but also to his in-laws. To serve a constituency as peripheral as west Cork in the Dáil for 30 years while representing a party other than the two Civil War parties could not have been an easy achievement.</P>
      <P>I know Michael Pat Murphy had a huge personal vote and was loved across the political divide. I extend my sympathy to all his family, particularly his wife, Hettie, his daughter, Kate Ann, whom I know, and his son-in-law, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <P>I remember meeting him after I was elected to the Dáil in 1977. He was wise, had great experience and he generously passed on that wisdom. He related stories to me about the idiosyncrasies of constituents and the contrary ways in which they might convey matters. I held him in greatest affection and respect. He set very high standards <Col N="278" /> for me, Deputy Sheehan and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, because he was a very hard worker and made an exceptional impact on the constituency, even though for a large part of his time as a Deputy we did not have the communications or other facilities we have now. He certainly improved the lot of the less well off.</P>
    <P>I met a good number of people at his funeral who had come to the mainland from the islands off the coast. He was loved by the islanders and it was not because of the number of votes on the islands, but he felt they needed special attention. I can confirm that in his spare time he loved the odd punt on the horses, but he also loved the greyhounds. One met him occasionally on his way to Shelbourne Park also. I express my sympathy to his wife, Hettie, and family as well as to his son-in-law, the Minister, Deputy John O'Donoghue. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I join with other Members in expressing my deepest sympathy to Hettie Murphy, her four sons and two daughters, her son-in-law, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, her daughter-in-law, Mary, and other members of the extended family.</P>
      <P>Michael Pat Murphy had great qualities, some of the best qualities that could be found in a person entering the Dáil. He had ability, courage and dedication. He had the ability to advocate and legislate on behalf of the people. He had the courage to be his own man and to put his ideas into practice. When, in the dazzling 1960s and 1970s, the Labour Party had renowned personalities as candidates, Michael Pat kept his feet on the ground. He never put up the official Labour Party poster of the plough and the stars in his constituency; he always had his own beautiful poster printed by the <i>Southern Star</i> in ordinary black and white. The message on the poster was: &ldquo;Mind Murphy, the man who minds you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was dedicated towards helping everybody, irrespective of class, creed or political affiliation. Everyone was a friend at Michael Pat's door and he served the people of south-west Cork for 30 years, from 1951 to 1981, with diligence and pride. That seat was in the custody of the Labour Party for 28 years before Michael Pat took it over.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Labour held a seat in Cork South-West for 58 years&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;until, following Michael Pat's departure from Dáil Éireann, the mantle fell on my shoulders. It was only fitting that I should have taken over the seat, particularly in view of the fact that we lived only nine miles from each other for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Michael Pat had the distinction of being the Deputy who lived furthest from Dáil Éireann and nearest to the White House. Like me, he had nothing behind him but the Atlantic Ocean. His back was to the ocean on all occasions. In that <Col N="279" /> context, I inherited many of the drawbacks he encountered during his career.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure to work with Michael Pat on the Cork County Committee of Agriculture from 1962 to 1973 and on Cork County Council from 1967 to 1973. I also had the pleasure of working with his brother, the late Corney Murphy, who was another colourful politician from the area, and, latterly, with his son, Michael Pat Junior, who excelled as a councillor during his 11 years of service on Cork County Council. I express my sympathy to his brother, P. J. Murphy, the only member of Michael Pat's immediate family still living in Caharagh.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of seeing Michael Pat, in his capacity as chairman of Cork County Council, putting in place the final block on top of Ireland's tallest building, the County Hall in Cork, and I ensured that he laid the block properly.</P>

      <P>Michael Pat had qualities we will all miss. He was a man of the people who always put others and his country before himself. His passing will be sadly felt by everybody in the constituency.</P>
      <P>Long after he retired from the House, people went to him to seek advice on different matters. I guarantee Members that the advice he gave was infallible. He was a man of the people who represented the constituency of Cork South-West. We will all miss him in the years to come. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>The message from west Cork is clear: we were very proud of Michael Pat, we regarded him as an outstanding west Corkman, we mourn his passing and we join in the condolences to Hettie and the Murphy family.</P>
      <P>I served one term with Michael Pat in the House at a time when he was the father figure in west Cork political life. I had the opportunity during that term to bear personal testimony to his kindly disposition and benefit from his wise advice. I recall one instance when he pulled me aside when he noticed that I was making too many contributions in the Dáil. He was concerned about the local base in west Cork and he called me aside and said: &ldquo;It is fine to be speaking in the House but remember the number of people who have talked themselves out of the House.&rdquo;  He proceeded to point out the need to look after ordinary people, hold regular clinics and do the work in the constituency, and informed me that I should begin that work immediately and not wait until the run-up to the election. He told me to remember one thing: &ldquo;You never fatten the pig the night before the fair.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His advice was simple: do the work on the ground. Michael Pat did that work and he was the prototype of the hard-working Deputy. As a consequence, his circle of supporters included both rich and poor people. He made no differen<Col N="280" /> tiation in that regard, either when working for an individual or for the local community.</P>
    <P>West Cork and the country in general have lost a genuine guy. I was glad I had the opportunity to serve and work with him and to learn from him. He will long be remembered and mourned in west Cork.</P>

I understand the Government is proposing that this should be debated in the House on Thursday next for one hour. Does the Taoiseach not agree that this arrangement is entirely unsatisfactory? The report in question is very important and it will not be published until tomorrow. How is it proposed that people should give proper consideration to this matter in the time available? Furthermore, does the Taoiseach agree that the Government should table a motion on this matter indicating how it proposes to deal with the subject matter rather than merely inviting statements?</P>

He will then announce the arrangements he intends to make. I understand that because of the importance of the report there should be a debate in the House. I do not know if Deputy Bruton is suggesting that in addition to Thursday afternoon's debate there should be further deliberations on the matter. Perhaps the Whips can reach agreement in that regard. The spokespersons are to speak on the report first and if there is an argument about extending the debate perhaps it could be discussed by the Whips on Thursday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I spoke in this debate I referred to a speech by Mr. David Byrne, SC, then Attorney General and now an EU Commissioner, on 12 November 1998 which I regard as a seminal contribution to the role of the regulator. Discussing the role of the regulator he quoted Article 15.2 of the Constitution. He also referred to the 1980 case of Cityview Press<i> v.</i> An Chomhairle Ealaíon and quoted from the judgment as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the view of this court the test is whether that which is challenged as unauthorised delegation of parliamentary power is more than a mere giving effect to principles and policies which are contained in the statute itself. If it be, then it is not authorised for such would constitute a purported exercise of legislative power <Col N="287" /> by an authority, which it is not permitted to do so under the Constitution. On the other hand, if it be deemed within the permitted limits, if the laws laid down in the statute and details only are filled in or completed by the designate Minister or subordinate body, there is no unauthorised delegation of legislative power.</P>
    <P>Mr. Byrne went on to comment on this when he stated:</P>
    <P>The idea that regulators only fill in details may sound odd to the ears of those regulators who know the huge care for labour intensive specialist consideration which their jobs require them to give to their decisions and, indeed, the great social and commercial importance those decisions may have. However, that is the accurate statement of the relationship between their tasks and the task of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>After this the Minister embarked on what appeared to be a consultation on the role of the regulator in the different areas over which she had some jurisdiction and for which she has responsibility.</P>
    <P>However, many, including the Labour Party, made a submission to the consultative process on the accountability of regulators. The Minister in turn produced a Green Paper, but what is extraordinary is the way she is proceeding with the delegation of powers in an imprecise way and without even having addressed the considerations that arise in her Green Paper. If she was determined to establish regulatory bodies, regulators or whatever else, and in removing matters from the strict accountability of the State then, as required by the Constitution, she should have established where the accountability lay before she piecemeal and willy-nilly appeared to violate some of the submissions in the Green Paper that appear to have been accepted by her.</P>
    <P>The Minister may respond by saying she will legislate in time to cover these aspects. That will not work. For example, section 38(1) states that &ldquo;A person shall not question the validity of a determination or a request of the Commission under this Part otherwise than by way of an application for leave to apply for judicial review under Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts&rdquo;. The then Attorney General, Mr. Byrne, addressed this point by stating that the judicial review is only one of the measures by which you could apply accountability. He went on to state correctly that judicial review can only deal with matters of procedure within narrow limits as to how, in fact, a particular decision has been taken.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper was a very important contribution to the debate on what should be the mechanism under the Constitution for transferring accountably to new sub-legislative bodies. The view across other jurisdictions, reviewed by writers other than Mr. Byrne, is that it can probably be best and safely done when a clear policy mandate is given to the regulator. It may then be said, in terms of the case referred to by Mr. Byrne, that <Col N="288" /> under Article 15 of the Constitution, the regulator is filling in the details.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister is not doing that, what seems to inform her thinking in this legislation and in other areas is that liberalisation of the market is the primary intention of the legislation. If that is the case where does accountability lie? Whenever there is a difficulty the Minister will wring her hands, as she has so often done in the House, and say the regulator is independent. I call on her to explain in what sense the regulator is independent. Is he independent in filling the detail of a policy function or is he independent in a policy sense?</P>
    <P>When this issue was debated in the British House of Commons, those affected by these kinds decisions told its select committee on trade and industry &ndash; in this case the evidence of the United Kingdom Electricity Association &ndash; that they would prefer if the role of the regulator was more clearly specified. The Minister is doing her classic huff and puff act. She has a Green Paper on regulation, accountably, the role of the regulator, etc. Meanwhile she introduces legislation on aviation, electricity or whatever else.</P>
    <P>This Bill flies close to the wind in terms of constitutional acceptability. It is difficult to see how it complies with the terms of Article 15 of the Constitution. Only somebody who was not well informed on what was required by European regulation would confuse the establishment of competition on the one hand with the destruction of State involvement on the other. The Minister's intention is interesting. I do not attribute any malevolence to her but I do attribute considerable deep ignorance. The idea that one can create competition and a liberal competitive involvement by destroying the State or its agencies is deeply ignorant as is that idea that if one knocks those out, everything else will fall into place and the consumer will be better served. Consumers are also citizens and, as such, they have rights under the Constitution. Voters are entitled to be protected by the Constitution. Where is the Minister meeting the norm of accountability? If she says judicial process will meet that end, what has she to say about the comments made by the former Attorney General, who served in a Government of which she was a member, to the effect that judicial review is limited in regard to what it can provide by way of accountability? Perhaps we live in an era where people have very little interest in respecting citizens' rights to accountability. In some jurisdictions, rabid, neo-liberal free marketeers suggest that anything which the state touches is wrong. At least, they have the merit of being up-front. The Minister is proceeding with pieces of legislation in regard to State sectors of activity which have been patiently built up with public investment but is not announcing what principles will guide her. Commissioner Byrne, former Attorney General, in page 14 of his paper states:</P>
    <P>Delegation of authority must be done in a detailed and precise manner. The exact remit <Col N="289" /> of any regulator must be clear and obvious to all those who will be affected by their activities. A coherent policy framework, formulated by the Executive and the Legislature, within which the regulator is required to make decisions, must be set out.</P>
    <P>Where is that policy framework? Will the Minister outline it in her reply to this debate? This legislation, which is bad in principle and constitutionally frail, is a very poor response to the very fine contribution of the Minister's former Government colleague.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated in her Second Stage speech that she shared the concerns of some people about giving over huge segments of public activity to newly formed independent agencies. She further stated that if we were merely to transfer power without accountability, there would clearly be a democratic deficit. The Minister believes that issues of transparency, independence and accountability constitute a prominent feature of this legislation and Members would welcome that.</P>
      <P>I take on board Deputy Higgins's comments. As legislators, we must be very clear about what we do in regard to transparency and accountability in this Bill because we will have many more Bills along these lines. I would like to obtain greater clarification about some of the issues which arise in regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill will result in the establishment of a new regulatory body which will be known as the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The commission will regulate the charges levied at Irish airports by Aer Rianta and the Irish Aviation Authority in respect of services rendered to aircraft for take-off and approach. Will the Minister or Minister of State update the House on the implementation of the directive on ground handling which allows for free access for suppliers of ground handling services? The Minister will be aware that employees at Dublin Airport expressed concern that no minimum standards were proposed with regard to procedures, equipment, training etc. in the context of the directive. This anxiety was conveyed to the Minister by SIPTU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, among others. The Minister previously informed the House that she believed these were matters for the airlines themselves to resolve, together with the relevant regulatory agencies such as the Irish Aviation Authority, the Health and Safety Authority, the Environmental Protection Agency, the health boards and Aer Rianta itself. Is the Minister satisfied that the ground handling safety regulation is adequate at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the difficulties which have arisen at Dublin Airport, particularly those which arose during the summer months. Passengers and <Col N="290" /> members of the public have complained about the serious congestion which occurs at the airport and the issue of public safety became a real concern earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Unprecedented levels of economic growth have resulted in a large increase in passenger and flight numbers. Aer Rianta will deal with more than 14 million passengers this year and will operate in excess of 550 flights on peak days. This volume of passengers and flights should have been planned for long before now. I welcome the fact that Aer Rianta has a development plan for the airport which will see the space and facilities for airlines and passengers being doubled in a new terminal extension. Some 58 airline check-in desks are planned and the number of baggage reclaim belts has increased from five to ten. Additional entrances and exits, together with new lifts and escalators, are also being put in place. The public must be assured that adequate planning is under way and that public safety is not being compromised.</P>
    <P>Aircraft arrival and departure times must be controlled and flights must be co-ordinated to ensure ground handling facilities are available. The Minister recently announced the appointment of an independent slots co-ordinator for the airport with a view to bringing about full co-ordination. This appointment, although overdue, is to be welcomed. Hopefully, airport users will see an improvement in the airport in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <P>I want to raise an issue which is of particular relevance to my constituency, namely airport noise. An increase in passenger and flight numbers has resulted in increasing levels of airport noise which, at times, is almost unbearable for people living in the vicinity of the airport. Last year, work on a rapid exit taxiway required the closure of the main runway and the use of a secondary runway at night. This caused major headaches for residents in the Beaumont and Santry areas, among others. The work was not completed on schedule and Aer Rianta did little or nothing to appease local residents, nor did it explain to them why this intolerable noise was being visited upon them.</P>
    <P>We must examine the EU regulations in regard to aircraft noise over built-up residential areas. These are Council Directives 92/14/EC and 98/20/EC, Commission Directive 1999/28/EC and EC Council Regulation 925/1999. The view of many of my constituents is that these are not enough as the problem seems to be getting worse. It may be that the EU directive on urban noise now proposed might bring some relief. A proposal for an EU directive relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise is being considered by the EU Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Unprecedented economic growth has resulted in a major increase in urban noise, especially in the vicinity of Dublin Airport and the M1 motorway. This new proposal recognises for the first time that such noise is a major <Col N="291" /> problem. Member states will be obliged to set up procedures to make noise maps of urban areas and of major transport facilities such as airports, roads etc. Action plans to reduce noise levels must also be prepared. This initiative would be welcomed by communities everywhere, particularly in north Dublin given the increasing calls for action in relation to noise. I call for the implementation of the proposed EU directive in the shortest possible timeframe.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is happening Aer Rianta's consultancy study which will propose a new noise management strategy, including the provision of noise monitoring at Dublin Airport. Earlier this year the Minister informed the House of this new strategy. Has it been completed, what does it involve and when will it be implemented?</P>
    <P>This is a new problem which is becoming very serious for many residents who live in the vicinity of airports. I do not think the legislation promulgated at EU level is adequate. We must do more in this regard.</P>
    <P>I noted what the Minister said in her speech on Second Stage in relation to airport charges in general, the issues which arise as a result of liberalisation of air services and strong economic growth. I also noted what she said in relation to the potential for conflict between the shareholder and regulatory roles, and she has got the balance right in the legislation.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which we must address in the overall context of discussion on Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, but it would not be appropriate to raise them in the context of this Bill. These include the future of Aer Rianta and the airports in general. There is much discussion among employees on this matter. The Minister has commissioned studies on the matter and is giving the issue careful consideration. Another related issue is pensions for retired staff of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. These pensions have fallen way behind the pensions of other semi-State employees and this must be addressed in the context of the discussion of the future of both companies.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised. I again stress the need for clarification in relation to accountability and transparency. This will be the first of many Bills which will be presented to the House by the Department of Public Enterprise. On Committee Stage we will have to tease it out carefully, establish where we are going and ensure that adequate mechanisms are in place and that what we are doing is clearly understood by all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I welcome the Bill. It is good that we have commissions or regulators overseeing and regulating many of the functions in need of regulation. However, I join with my colleagues in raising the accountability of regulators. Increasingly the Ceann Comhairle tells us that Ministers have no responsibility to the Dáil for different matters. Sometimes I wonder if <Col N="292" /> Ministers are doing themselves out of a job &ndash; soon they will be responsible for nothing, the way they are going.</P>
      <P>We live in a democracy and we are elected as the democratic representatives of the citizens. From time to time we are asked by people to raise issues in the House on their behalf. Quite often when we do so we are told the Minister has no responsibility to the Dáil in the matter. We should examine this issue. Even if the Minister has no responsibility, we should put in place some mechanism whereby Deputies can get replies from Ministers. We are now at the stage where a citizen can table a request under the Freedom of Information Act and get more details under that mechanism from Departments than Deputies can in the House. In the context of the importance of democracy, in which I strongly believe, and the importance of politics, we should examine this issue and put in place a system whereby if a Deputy tables a question to a Minister the information, if available under the Freedom of Information Act, is made available in the House. The Minister may not be responsible, but the information could be given, because very often information is power. We must address this issue, and I compliment Deputies Higgins and Haughey on the proposals they put forward. For example, the ESB, the NRA and Bord Bia are not responsible in many ways to the House and we cannot get information about what they are doing even though they are responsible to the Government in other ways.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers quite an amount of issues, even though on first inspection it looks quite innocuous. For example, the regulator will licence and bond tour operators and travel agents. This has not been examined and I hope that when the committee looks at this it might get an opportunity to examine what is meant and can tease out the requirements to get a licence. Perhaps tour operators and travel agents will make submissions to the committee, if they have not already done so, as there are many question marks in this context. For example, a number of years ago a colleague was in Spain on holidays and was told that if he wanted his child to sit with him on his return he would have to pay for that privilege, that the seats would have to be pre-booked. He was only told this when he had travelled to Spain. A regulator may need to examine such issues.</P>
      <P>Air transport is vital to our economy from a business, tourism and social perspective. In recent days trains could not travel and roads were blocked. I flew from Cork this morning because I could not depend on the train or the roads. Certainly it is important to have a well regulated air transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition has a part to play also. I understand this Bill will enable the Commission for Aviation Regulation to take charge of the three main airports. What about the smaller airports? <Col N="293" /> Perhaps they should be included in some way or other.</P>
    <P>I represent a Cork constituency and I am obviously concerned about the future of Cork Airport. I have here a proposal by Aer Rianta on the future of Cork Airport headed &ldquo;Major development plans for Cork Airport&rdquo;. The short-term plans include an airport extension, parallel taxi way link, taxi way and so on. I understand the runway overlay has been done but there is no sign of the other work starting. There is also an issue where Cork is concerned. Under certain agreements with the European Union I understand that transatlantic aircraft from America cannot use Cork Airport directly. They have to land in Dublin or in other airports. There is a large number of American companies based in the Cork region and more are to come. It strikes me as bizarre that a chief executive officer or directors of American companies cannot fly directly into Cork to visit their companies. They have to fly to the other airports first. I ask the Minister to look at this when the negotiations are under way. To allow these aircraft to land in Cork I understand a runway extension is required. Admittedly Aer Rianta's long-term plan 2004-20 mentions that a runway extension might be provided. However, that is a long way off. I ask the Minister to look at this with a view to seeing what can be done in the short-term to extend the runway in Cork. I have received some documentation to the effect that the Minister has said there is no real demand for an extension to the runway in Cork. That is not true. There are airlines that would use it if allowed. I ask the Government to look at this matter immediately.</P>
    <P>I met a lady the other day who had come off the aeroplane in Cork in the torrential rain. Because the passenger facilities are not state of the art she got saturated. Those boarding aircraft in a downpour can also get saturated. Air bridges are needed so that passengers can get from the terminal to the aircraft and will not have to sit in aeroplanes soaking wet for one, two or three hours and arrive at their destination wet and cold. That is not good enough in this day and age. I ask the Government to ensure air bridges are provided as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport is extremely successful. Yet I understand its marketing budget is not what it should be and is less than for other airports in the State. Why is this the case? I understand the budget is approximately £400,000 to £500,000 while other airports are allowed spend from £1.8 million to £2 million. There is something wrong here. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply on that issue.</P>
    <P>In Cork we need an extension of the runway and the terminal. In the summer the airport is jammed with people. The numbers using the airport have doubled in the past five years and are expected to increase even further in the next few years.</P>
    <P>I have also received information on which I would like a response from the Minister. I believe <Col N="294" /> Aer Lingus wants to pull out of domestic business in Ireland. The Cork-Dublin route is operated only by Aer Lingus. Aer Arann is there also but is working for Aer Lingus. A return flight costs £92. Given that Aer Lingus is trying to pull out of that route what measures will the Government put in place to attract other carriers to that internal domestic route from the south to the capital city? It is bizarre that other airlines have not come in there and operated a shuttle service. The actual aircrafts are full most of the time. When one tries to get a seat they are booked out. There is a demand even though the prices are high. Something needs to be done. I call on Aer Lingus, other airlines and the Government to look at this issue. For the commercial development of the country a fast, efficient and relatively inexpensive shuttle service between the two major cities and the two major parts of the country is essential.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Government has put on hold its plans to privatise or sell off the airports. We have to be very careful about this proposal. Airlines are like ports and railways. They are an essential part of the infrastructure. If we tamper with them we do so at our peril. I ask the Government to ensure the plans to extend the runway in Cork are put in place soon and to look at the marketing budget for Cork and ascertain why it is not as high as that for other airports. Will the Government ensure that airlines from across the Atlantic can land at Cork Airport direct so that directors of major international companies and passengers do not have to be inconvenienced by flying into one of the other airports first and then being required to either drive, get a bus or wait for a shuttle service to Cork? In this day and age it is bizarre that that is the case.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Aviation Regulation Bill. I have major reservations about the issue of accountability. One part of the Bill deals with air rage. The final part increases the penalties for air rage from £500 to £1,500 and from £700 to £1,500 but the increases are not sufficient. There has been a major increase in air rage incidents across the world in recent years. This is a matter about which pilots are concerned. I do not know if the Minister would be happy to sit in an aeroplane if somebody had an air rage fit or was drunk and disorderly or using a mobile phone without permission. This is happening more and more on aircraft. Airline staff are under enough pressure without having to cope with these incidents. The penalties set out in the Bill may not be sufficient. If there was a sign suggesting one would be fined £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000 for misbehaving on an aircraft, that might be a deterrent. An aircraft is not an ordinary place. Aircraft travel at high speed a few miles above land and nobody can misbehave. There have been incidents where people have tried to get into the cockpits of aircraft and that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Strict measures must be put in place to deter people from misbehaving on aircraft, especially during holidays. People might have a good deal <Col N="295" /> to drink before they board an aircraft and they misbehave on it. If they are very much under the influence, they should not be permitted on the aircraft and perhaps we can examine that, especially if they are boisterous and potentially could misbehave. There is too much at risk if they distract the cabin crew or the pilot while the aircraft is travelling at great height and speed and has a few hundred passengers on board. More and more of these incidents have occurred. That provision needs to be examined and substantially strengthened.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it well as it passes through the House but I ask the Minister of State to take on board the issues I raised.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I also welcome the Bill which covers a number of matters relating to the aviation industry, including the appointment of a regulator, accountability, air rage and a number of other issues. It has been debated in the House over a long number of weeks which demonstrates the interest of Members on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Air transport is important to the economy. The south-east has been left behind in terms of a proper air service between the south-east and the rest of Ireland and, indeed, many European countries. Waterford regional airport is the only airport in the south-east and it could not be described as productive. There is only one flight per day between the airport and the UK and that service is provided by British Airways Express. However, the airline will pull out of the airport in February 2001 which means the airport board must try to negotiate with replacement airlines to provide a service to Waterford and the south-east. One flight per day which arrives and departs at unsuitable times is totally inadequate as it provides no advantage to business people in the region.</P>
      <P>Different Governments over the years, for reasons best known to themselves, have neglected Waterford airport. The south-east has an airport with some facilities but there are no flights. The most interesting aspect of the airport is that Ryanair originated there and it was one of the first airlines to use the airport. However, Ryanair left Waterford and moved further afield and has made substantial profits. The board of Waterford airport should possibly negotiate the return of Michael O'Leary and Ryanair. The board is doing its best to negotiate a replacement airline for British Airways Express but it is doing so with its hands tied behind its back because the runway is completely unsuitable for the landing and take off of modern jets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite repeated requests different Ministers have ignored the need to upgrade the airport's runway and invest the £7 million required to develop more facilities for passengers and to encourage and negotiate with new airlines to provide a service to the region. It is unacceptable that there is no flight between Waterford regional airport and Dublin. Deputy Stanton mentioned <Col N="296" /> that he flew to Dublin earlier from Cork Airport. It is not possible to fly from the south-east to any part of Ireland, yet there seems to be a sincere effort to invest and develop Sligo, Knock, Kerry, Galway and Donegal airports.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the south-east gets few industries is that of the lack of airport facilities and as you are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, rail facilities are also not good. Waterford regional airport has been neglected for too long. I call on the Minister of State to make a commitment to invest heavily in the airport to provide an extended runway and extra facilities. The south-east is becoming similar to an island. We do not have great facilities to travel out of the region other than by car and the roads have become clogged up. It is important that the people of the south-east share in the success of the Celtic tiger economy, which is running ahead of itself. However, the region has not gained any advantage in terms of transport over the past five or six years during which the economy has been booming.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider extending, developing and providing a proper airport in Waterford for the six counties of the south-east, including my own county, Wexford, and Counties Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary and Wicklow. There is a great deal of traffic chaos in Dublin and the time it takes to travel from the south-east to Dublin, whether one passes through Carlow and Naas or Arklow, is increasing all the time because of the major jump in the number of cars on our roads. It is time the south-east had a facility which would benefit the people of the region.</P>
    <P>I have passed through Dublin Airport on a number of occasions recently. It is chaotic and is in a complete mess. Industrial relations in Aer Lingus seem to be at an all time low. The baggage collection area is overcrowded and it is absolutely frightening at times. Aer Rianta does not seem to have a clue how to address the problem. It is important that the Minister seriously examines making improvements at Dublin Airport. We all accept that it is being developed but customers should not have to put up with the archaic facilities there.</P>
    <P>My major concern is the development of Waterford regional airport. Given the budget surplus available to the Government there is an opportunity to once and for all show an interest in Waterford and the south-east and to spend the £7 million required to extend the runway. It is a small investment in terms of the money in the Government's coffers to provide an adequate, decent and efficient service for the people of the south-east.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a significant milestone for the hugely important aviation industry. When the Bill is enacted the commission will regulate five key areas of airport business &ndash; airport and traffic control; charges; ground handling service providers; the granting <Col N="297" /> of operating licences to air carriers set up in Ireland; the administration of rules governing the allocation of take off and landing slots at airports; and the licensing and funding of travel agents and tour operators. The legislation addresses the management of airports with a throughput in excess of one million passengers per annum.</P>
      <P>Up to 14 million passengers will pass through Dublin Airport this year. A couple of weeks ago I returned from Toronto through Dublin Airport on a Tuesday morning at about 11 o'clock and the baggage reclaim area was a total nightmare, given the number of people there. I know there are proposals to increase the number of carousels to ten and to open new check-in desks. Like many thousands of others using the airport, however, I wonder why there are such long queues to check in for flights. The Minister asked some of my colleagues whether the queues were at Aer Lingus desks, but as far as I am concerned it does not matter where the queues are. They are in Dublin Airport where all the people are congregating to go out on flights. On top of that, all those who are returning end up in the same area, trying to get out of the airport. When they do so, they have to cross the road to the car park, and those who require taxis may get one if they are lucky. The majority, however, remain a long time queuing for taxis.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration that we are trying to provide a friendly service for over six million tourists coming here every year, it should be recognised that a substantial percentage of them come through Dublin Airport. I am chairman of the Meath Tourism Promotional Company, which is only down the road from the airport, and I spend a substantial amount of money like all the other tourism agencies. I cannot see why the Government, which has been three and a half years in office, has not put together a proposal to deal with the overcrowding at Dublin Airport. Is the Government afraid to make a decision on a second terminal, be it at Dublin Airport or Baldonnel?</P>
      <P>I am sure many people in the Baldonnel area would complain about the threat of noise from aircraft if such a development took place, but the bottom line is that tour operators will say: &ldquo;There is no point in flying to Dublin, you will be in queues coming in and you will have far worse queues leaving the country.&rdquo; That is not the friendly attitude we should be projecting to people using Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have yet to hear the Minister's response to the proposed criticisms. She may appear on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;, &ldquo;The News at One&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Five-Seven Live&rdquo;, to present her point of view, but she is not making decisions about the aviation industry. Like the DART and Luas, we have allowed an unacceptable situation to develop. When one visits other countries to see what they are doing about tourism, people there say there is no point in visiting Dublin because it is clogged up all the time and one cannot get a taxi. Even if one gets <Col N="298" /> a taxi, one will be sitting in traffic the whole day. The Minister is responsible for this but she has been ineffective in dealing with the long-term problems I have mentioned, not alone at the airport but also in introducing the Luas in parts of Dublin. The Luas was proposed and shelved, and then proposed again and shelved yet again while the Minister awaited different reports.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that Aer Lingus will soon be operating in the region of 550 flights per day, which is an enormous number. Taking into consideration the other carriers operating into and out of the country's main airports, we have seen a huge growth in the aviation business. Aer Rianta has made substantial amounts of money during this time, but it has refused to put pressure on the powers that be, although perhaps it did with some Ministers in the previous Government, to make a decision about providing a second terminal. The millions of people using Dublin Airport every day on business trips find that the problems of congestion at the airport are no different from the traffic gridlock in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Government has a duty to ensure that its citizens are provided with the best transport services that can be made available. It is not as if a Minister can claim that funds are not available in the national development plan, which was six months to a year late. The details necessary to alleviate some of the transport problems are scarce, including the finalisation of reports and contracts.</P>
    <P>If a Luas line was provided from the airport to Dublin and adequate trains were provided to rural areas, such as the Navan line, many people would not have to use their cars. Aer Rianta has provided a long-term car park which is so far from the airport terminal it is nearly half way to Ashbourne. If there was a faster way of getting to Dublin Airport people would not have to leave their cars in the long-term car park. At Dublin Airport everything is being put further away from where people want to go.</P>
    <P>When somebody has the will to make a decision to build a second terminal, it should be done on the basis of a private public partnership. Many problems across the country are being solved by such initiatives. On this occasion, however, the Minister is unwilling to bring proposals to Cabinet to solve the problem. Whenever the decision is made it will take at least three years, given planning permission and other matters, before there is any progress towards a second terminal, whether at Dublin Airport or another location.</P>
    <P>There is no willingness on the part of the other members of the Cabinet from Dublin to use their influence on the Minister with responsibility for transport to have this problem solved. We must make a decision at what level beyond which we do not want the numbers of tourists to rise over the next number of years because we have not provided the services and transport to deal with them while they are in the country.</P>
    <P>I should have indicated at the outset that I wish <Col N="299" /> to share my time with Deputy Currie. The Minister has let down a substantial number of people by not making decisions in this area. The Bill will do some good but there is an alarming number of gaps in what she has done. Perhaps the Minister, in replying, will account for her inaction in dealing with the problems in Dublin Airport and in other parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware from a deputation from Baldonnell Airport liaison committee she met recently and from comments made by me on Question Time on the previous occasion when she answered questions, which was Thursday, 19 October, there is widespread concern among people in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome and along the flight path of the possibility of civil aviation activities at Baldonnell.</P>
      <P>This concern is based on safety and environmental grounds. The flight path to and from Baldonnell is over a built-up area with proposals for the construction of thousands of houses over the next few years. It is not strange that people would worry about their safety in such circumstances, especially in the aftermath of the Concorde crash in Paris. Television pictures graphically showed how close thousands of people along the flight path were to the catastrophe. It has been calculated that aircraft will be flying over Tallaght Hospital at an altitude of 500 feet. What effect will that have on patients and staff? What effect will low flying and, in some cases, old and noisy aircraft have on schools? Residents tell me that, while they are reasonably satisfied that safety in the air will be catered for, safety on the ground will not.</P>
      <P>The Minister and so-called experts may say that these fears are exaggerated. That may or may not be the case. The Minister and I know that fear of the unknown is the greatest fear and there is no doubt that local residents in the vicinity of Baldonnell and along the flight path have been and are kept in the dark about the true facts surrounding non-military use of the aerodrome. The first and priority need is to inform people of the Government's intentions for Baldonnell and to provide the maximum factual information on the position.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement in reply to parliamentary questions on 19 October that the Government has no intention to open a State airport at Baldonnell. However, she went on to say: &ldquo;If a private investor wishes to do so, that is a matter for him or her&rdquo;. Surely that is not the position. It is a matter for the Minister for Defence and the Government as to who uses this Department of Defence airport. In the earlier part of her reply, the Minister said as much. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, told the House on 15 May last that he would like to make a final decision on the use of Baldonnell and publish the report before autumn. It is now clearly autumn, if not winter. When does the Minister understand the report will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> Fears have been expressed inside and outside the House that section 46 represents the thin end of the wedge for Baldonnell. We have been told by the Minister and the Minister for Defence that section 46 is designed to cover Gormanston for the purpose of a flight training school. The Minister said that in the House on 4 October. She said on 19 October, the previous occasion she answered parliamentary questions, in response to me that she would reflect on section 46 and she seemed to promise that, in her reply to the Second Stage debate or on Committee Stage, she would make it clear that section 46 referred only to Gormanston. The only doubt in her mind was:</P>
    <P>The question remains whether this should be done by way of deletion of section 46 or confirmation that it refers only to the potential introduction of a pilot training ground at Gormanston.</P>
    <P>At Question Time on 19 October, I asked the Minister:</P>
    <P>Will the Minister make clear in her thinking on section 46 that that refers to Gormanston and not Baldonnell? The Minister is nodding her head in agreement but will she put it on the record of the House that that means &ldquo;yes&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I look forward to the Minister responding on this matter and giving the confirmation I expect.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that, on 1 November, a deputation from the Baldonnell Airport liaison committee met the Tánaiste and the Minister for Defence, that they were given certain assurances and that they came away thinking it was a satisfactory meeting in terms of section 46 because they believed the Minister for Defence told them that he felt that section 46 would not be proceeded with now. They did not get a satisfactory reply to their probing on the future possibilities of civilian operations at Baldonnell because he persisted in saying that he was referring to the immediate future. The delegation did not find that reply reassuring. Perhaps the Minister for Public Enterprise will reassure us on it.</P>
    <P>The delegation from Baldonnell Airport liaison committee raised with the Minister the question of planning permission. My Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, raised the issue at Question Time on 19 October. The Minister for Public Enterprise replied that she would also reflect on this issue:</P>
    <P>...in case there was an implicit, rather than stated, easement in it, whereby, while there would always be a need for planning permission, larger scale aviation could be developed without many of the rigorous matters to which Deputy Mitchell referred, such as environmental impact studies. I am reflecting on that, so that any applicant will have to undergo the full rigours, as is proper, in terms of planning permission and the other attendant matters now required for any application. I am certainly reflecting on section 46 to see whether <Col N="301" /> an amendment tabled by me or another Member or a deletion would be the appropriate way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I welcome that statement and the assurance by the Minister. I look forward to its early implementation. I repeat and underline that any proposals for change in the use of Baldonnell must be fully discussed with the local community and must have the fullest possible consultation process. Genuine fears must be addressed and must be seen by the local community to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contribute to the debate on this important Bill in regard to a number of matters. Representations have been made on the Bill by many concerned citizens within County Kildare. It is seen in the northern part of the county that further development of Baldonnell as a civilian airport will cause major problems for many of the developments which are now being put in place in Kildare. As a result of the high demand for housing in the capital city, developers have made major moves into Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Louth to provide further houses for people working in the capital. There have, as a result, been major residential developments in many areas in north Kildare, such as Ardclough, Straffan and Celbridge. People in these areas have formed action groups in regard to the development of Baldonnel Aerodrome as a civilian airport.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers said, there has been a change in the stance taken by the relevant Ministers in relation to section 46. The previous Minister said on 24 January 1996:</P>
      <P>Two airports for Dublin would duplicate infrastructure and facilities. The entry costs of adopting Baldonnel would be high. Airlines could well be reluctant to transfer to a secondary location because of the inability to offer an integrated service and the absence of the hubbing opportunities that are available through Dublin Airport. The coming on stream of the Baldonnel project would coincide with the planning abolition of intra-EU duty free sales from 1999 and will have adverse implications for all airports.</P>
      <P>One wonders why the position has changed so much from what the then Minister said at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we develop Baldonnel as a civilian airport, there will be problems for that general area. Why was the planning authority for that area not <i>au fait </i>with this proposal when it let so many business parks be developed in that area? The south-west development there is creating thousands of jobs. There are further applications for sites all along the carriageway, from Naas to Clondalkin, for the development of business parks, industrial parks, hotels, golf courses and so on. However, according to this Bill, the density of vehicles in that area will be increased by the inclusion of a civilian airport. That will create major traffic problems. We saw over the past few years the <Col N="302" /> major delays that were caused by providing one extra line of traffic from Clondalkin cross to Rathcoole. That caused major hold-ups for about a year and a half. All the relevant infrastructure would have to be put in place to develop a civilian airport, which would have implications for other developments.</P>
    <P>As a member of a sporting body, I deeply regret the problems being caused for the FAI in relation to Eircom Park. That association was on its knees for many years and had no real input into its own activities in terms of its own stadium. A superb chief executive has now put together a package which means the association is self-sufficient in terms of the provision of its own playing areas. A proper national facility should be provided for this association which has done so well over recent years. Who would have thought in the 1950s, when people packed into Dalymount Park for only the odd match, that we would see this association represent us so proudly at international level, at World Cup and European Cup matches? However, now that it has the chance to build a stadium, it seems every hindrance possible is being put in place to prevent that happening.</P>
    <P>It should have been made clear to the FAI in the initial stages of this development that there were problems in relation to the provision of Eircom Park. We must remember that this issue was raised by the Department of Defence in relation to a number of flights and not in relation to a civilian airport. That is a major problem. If we develop Baldonnel as a civilian airport, we will endanger many lives by having flights across the densely populated areas of north Kildare, Dublin and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy, I have received numerous representations in relation to the small private airfields that are beginning to adorn the countryside as a result of the Celtic tiger. Airfields are suddenly opening near local villages. One wonders what the regulations are in relation to these. Do they need permission from the local authority for the number of flights? Many of these airfields have opened for business purposes. It is all right if the owner of an airfield has his own aeroplane. However, many of these are business ventures which provide flights for parachutists, people wanting scenic views and so on. The constant use of airfields for such purposes is creating problems for people in those areas. One wonders whether they got planning permission. Are there records of the number of flights in any particular airport or airfield that ordinary people can check? What size aircraft are allowed use these airfields?</P>
    <P>On my way to a match in Newbridge recently I was diverted onto a side road because an aeroplane had overrun the runway in an airfield and gone onto the main road. All the traffic had to be diverted. One wonders how planning permission was granted for an airfield so close to a national road, the N78. An increase in the number of airfields is becoming the norm as a result of the Celtic tiger. However, there is nothing in this Bill <Col N="303" /> that will control the demand for airfields or give guidelines to local authorities in terms of control of usage and the records of these airfields.</P>

      <P>Ann Ryan died on 15 March 1996. She was the wife of John Ryan and they had two young children. On 6 November 1996, by order of the District Court, Philip Sheedy, an architect working for South Dublin County Council, was returned for trial to the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court charged with offences under the Road <Col N="304" /> Traffic Acts relating to the death of Anne Ryan. Criminal proceedings brought against Mr. Sheedy were subsequently adjourned on various occasions to the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court before being listed for arraignment before the then Judge Cyril Kelly on 11 June 1997. On that date Philip Sheedy pleaded guilty to the charge of dangerous driving causing death and to driving a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while having drunk alcohol in excess of the legal limit.</P>
      <P>Following Philip Sheedy's plea of guilty, Judge Cyril Kelly adjourned the case for sentence until 20 October 1997 and ordered that medical reports and a probation and welfare report be obtained. Philip Sheedy was remanded on continuing bail. On 20 October 1997, Philip Sheedy came before Judge Joseph Matthews for sentencing. The court ordered that he be imprisoned for a period of four years on the charge of dangerous driving causing death and on that charge he was disqualified from holding a driving licence for 12 years. On the charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol, he was disqualified from holding a driving licence for a period of one year.</P>
      <P>The court ordered that the four year prison sentence imposed on 20 October 1997 could be reviewed on 20 October 1999. If this order had not been changed, it automatically meant that Philip Sheedy, having served two years' imprisonment, had available to him the possibility of being released when his sentence came to be reviewed on 20 October 1999. This stated review date also, however, ensured that Philip Sheedy would, as a minimum, serve two years of his four year sentence and could not in the intervening period avail of the possibility of an early release from prison should such opportunity arise.</P>
      <P>On 6 November 1997, Philip Sheedy's lawyers applied to Judge Matthews to vacate that part of the order made on 20 October 1997 which had designated 20 October 1999 as a review date. In response to this application, the review date was vacated or, to use non legal jargon, it was removed from the court order so there was no longer a date specifically designated by the court for the review of Sheedy's sentence. No appeal of any nature was filed on Philip Sheedy's behalf against the four year sentence imposed by the court.</P>
      <P>Just over a year after the imposition of the sentence on Philip Sheedy, on 12 November 1998, his case was relisted in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court before Judge Cyril Kelly. While it was Judge Kelly to whom the pleas of guilty had been made, Judge Matthews had imposed sentence. Judge Kelly, on 12 November 1998, ordered that the balance of the sentence imposed on 20 October 1997 on Philip Sheedy be suspended on Mr Sheedy's undertaking on his own bond of £100 that he would keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative to list the Sheedy case before Judge Cyril Kelly did not derive from the actions of the solicitor then acting for Philip Sheedy but <Col N="305" /> was the result of a conversation between the then Supreme Court Judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, and the then Dublin County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan. Following former Supreme Court Judge O'Flaherty mentioning the Sheedy case to Michael Quinlan, Mr. Quinlan contacted the solicitors acting for Mr. Philip Sheedy and informed them that Judge Kelly was awaiting the making of an application relating to Sheedy's sentence to be listed for his court. While Mr. Michael Quinlan and Mr. Philip Sheedy's solicitor, Mr. Michael Staines, have given different versions of the exact exchanges that took place between them, it is clear that Mr. Quinlan initiated the arrangements for the Sheedy case to be listed before Judge Cyril Kelly on 12 November 1998 and that the case would never have been so listed had former Supreme Court Judge O'Flaherty not discussed Sheedy's case with Mr. Michael Quinlan.</P>
    <P>The family of the late Ann Ryan accidentally learnt of the early release of Philip Sheedy. They were understandably outraged and the general public was rightly scandalised when the circumstances relating to the early release of Philip Sheedy became known. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions denied it had been furnished with any advance notice of the possible reopening of the Sheedy case and brought proceedings in the High Court to quash the order made by Judge Kelly, which had suspended the sentence of Philip Sheedy and resulted in his release. On 25 March 1999, Philip Sheedy, through his lawyers, withdrew his opposition in the High Court to the quashing of the order made by which he was released. As a consequence, the High Court set aside Judge Kelly's order of 12 November 1998 and Mr Philip Sheedy returned to prison.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Philip Sheedy case had been dealt with in our courts resulted in substantial public controversy. On 1 April 1999, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the Dáil that his Department was conducting an inquiry into what occurred and that officials of his Department had been in contact with the Dublin County Registrar responsible for the Dublin Circuit Court and also with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. The House was also informed that separate inquiries had been instituted by the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>The circumstances surrounding the relisting of the Philip Sheedy case and Mr. Sheedy's early release in November 1998 were unprecedented. Chief Justice Liam Hamilton, in his report of 14 April 1999 into the affair, detailed the following questions as requiring an answer. First, how and why was the sentence imposed on Philip Sheedy by the court on 20 October 1997 listed for review on 12 November 1998 when the case had been finally dealt with by the order of the Circuit Criminal Court on 6 November 1997 vacating the provision for review of sentence? Second, how did it come to be listed before Judge Cyril Kelly and not Judge Matthews who had made the original order imposing sentence on 20 October <Col N="306" /> 1997? Third, was any notice given to the Chief State Solicitor's Office with regard to either the re-entry or listing of the application or the nature of the application being made on Philip Sheedy's behalf? Fourth, was there any appearance in the court on 12 November 1998 on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions? Fifth, was the manner in which the case was dealt with by Judge Kelly and, sixth, was there any involvement by members or a member of the Judiciary in requesting or making arrangements for the listing or re-entry of the case on 12 November 1998?</P>
    <P>Prior to publication by the Chief Justice of his report, interviews were undertaken by him with the central persons involved in the affair and written statements obtained from them detailing the nature of their involvement. On the basis of facts either admitted or established Chief Justice Hamilton concluded &ldquo;that Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's intervention was inappropriate and unwise, that it left his motives and action open to misinterpretation and it was therefore damaging to the administration of justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice's conclusions in relation to Judge Cyril Kelly were even more damning. In the brief hearing of just over a minute that had taken place before him on 12 November 1998, Judge Kelly had explained or justified his early release of Philip Sheedy by referring to a psychiatrist's report on the court file. The implication was that some assessment had been undertaken of Mr. Sheedy's mental condition since his sentence to imprisonment which justified his release. The reality, as documented by the Chief Justice, was that no up to date medical or psychological report existed. Even more astonishingly, in response to a statement made by Mr. Sheedy's solicitor to the Chief Justice concerning events that occurred subsequent to Mr. Sheedy's release, Judge Kelly acknowledged that he had met Mr. Sheedy's counsel informally and suggested to him &ldquo;that he should consider obtaining an up to date medical report&rdquo;, the implication being that such report should thereafter be placed on the Sheedy court file even though Mr. Sheedy had already been released.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sheedy's solicitor, Mr. Michael Staines, properly refused to act on the judge's suggestion. The Chief Justice in page 22 of his report states: &ldquo;whatever the motive for that suggestion may have been, having regard to the fact that the case had concluded in the Circuit Court, it was manifestly improper&rdquo;. To this day, it is not known why Judge Kelly during the brief court hearing of 12 November 1998 made reference to a non-existent psychological report or why, subsequent to the release of Mr. Philip Sheedy, he improperly proposed to Mr. Sheedy's counsel that an updated report be obtained.</P>
    <P>In releasing Philip Sheedy at the hearing of 12 November 1998, Judge Kelly heard no submissions either on behalf of the convicted Philip Sheedy or on the State's behalf. Chief Justice Hamilton concluded that &ldquo;by announcing his decision without allowing either party to make <Col N="307" /> prior submissions concerning the case, the learned trial Judge [that is, Judge Cyril Kelly] deprived himself of any opportunity to learn from proper sources what the proper condition of the accused was&rdquo;. To this day, it is unknown why Judge Cyril Kelly made a decision to release Philip Sheedy without any submission first being made to the court on Philip Sheedy's behalf that he be released or without ensuring that counsel representing the State had an opportunity to address in court whether the State agreed with or opposed Philip Sheedy's early release.</P>
    <P>In the context of Judge Matthews still being a sitting member of the Circuit Court, any application made to that court on Philip Sheedy's behalf for early release should have been made to Judge Matthews as the sentencing judge. As the designated sentence review date had in November 1997 been deleted from the original court order made in October 1997, as far as the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court was concerned, the Sheedy case was over. Just as there was no basis for any application being properly made to Judge Matthews to release Philip Sheedy in 1998, there was no basis at all for such application coming before Judge Cyril Kelly.</P>
    <P>In response to the Chief Justice's inquiries, the then Judge Kelly expressed the view that it was not an unusual practice for a Circuit Court judge to make orders where another Circuit Court judge had previously made an order in a criminal case previously determined. The President of the Circuit Court and Judge Joseph Matthews disagreed entirely with this view. The Chief Justice in his report concluded that Judge Kelly should not in the circumstances of the Sheedy case have entered on a review of a sentence imposed by one of his colleagues. The question remains unanswered as to why Judge Cyril Kelly undertook such review and why he represented to the Chief Justice that there was nothing extraordinary in his doing so. The Chief Justice concluded that Judge Cyril Kelly having entered on the review of Philip Sheedy's sentence &ldquo;failed to conduct the case in a manner befitting a judge&rdquo; and that his &ldquo;handling of this matter compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Six days after publication of the Chief Justice's report, Judge Hugh O'Flaherty and Judge Cyril Kelly resigned. Following publication of the report into the Sheedy affair by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Dublin County Registrar, Mr. Michael Quinlan, also resigned. Why then should Dáil Éireann further concern itself with this affair? The reason is that the circumstances surrounding the early release of Philip Sheedy seriously undermined the integrity of our criminal justice system. Credence was given to the view that should one break the law and be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, if one has the right contacts and connections, one would not have to complete one's sentence and one would be facilitated by members of the Judiciary in obtaining an early release from pri<Col N="308" /> son. A body blow was delivered to the concept of judicial impartiality and the constitutional principle of equality before the law.</P>
    <P>In a constitutional democracy based on the separation of powers, for the Judiciary to maintain public credibility, judges must be seen to be impartial and independent in carrying out their duties. It is crucial that where there are allegations of judicial misconduct, those allegations are properly investigated in so far as is possible for the full facts to become known. With regard to the early release of Philip Sheedy, there remain far too many questions unanswered. The Chief Justice was constrained in the approach he could take in the inquiry that was so speedily and effectively undertaken by him and when it came to determining who was telling the truth in the context of what was said in individual interviews and contained in written statements, he acknowledged: </P>
    <P>as is apparent from a consideration of the documents annexed to this Report, a number of disputed questions of fact arise in this case. It is not possible for me on the basis of written statements and individual interviews to resolve these disputed questions of fact, nor is it appropriate that I should attempt to do so. The resolution of disputed questions of fact would necessitate an inquiry of a nature different from that instituted by me wherein the parties involved in such disputed facts would in the interests of fair procedures be entitled to the right of cross examination.</P>
    <P>Moreover, paragraph 1.5 of the report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform into the Sheedy affair sought by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform states: &ldquo;We have been able to reach certain conclusions, in relation to the central issues we examined and we believe that one of these is so serious that an immediate report must be made, even if it is the case that the report, taken as a whole, leaves questions unanswered that will, no doubt, be raised in the period ahead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have referred to some of the unanswered questions. Questions not yet detailed of substantial importance derive from the statement made by Judge Joseph Matthews to the Chief Justice when it is contrasted with statements made by former Judge Cyril Kelly. In his statement of 5 April, Judge Matthews details a telephone call received by him in his chambers from Judge Kelly on the morning of 20 October 1997 asking him if he would be free to take a plea of guilty case, which turned out to be the Sheedy case, in the lunch recess. He details that Judge Kelly said that counsel on both sides of the case had been to his chambers on various occasions to discuss various aspects of the case and also issues concerning a compensation payment that might be made to a victim. Judge Matthews states that in his telephone call, Judge Kelly expressed the view that &ldquo;he felt too close to the case and would rather I dealt with it&rdquo;, that is, that Judge Matthews dealt <Col N="309" /> with it. Judge Matthews reports Judge Kelly as saying to him that he &ldquo;felt it was a suitable case for a suspended sentence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Judge Matthews records that the Sheedy file was furnished to him and having read that file he formed the view that it could not on any basis be a case for a suspended sentence. He states that he subsequently that day visited Judge Kelly in his chambers and so informed him. Judge Kelly in a response of 13 April documented in the Chief Justice's report mentions that he made contact by telephone with Judge Matthews and asked him to &ldquo;take a guilty plea in a dangerous driving causing death case&rdquo;, but denies that he had the conversation recounted by Judge Matthews and denies that he had seen counsel on both sides of the case in his chambers on various occasions to discuss aspects of the case and the issues of financial compensation. He also denies that he had said he was too close to the case and preferred that Judge Matthews dealt with it. He further denies that he told Judge Matthews that he believed the case was suitable for a suspended sentence and he does not accept that Judge Matthews came to see him in his chambers.</P>
    <P>If it is accepted that Judge Joseph Matthews accurately recollects the events that occurred, a question must be asked as to why Judge Cyril Kelly did not accept Judge Matthews' account of these events. If Judge Cyril Kelly requested Judge Matthews to deal with sentencing in the Sheedy case in 1997 because he, Judge Kelly, was too close to the case, why did Judge Kelly regard it as appropriate to grant the early release of Philip Sheedy 12 months later? If Judge Kelly was familiar with the Sheedy file, as he acknowledges, and if he did not regard himself as too close to the case, why did he transfer the file to Judge Matthews for sentencing in the first place? If Judge Cyril Kelly's account of events is accurate and Judge Matthews' account is not, why would Judge Matthews so misrepresent what occurred?</P>
    <P>Shortly after the release of Philip Sheedy, Cyril Kelly was appointed as a Judge of the High Court. It was as a member of the High Court Judiciary that he resigned. Judge Joseph Matthews remains a respected member of the Circuit Court Judiciary and it is in the public interest that a mechanism be put in place to unravel and get to the truth of what occurred in the context of the conflicting accounts given by Judge Matthews and former Judge Kelly. The existence of conflicting and irreconcilable statements relating to events relevant to the original sentencing of Philip Sheedy and the many unanswered questions concerning his early release continue to cast a shadow over the administration of justice in this State.</P>
    <P>Article 35.2 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.&rdquo;  Our Constitution prescribes a system of separation of powers. It is essential that judicial decisions made and judgments delivered are not open to question by <Col N="310" /> way of independent inquiries conducted by or ordered by the Houses of the Oireachtas or the Government of the day. Decisions made and judgments delivered can be subject to an appellate process and should be open only to review and reversal by the relevant court to which an appeal can be made. However, our law has for long distinguished between judicial decisions made and judgments delivered on the one hand and issues relating to the conduct of members of the Judiciary on the other. Section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, provides (a) for a mechanism whereby the Minister for Justice may request the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to investigate the condition of health, either physical or mental, of a judge of the District Court or (b) to inquire into the conduct, whether in the execution of his office or otherwise, of a District Court judge, either generally or on a particular occasion.</P>
    <P>The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, also contains provisions in sections 10 and 36 addressing issues of conduct relating to District Court judges. Section 21 of the 1946 Act has been utilised to facilitate the recent inquiry into allegations made against District Court Judge O'Buachalla. The attempt made by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to investigate the Sheedy affair ran into the sand as a consequence of legal advice given to the committee that it would be unconstitutional for the committee to hold hearings and to ask that former Supreme Court Judge O'Flaherty and former High Court Judge Cyril Kelly come before it to answer questions. This advice was based on the provisions contained in Article 35.2 of the Constitution. However, it is clear that no detailed consideration was given by the committee to the possibility of differentiating between judicial decision-making and judgment delivering as compared to judicial conduct.</P>
    <P>It is also clear, even if such a distinction had been made by it, that the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights was not equipped to address comprehensively the unanswered questions concerning the Sheedy affair. Even if the committee had not received legal advice that blocked its advancing the issue, little progress could have been made by it as the compellability legislation &ndash; even if extended to it &ndash; does not apply to members or former members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Replying to questions in Dáil Éireann on 20 April 1999 on the published reports into the Sheedy affair, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated &ldquo;it must be clear to everyone that a tribunal of inquiry is necessary if the disputed facts are to be resolved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To bring closure to this issue and to provide a forum within which the full story can become known, Fine Gael is calling on the Government to bring before this House without delay legislation to establish a special inquiry specifically into the Sheedy affair, and for such an inquiry to be chaired by a judge appointed from outside the <Col N="311" /> State. We propose that the inquiry be chaired by a judge from outside the State as we believe to ask a current member of the Judiciary to undertake such an inquiry would place him or her in an invidious position. We suggest it be a three person inquiry, that it should be conferred with express powers to compel witnesses and call for documents and that it should be authorised to fully inquire into the circumstances leading to the early release of Philip Sheedy and be given express powers to consider the conduct of members of the Judiciary involved and the reason why they so conducted themselves.</P>
    <P>It can be accurately asserted that Article 35.2 places no barrier in the way of legislation providing for such an inquiry or an inquiry investigating the conduct of Judge Cyril Kelly in the context of any dealings between him and Judge Joseph Matthews relating to the Sheedy case; the nature of the hearing that took place before him in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 12 November 1998; whether any other case in the past was similarly dealt with by him in the context of his assertion that the procedure adopted by him was not unusual; and his suggestion to Philip Sheedy's barrister that a new psychiatric report be obtained. The inquiry can essentially seek to ascertain why Judge Cyril Kelly so conducted himself without being at risk of constitutional impropriety.</P>
    <P>In relation to the former Supreme Court Judge Hugh O'Flaherty, it is entirely unacceptable that he has made himself available to answer questions in the national media but that to date no investigative forum has been put in place in which he can be questioned concerning his involvement in this affair. It is curious that prior to his resignation from the Supreme Court Mr. O'Flaherty offered to come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and that subsequent to his resignation he refused to do so, citing constitutional reasons. As his involvement, based on his own statements to the Chief Justice, resulted from a street conversation with associates of Philip Sheedy and a subsequent conversation with the county registrar, it is difficult to understand what constitutional difficulties stand in the way of Mr. O'Flaherty answering questions in an appropriate forum on what occurred. There can be no suggestion that his involvement in the Philip Sheedy affair was undertaken in the exercise of a judicial function.</P>
    <P>The disciplinary procedures available under the Acts of 1946 and 1961 to investigate allegations of misconduct against district judges were already referred to. In the context of tonight's motion it is also worth noting that the constitutional review body chaired by Dr. T. K. Whitaker, which published its report in 1996, dealt at length with the issue of judicial independence. It was stated that the group was:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> of the opinion that such &ldquo;disciplinary&rdquo; provisions short of impeachment, as at present apply to the District Court are probably not inconsistent with Article 52 of the Constitution or otherwise unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>in the context of the view of the Whitaker committee, if it is accepted there is no constitutional difficulty in investigating allegations of misconduct made against district judges, how can it be suggested that an inquiry to investigate allegations of misconduct made against judges of the Circuit, High or Supreme Court could be unconstitutional? How can it be argued that Article 35.2 could present a barrier of any nature to such an inquiry? It is also in this context worth noting that both the Whitaker committee and the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in its report of November 1999 on the courts and the Judiciary propose that to put such considerations beyond doubt, Article 35.2 of the Constitution should be amended to allow for the review of judicial conduct as distinct from judicial decisions. It is worth noting that to date the Government has not seen fit to act on the recommendation made by either the Whitaker committee in 1996 or the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in 1999.</P>
    <P>The death of Ann Ryan was an appalling tragedy for her husband John, their two young children and all their family. The early release of Philip Sheedy in extraordinary circumstances added to the trauma suffered by the Ryan family and rightly caused public outrage. On a different scale and for different reasons, their involvement in Philip Sheedy's court proceedings was a personal tragedy for both Hugh O'Flaherty and Cyril Kelly. What were up to then distinguished careers on the bench were prematurely and unexpectedly ended. Confronted by the conclusions in the Chief Justice's report and the possibility of impeachment, each rightly concluded that they should resign from judicial office. I can understand that the Dáil again reopening this issue may be a cause of further distress and this I greatly regret. However, it is not acceptable that so many questions remain unanswered. It is not acceptable that we still do not know why Judge Cyril Kelly behaved as he did with regard to the Sheedy case and there remains on public record totally conflicting versions of events relating to the original sentencing of Philip Sheedy in the statements of Judge Joseph Matthews and former Judge Kelly. It is time we learnt the full truth.</P>
    <P>It is time to restore public confidence in our justice system. It is time to accept that everyone in public life, including judges, are publicly accountable for the manner in which they conduct themselves in public office. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform acknowledged in this House on 20 April 1999 that the full truth will only be known as a result of an inquiry into the affair. It is time for him for explain why to date he has not brought proposals before this House on the Government's behalf for such an inquiry to bring closure to the Sheedy affair. He should also explain why to date he has failed to <Col N="313" /> put in place the new disciplinary code for judges promised by him in the Dáil on 20 April immediately following the resignation of Judges O'Flaherty and Kelly. The report into the Sheedy affair prepared by his Department entitled &ldquo;Avoiding a Repetition&rdquo;  promised the introduction of reforms which the Minister, never slow to praise himself, described as &ldquo;far reaching, comprehensive and positive&rdquo;. The Minister should explain why one and a half years later, none of these proposals have been implemented. He should explain why reality and his rhetoric have lost touch with each other.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice in various statements both inside and outside the House and when answering questions on the Sheedy affair expressed grave concerns about what had occurred. The credibility of the Minister's publicly expressed concerned was substantially undermined by the Government's proposal last June to appoint former Supreme Court Judge Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank. This proposed appointment appeared to give Government approval to Hugh O'Flaherty's refusal to explain his actions to the Oireachtas joint committee when asked to do so. If the Government believes it is in the public interest that the full truth behind the Sheedy affair be known, it should support the motion I have tabled on behalf of Fine Gael and withdraw the ineffectual and meaningless amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I agree with Deputy Shatter. We are failing in our public responsibilities unless we ensure the most far-reaching constitutional crisis in the history of the State is fully and thoroughly investigated. While the report of the Chief Justice on the Sheedy case is commendable in that it established a sufficient body of facts to warrant the forced resignation of a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and a county registrar, it is also true that many aspects of the entire saga have not been dealt with and the report has only scratched the surface. Many of the details of what happened, how it happened and who was involved in the affair have not been uncovered. None of the evidence offered to the Chief Justice for his report, the Chief State Solicitor's office for its report or to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for its report was taken under oath.</P>
      <P>Many of the persons involved in the Sheedy case, either centrally or peripherally, were never interviewed or questioned. As a result, the most serious judicial controversy in the history of the State, a case which goes to the very heart of judicial credibility and the public's faith in a central instrument of the criminal justice system, the courts, is shrouded in mystery and has not been satisfactorily explained, explored or resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Shatter stated, the initiative in this matter should not be coming from the Opposition but should have been taken long ago by the Government. However, for reasons best known to it, the Government has abdicated its responsi<Col N="314" /> bility, believing the public interest was sufficiently served by the return of Philip Sheedy to prison and by the forced resignation of three of the individuals centrally involved. The public good will not be satisfactorily served, however, until we establish fully the real reasons that two senior judges, entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing the law of the land, dispensing justice and upholding the Constitution, broke the very laws and flouted the Constitution they were entrusted to uphold. Mr. O'Flaherty's intervention, in the words of the Chief Justice, damaged &ldquo;the administration of justice&rdquo;. Mr. Kelly's handling of the case &ldquo;compromised the administration of justice&rdquo;. Both judges, Mr. O'Flaherty, by his personal intervention, and Mr. Kelly, in his hearing and handling of the case, perverted the course of justice. Judges are not above the law. Both judges are clearly guilty of serious criminal offences.</P>
    <P>In many other jurisdictions, a police inquiry would have been instituted and charges brought. In this jurisdiction, however, we do things differently. We carry out a limited damage limitation exercise, award handsome pensions to persons whose actions undermined the Constitution and almost brought about a downfall of the Government and offer one of the judges involved a senior executive banking position in Europe.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House proposes an investigation be carried out by a judge from another jurisdiction who will have full powers of compellability. Compellability is important because we must ensure the investigation will be comprehensive and conclusive. The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights attempted the voluntary route but with no success. Members will recall that Mr. O'Flaherty felt compelled to write to the joint committee, while still a serving Supreme Court judge, offering to make a full statement and answer all questions. However, having resigned from office on threat of impeachment he changed his mind. His letter to the committee dated 5 June 1999 stated that he could not assist the joint committee because, under the Constitution, as a former judge, he is independent and not accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas or any other institution of the State for his conduct in the exercise of his judicial functions. However, on 21 June this year, in the midst of the controversy regarding his proposed nomination to the European Investment Bank, Mr. O'Flaherty had no difficulty in making himself available for extensive interviews on Today FM and TV3.</P>
    <P>In Mr. O'Flaherty's case there never was any question of the independence of the Judiciary being infringed or any constitutional impediment being in place. In his unwarranted interference in the Sheedy case he was not exercising a judicial function. Mr. O'Flaherty, therefore, must be compelled to attend and rendered accountable for the very serious charge of which he stands indicted by the Chief Justice, namely, that he damaged the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> In the case of Mr. Kelly, it must be established why a judge of such high standing should uncharacteristically deviate from the standards he so rigorously applied previously. Mr. Kelly must be asked if he knew Mr. Sheedy or Mr. Sheedy's family and who approached him on Mr. Sheedy's behalf in order to influence him to hear a case of which he knew full well he did not have seisin. Mr. Kelly must be asked under oath if there was any contact between himself and Mr. O'Flaherty. He must be asked why he took such an extraordinary and deep personal interest in Mr. Sheedy's welfare. Mr. Kelly must also be asked to explain the difference and contradictions in his version of events and that of Judge Joseph Matthews. He must be asked to explain why he called the case out of sequence and why he pretended to the court that he had an up-to-date psychological report before him when such was not the case. Mr. Kelly must be asked to elaborate on the contact between him and the former county registrar in relation to the wrongful listing of the case.</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Quinlan, former county registrar, in fairness had agreed to make himself available to the joint committee. To some extent he is a victim in the entire affair in that it could be presumed that when approached by a judge of the Supreme Court to list a case he felt compromised and under pressure. This is acknowledged by the Chief Justice's report, where Mr. Hamilton concludes &ldquo;I am satisfied, therefore, that had Mr. Justice O'Flaherty not spoken to the County Registrar, he the County Registrar, would not have telephoned the accused's solicitor and opened the possibility of the case being relisted.&rdquo;  Nevertheless Mr. Quinlan knew he was breaking court rules.</P>
    <P>Mr. Quinlan's evidence could well be crucial in unveiling some of the unexplored aspects of the case. What is of particular significance is the letter of 12 April 1999 from Mr. Michael Staines, solicitor for Sheedy, to the Chief Justice. In the letter Mr. Staines recounts the telephone call he received from Mr. Quinlan querying when he would make application for a review of sentence for Philip Sheedy and that Judge Cyril Kelly was awaiting the application. Mr. Staines goes on to recall &ldquo;I asked Michael Quinlan what this was all about and he indicated to me, you don't want to know.&rdquo;  It is quite obvious that this comment has considerable significance. Does it relate to the approach he had received from Supreme Court Judge O'Flaherty or his contact with Judge Cyril Kelly or does it also relate to somebody or something else? What must be established, therefore, is what Mr. Quinlan meant by the comment and who else had made contact with him regarding the listing of the case.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious requirement to investigate the involvement of the other key personalities in the affair. No investigation has been carried out into the alleged role of Mr. Ken Anderson. All we have is Mr. O'Flaherty's version of events in which he states &ldquo;sometime late last year I casually <Col N="316" /> encountered a son of a family friend and neighbours, Mr. Ken Anderson, who was accompanied by a sister of Mr. Sheedy. This encounter was entirely by chance. They gave me an outline of the facts of Mr. Sheedy's case&rdquo;. What we do not have is the version of Mr. Anderson or Mr. Sheedy's sister of this chance encounter.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to establish the full extent of the role of Mr. Philip Sheedy Senior. One can certainly understand a parent's desire to have his son released from prison at the earliest possible stage. The new inquiry will need to hear from Mr. Sheedy Senior regarding the contacts he made with various persons on his son's behalf.</P>
    <P>The absence of the representative of the Chief State Solicitor's office from the court when the Sheedy case was called is another of the unsolved mysteries surrounding this case. The Chief State Solicitor was represented on the day by a Ms Eileen Creedon. In his letter to the Chief Justice dated 6 April 1999 the Chief State Solicitor, Michael A. Buckley, states &ldquo;Ms Creedon was called out of court to answer the telephone. While Ms Creedon was absent at the telephone, item number 19 (the Sheedy case) was called by Judge Kelly.&rdquo;  The case was called out of sequence, lasted little more than one minute or so and everything was over and Mr. Sheedy released by the time Ms Creedon returned. What has not been established is who telephoned Ms Creedon, whether the telephone call happened to be &ndash; depending on one's perspective &ndash; an unhappy or happy coincidence of timing or whether it was a deliberate decoy. The investigation will need to hear from Ms Creedon the circumstances surrounding the telephone call.</P>
    <P>Also important to the new investigation will be Mr. Brian McGreary, law clerk in the Chief State Solicitor's Office, Mr. P. J. Ó Braonáin of the Central Criminal Court, Mr. Brendan O'Donnell of the Circuit Criminal office, Mr. Michael O'Donnell, registrar at the Circuit Criminal Court, and Mr. Sheedy's original legal team, Mr. Luigi Rea, and Mr. Michael Staines, solicitor. It goes without saying that the new inquiry will be most interested in what the accused, Mr. Philip Sheedy, will have to say.</P>
    <P>One of the fascinating aspects of the Sheedy case was the number of politicians, all members of Fianna Fáil, who took an interest in his welfare and had different levels of involvement. We recall that the Sheedy affair almost brought about the downfall of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and precipitated a stand-off between members of the Administration for a number of hours. The Taoiseach must indicate why he made representations on Mr. Sheedy's behalf. Former Deputy Jim Tunney and Deputy Brian Lenihan must also state the level of their involvement in this matter. We must also investigate the role of former Fianna Fáil councillor, Joe Burke, who had an intense business relationship with Mr. Sheedy.</P>
    <P>All aspects of and everyone involved in this <Col N="317" /> case must be thoroughly investigated. We have a public duty to ensure that this happens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;notes the reports of the three separate inquiries in connection with the early release from prison of Mr. Philip Sheedy, namely, the report of the Chief Justice, the report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the report of the Chief State Solicitor's office;</P>
      <P>&ndash;notes the reports of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in relation to this matter;</P>
      <P>&ndash;notes the report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in respect of the courts and Judiciary;</P>
      <P>&ndash;looks forward to considering the forthcoming report of the judicial committee which is examining the question of judicial conduct,</P>
      <P>and requests the Government to continue to examine the constitutional, legislative and other initiatives which may be required in relation to the matters dealt with in these reports.</P>
      <P>There are two distinct elements to the set of circumstances which has become known as the Sheedy affair. The first, the one which gives rise to this debate, is the public interest element. There is no doubt that this case raised serious questions about our judicial system and judicial accountability. Lessons must be learned from what happened and changes need to be made on foot of it. This is being done, as I will explain in more detail later.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a second element to the Sheedy case, that is, the human element. A number of families have been profoundly affected by what happened in this case. First and foremost, there is the Ryan family who were most grievously damaged by the loss of a wife and mother. None of us should ever forget that in the midst of all the comment and controversy theirs has been the gravest and most serious loss of all. Then there are the two judges and court official whose careers were ended arising from the case. While we all fully recognise that it was necessary to examine and debate the issues of public policy which arose from the Sheedy case, we must be mindful of the trauma which all these families have experienced and avoid, to the maximum extent possible, anything which could serve only to add to their suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was one of the issues to which the Oireachtas joint committee adverted. Deputies opposite will recognise the validity of the point. I could understand their wish to proceed to a further inquiry &ndash; even at the expense of further <Col N="318" /> trauma for the families involved &ndash; if there was any reason to believe that such an inquiry would throw any more light on the motives of the parties involved than all of the inquiries which have taken place to date, but even if there were some motives which were not disclosed to the Chief Justice or the other inquiries that took place, what likelihood is there that matters which remained undisclosed throughout the entire period since the Sheedy case first came to public attention would now suddenly be made known? </P>
    <P>In this context, the Oireachtas joint committee reported on 24 June 1999 and stated at paragraph 36 that, unfortunately, it found itself unable to inquire further into the circumstances surrounding the early release from prison of Mr. Sheedy for the legal, constitutional and other reasons already stated. The committee had the benefit and services of a very experienced senior counsel. The comments adverted to by Deputy Shatter were made by me on 20 April 1999. This should have been pointed out by him.</P>
    <P>The point is that we have already been through a varied and extensive inquiry process, one conducted by the most senior member of the Judiciary, and we would need to have some tangible evidence that specific matters were not disclosed by witnesses and some reason to hope that a further inquiry would throw some further light on the situation before we could justify the initiation of what undoubtedly would be a very expensive process which could run to millions of pounds, all paid for by the taxpayer. Nobody could reasonably expect the taxpayer to fund an inquiry on something approaching a wing and a prayer basis that information which eluded previous inquiries would somehow emerge on this occasion. There would also be the prospect of court challenges, given the nature of the type of inquiry envisaged. An expensive and time consuming process of this kind might still be justified if it were the case that the judges concerned were still serving on the bench, but, as we are all aware, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>All the available facts surrounding this case have been outlined to the House by me on several occasions over the past 18 months and are in the public domain. My colleagues and I have made a great many statements to the House in relation to the Sheedy case. The issues raised have all been vigorously and fully pursued. There were three separate inquiries and all their findings have been published. Even if we all agreed that it would now be sensible and justifiable to hold another inquiry &ndash; the Government's clear view is that it is not justifiable &ndash; I am very surprised at the suggestion that it be conducted by a judge from another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to refer back to comments made by Deputy Higgins in the House on 20 April 1999 in this regard. He said &ldquo;The Hamilton report shows clearly that the Judiciary has the capacity to be incisively and piercingly self-critical&rdquo;. The Chief Justice in his report expressed it as his opinion that the actions of one judge damaged <Col N="319" /> the administration of justice. In the other case, the judge's actions, according to the Chief Justice, compromised the administration of justice. The two judges subsequently resigned.</P>
    <P>Against that background, why do Deputies opposite now believe the truth will not be established unless we get a foreign judge to probe the matter? While it can hardly have been intended, their proposal to engage a foreign judge is open to the interpretation that among our own Judiciary, one of the main organs of the State, there is not a single judge capable of conducting this inquiry in an independent and impartial way. I do not want to labour this point nor do I want to turn this debate into a political point scoring exercise, but the proposers of the motion should make it clear that they did not intend any slight on the entire Irish bench.</P>
    <P>Turning to the original motion, the Government has not shirked for one moment the responsibility of instituting public inquiries when the situation has demanded it. We have acted in this way regardless of the cost factor or the longevity factor because we foresaw the possibility of an end result. In this case, on the basis of all the information now available, there is no realistic basis for expecting that an inquiry based on legislation as yet unspecified would add to the information already obtained from all the people involved, following no less than three previous inquiries and reports and a further report by the joint Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>Under the Fine Gael motion the Government would be required to draft complex legislation which, by its very nature, would raise difficult constitutional issues. We would then be obliged to allocate scarce Oireachtas time for the passage of the legislation. Finally, we would embark on an inquiry which would have no realistic prospect of adding to what we already know from all the information available. There is no evidence &ndash; at least none of which I am aware &ndash; to suggest that there is any extra information available and the four reports to which I referred pointed very clearly to that conclusion. The Government has performed its duty in that regard and will move on to implementing change in the system where this is required.</P>
    <P>I strongly reject any suggestion that the Government's response to this matter has been lacking. The Government acted promptly and correctly. All the facts known to the Government were made known to the House on the numerous occasions on which this matter was debated last year. The reports show that the inquiries were extensive from the moment I was first informed of the case.</P>
    <P>It is useful to dwell on certain aspects of the Oireachtas joint committee report. On the question of a parliamentary inquiry, the committee anticipated serious difficulties in attempting to define the concept of judicial functions. It concluded that any further inquiries in this area would enter uncharted constitutional terrain <Col N="320" /> fraught with legal difficulty and the virtual certainty of a legal challenge. The committee also looked at the possibilities of establishing a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts. It saw similar difficulties in this approach, particularly as regards the issue of the chairmanship of such a tribunal. While the prospect of a judge from another jurisdiction was mentioned as a possible solution, the committee concluded that such an inquiry would find itself entering the same uncharted constitutional terrain with the same legal difficulties. It went on to conclude &ndash; this is important because the committee reported in June 1999 &ndash; that a tribunal of inquiry would stand little prospect of bringing matters to a satisfactory conclusion. That was the view of the committee. I, therefore, pose the question, why&mdash;</P>

      <P>It appears that they should be noted. Members on the benches opposite have said that many questions remain unanswered and questioned what the Government will do to resolve the matter. I am not aware of any mechanism within the law which would guarantee to all and sundry all the answers to all the questions that could be posed about this or any other set of circumstances of its kind. The fact that questions remain unanswered does not, in itself, provide justification for another inquiry as there would also have to be some grounds for believing that such a further inquiry would achieve results <Col N="321" /> which eluded previous inquiries. I am not aware of any such grounds.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Hamilton's report outlines the facts as he discovered them. As we are aware, he brought forward his conclusions on the undisputed facts and indicated that his inquiry could not go further. My Department's inquiry also set out the facts that it was able to establish. All three individuals involved have categorically stated that they did nothing improper. There is no suggestion of motivation by personal gain or reward. I cannot go further than this for the simple reason that I am no more in a position to go behind what the individuals have said by way of explanation for their actions than anybody else inside or outside the House.</P>
      <P>All in all, there seems to be no doubt that the only right and sensible course at this stage is to look forward. From the very beginning the Government made it crystal clear that its priority was to ensure something like this would not happen again and that is the basis of the Government motion. Our strategy has been simply to act on the recommendations or the points raised in the various reports which have already been completed.</P>
      <P>The Government has been engaged in bringing forward a comprehensive programme of change and reform in the system to ensure that, as far as possible, we will never have a recurrence of this type of event. To begin with, the issue of judicial conduct is something which the Government, in consultation with the Judiciary, is committed to fully examining. As the House is aware, we now have the benefit of the work of the all-party committee on this matter. I am sure that on all sides of the House there is agreement on the need for change in this area. In essence, the position is that there is only one form of disciplinary action for stated misbehaviour by a member of the Judiciary, which is in effect impeachment. It is an all or nothing situation which has its own constitutional and legal difficulties as far as the Oireachtas is concerned in terms of parliamentary procedure.</P>
      <P>The all-party report on the Constitution examined many issues, including the appointment and removal of judges and judicial conduct and ethics. It also deals with questions such as the judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation and the constitutionality of Bills and laws and related matters. The report covers many areas of public life and its recommendations and conclusions in respect of the Constitution have implications for all Departments. The Government will, therefore, carefully consider this report in that broad context and in tandem with the recommendations contained in other reports from the all-party committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matters relating to the Judiciary which are covered in the report, I have completed a preliminary examination of the report and very much welcome the contribution it has made to the debate on these questions. It is important to acknowledge that we have all been <Col N="322" /> obliged to rethink our positions in relation to the crucial issue of judicial conduct. The Judiciary has not been silent on this matter and only recently the Chief Justice indicated that in his view, the current structures for dealing with this issue were inadequate. He went on to say there is a compelling case that there should be some form of body which would be able to adopt different remedies depending on the precise circumstances which have given rise to some complaint or concern about members of the Judiciary. This is a very positive message which we should take on board on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice also referred to the reputation of the Judiciary which he considered stood very high. He felt that people's view of the Judiciary was not shaped by an unusual event such as the Sheedy case but by what actually happens in the courts throughout the country every day. I concur with that view. My guiding principle is to ensure that the service provided in our courts, in all parts of the country, is efficient, effective and beyond reproach. I will refer later to the initiatives which we have taken in that regard.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the judicial committee established in response to the Sixth Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission is also currently examining the question of judicial conduct and ethics with a view to publishing a separate report. I look forward to receiving that report and using the work already completed by the all-party committee. The Government will be in a position to finalise its consideration of all the constitutional and other issues involved in this important area.</P>
    <P>The committee has considered the position in other jurisdictions and has consulted me, the Bar Council, the Law Society, academics and others; it will also receive submissions from interested bodies. Furthermore, it will advise on and prepare the way for the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct and establish a system for the handling of complaints relating to such conduct. It will do other preparatory work, including that relating to judicial standards and ethics, and will consider matters which have arisen since the sixth report was finalised in November 1998.</P>
    <P>All these matters raise serious and complex issues to which the Ceann Comhairle has alluded in correspondence with other party leaders. There is the question of fair procedures in relation to the impeachment process as set down in Article 35.4 of the Constitution. In addition, the role of the joint committee is not clear in matters of this nature. In response to the views expressed by the Ceann Comhairle, the Government has moved to try to establish some clarity in relation to dealing with crises of this nature.</P>
    <P>The report of my Department made a number of recommendations in relation to institutional and procedural changes in the courts designed to prevent any recurrence of the events which led to the early release from prison of Mr. Sheedy. These recommendations dealt with issues such as <Col N="323" /> the performance of duties by court staff, judicial conduct and ethics, the method of appointment of county registrars, the assignment of cases to particular judges, court rules and the formal transfer of responsibility for the administration of the Courts Service to the new Courts Board. Some of these recommendations have already been implemented and other recommendations will be the subject of proposals to be brought before Government in due course.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the issue of judicial conduct and ethics and the work that has been carried out in that regard. Apart from that, in terms of bringing about real change, a most important milestone was achieved when I established the Courts Service one year ago. That service is up and running and is, I am glad to say, showing itself to be a considerable success and a driver of much needed change. It is achieving its aim, which is the provision of an efficient, effective and accountable service to judges, practitioners, court staff, and, most importantly, the users of the courts system. This is the most radical reform of court administration since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The statutory framework of the Courts Service establishes clear lines of accountability, responsibility and transparency. Under the Court Service Act, 1998, responsibility for the management of the courts system is now conferred on the Courts Service while political accountability for the activities of the service will continue to rest with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is as it should be. The Government, through the major investment programme in both information systems and buildings, has demonstrated its commitment to ensure that the Courts Service will have the necessary resources to discharge its responsibilities and at the same time support the judicial system.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the system which existed heretofore may have been sufficient in the past but was no longer adequate to meet the demands arising from the volume of business now coming before our courts. Nor was it equipped to meet the kind of public expectations which are now faced by all major publicly funded services. The establishment of the Courts Service has centralised the financial management and administration of the courts in a unified system which will focus on the provision of an efficient, effective and user friendly service capable of meeting the needs of modern society. It will ensure that the changes, which are required to improve access to the courts and to respond to the needs of all court users, will be made promptly.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of the integrity of court officials, the role of officials in processing court business remains an important issue for the Courts Service. The service is committed to applying principles of equal treatment and equal consideration in all dealings concerning court business. Particular attention has been paid to this issue in the course of training programmes for new staff joining the service and newly <Col N="324" /> appointed clerks in charge who have specific responsibilities in overseeing junior staff and liaising with members of the Judiciary on listing and other court business management.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Courts Service to enshrining the requisite principles of equality, fairness and integrity in its operations will be reinforced in the forthcoming launch of its first strategic plan. This plan will set out key objectives of the service over the next three years and the strategies to achieve them. I understand that the experience gained in the course of this case has greatly informed the service in reviewing its practices and procedures and in setting appropriate guiding principles and values for application in pursuit of its remit. In this regard the service is currently preparing a code of conduct for its staff. I look forward to receiving the first Courts Service strategic plan later this month and I welcome the opportunity this affords to address the issue of professional standards and quality service to which the Courts Service is committed in administering court operations.</P>
    <P>The appointment of county registrars is now made with the aid of a system of open public competition following the establishment by me of an appointments advisory board. Three such appointments have been made in the last year through that system. The matters relating to the assignment of cases to judges and the procedures in the criminal courts have been looked at by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. Its report is being examined by my Department. On the question of the transfer of the Criminal Solicitor Service from the Office of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to the direct control of the Director of Public Prosecutions as mentioned in the report of the Chief State Solicitor into the Sheedy affair, last year the public prosecution system study report recommended this approach and the Government has accepted that it is the right course to follow. Discussions are new continuing between all the interested parties with a view to the early implementation of this important initiative.</P>
    <P>Nobody can afford to underestimate the importance of the issues raised in this debate. They are matters of fundamental importance to the body politic and as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I will ensure that they remain top of my Department's agenda. Accordingly, using as a basis all the reports that have gone before and the work which has yet to be completed, the Government will consider all constitutional, legislative, administrative or other initiatives which can help us to secure what we all wish to copperfasten, that is, the complete integrity of our criminal justice system. The Government has made significant progress in arriving at that result over the past year. There is still some work to be done but we have established a firm foundation for the completion of our task.</P>
    <P>In opposing the motion, I am not questioning the sincerity of those who proposed it. While there is a view that the Sheedy affair, so-called, is <Col N="325" /> being kept alive for motives which are unworthy &ndash; some would say that the motive is purely political &ndash; I do not wish to bring this important debate down to the level to which it would undoubtedly descend if I were to base my opposition on that proposition. For the avoidance of any doubt on the matter, I emphasise that neither I nor the Government is aware of any basis for suggesting or implying that what happened in this case was the result of political interference or political favouritism in any manner, shape or form from Deputies on any side of the House.</P>
    <P>I oppose the motion, therefore, not for any narrow political reasons but simply because the Government genuinely and honestly believes that the setting up of an inquiry of the kind envisaged, whether chaired by an Irish or non-Irish judge, would be extremely unlikely to uncover facts or motives so far undisclosed in the course of all the other inquiries which have taken place, one of these inquiries having been conducted by the State's most senior judge. The Government could not support the setting up of what would undoubtedly be a very expensive process with no realistic prospect of producing benefit for anybody, apart, perhaps for members of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the Government's proposed appointment of the former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty as a member of the European Investment Bank. He will recall that the Green Party announced its intention to nominate economist, Mr. Richard Douthwaite, for the position of vice-president of the European Investment Bank. Fine Gael stated at the time that it would support this appointment and that it would, in fact, contact the European People's Party Group in the European Parliament to seek its support for the nomination. The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton, stated that Mr. Douthwaite's credentials would enhance Ireland's standing in Europe. In this regard, it would perhaps be somewhat instructive to ascertain what precisely Mr. Douthwaite's credentials are. I understand he is a radical left-wing writer, economist and environmentalist and I have no doubt that his views would surprise many traditional Fine Gael voters.</P>
    <P>In a recent essay entitled &ldquo;The Best Way There&rdquo;, Mr. Douthwaite predicted that:</P>
    <P>Neither the present generation nor the next are likely to accept that big differences between rich and poor are the will of God. Consequently, the Marxist view is certain to re-emerge.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of an ideal economic system, Mr. Douthwaite advocates equality and sustainability as the common ground on which reds and greens can unite. It is simply the best way. I have no doubt that Deputies Higgins and Shatter would fully endorse those sentiments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion tabled by the Fine Gael party is of significant importance as it relates to a matter which caused extraordinary tidal waves in the legal profession and this country's judicial system. It also caused huge uproar in the body politic and brought politics into potentially direct conflict with the Judiciary for the first time in the history of the State. We were faced with a potential constitutional crisis and with the threat of impeachment, by a sovereign Government, of one of the most senior judicial personages in this country.</P>
      <P>All sides have acknowledged that this extremely important issue is based on human tragedy, namely the tragic death of Mrs. Ann Ryan, the inordinate pain which befell her family and the ripples of pain that spread from that to virtually every other person who was touched by this appalling saga. The response we have had from the Minister tonight, in seeking to reduce this most serious issue to some form of political pantomime, is disgraceful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first time we have had that from the Minister. During a Private Members' debate on the Omagh bombing, another appalling tragedy and a serious matter, when the Minister could not be present, which I accept, his Minister of State came to the House and insulted it by reading a Second Stage script on legislation enacted two years ago. At least the Minister of State had the good grace to recognise that position was intolerable and she terminated her speech early. Tonight the Minister has not addressed this most serious issue with the gravity and seriousness it demands and warrants from him as the person responsible for maintaining <Col N="329" /> public confidence in the administration of justice and the judicial system. I say this sincerely because I expected more from the Minister.</P>
      <P>That there are a plethora of unanswered questions surrounding what is called the Sheedy saga is clear to everybody. Acres of newsprint have been used listing those questions, some of which were again listed by both Fine Gael spokespersons who have contributed to the debate, namely, Deputies Shatter and Jim Higgins. There are real and fundamental questions which cannot be allowed to glide into the firmament until they disappear.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party to this issue from the outset has been extraordinary. Tonight the Minister told the House that further inquiries might be justified if the judges concerned were still on the bench. The argument is that have no questions to answer, that if justice is compromised and mechanisms are faulty no further investigation is required if they resign; that nobody else can be called to account or explain the procedures which led to the threat of impeachment and that all is hunky-dory because they resigned. Why do we have a constitutional right to impeach if people can simply forestall all further examination and questioning by a simple mechanism of resignation? It is wholly unacceptable and wrong.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his concluding remarks, before he embarked upon some sort of financial pantomime that the reason the Government decided to amend the motion was that it was unlikely to get further facts. On the face of it, if the Minister believes that then it is a tenable reason to say this course of action may not be the best. However, is he putting forward an alternative or is he simply following a pattern of Fianna Fáil decisions on this issue which determines that they do not want to find out any more? That suspicion must now be real in the minds of those listening to the Minister tonight and those who have observed the pattern of Fianna Fáil action on this issue from the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was quite disingenuous in saying we have an all-party agreement in relation to the report of the Oireachtas committee. I favoured a judicial inquiry at the committee, as did my Fine Gael colleagues, but we were a minority on the committee. The Minister omitted to put that fact on the record of the House. I took this position not because I was convinced we would get to the full truth through that mechanism, but because I was determined to find a mechanism to get to the truth. The Minister has a particular responsibility to address the net issues which have caused deep disquiet in the body politic. If that lesson has not yet impacted on the Minister, then it has impacted on the Taoiseach, having listened to him answer questions and on the Order of Business today. The Taoiseach realised when he tried to promote the former judge, Mr. O'Flaherty, to the vice-presidency of the European Investment Bank, how outrageous a proposition it was and the regard the public had for it, coming as it did <Col N="330" /> less than a year after the Government proposed, suggested or threatened the judge's impeachment.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows there was an all-party view to seek to get at the full truth of this affair, to seek to answer all the questions, which I will not take up time by listing but which have been listed in the acres of newsprint, including in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i>. That these matters should be left unanswered because there is no suitable mechanism is not an appropriate or acceptable response.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee took advice from senior counsel, as the Minister has acknowledged. Six suggestions were put and examined by the committee. The first was that we would embark upon an informal inquiry, although the weakness of that was that we had no powers to compel. However, we did seek to invite the principals to give evidence to the committee. Mr. O'Flaherty's initial response to the committee in a letter of 16 April 1999, addressed to the then chairman of the justice committee, Deputy Eoin Ryan, now Minister of State, stated:</P>
    <P>I wish to take this, the earliest opportunity, to express my deep regret for my own inappropriate and unwise action. Despite my humanitarian motivation, which the Chief Justice has very fairly acknowledged, I accept that this action has left my position open to misinterpretation and in that way damaged the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>In two subsequent interviews given to selected elements of the media Mr. O'Flaherty resiled entirely from this position. He said:</P>
    <P>I am now concerned to fully explain my position, especially in the light of the many aspects of the case new to me which the Chief Justice's report has elicited. I do this in an attempt to dispel as far as possible the doubt and the suspicion which has accumulated around the Sheedy case in the interests of the community, justice and in my own interests. To that end, and in view of the widespread concern and many questions surrounding the case [these are the words of Mr. O'Flaherty] it is thought appropriate to make a statement to the committee on justice, equality and women's affairs and to answer any and all questions its members may raise.</P>
    <P>Yet it was subsequently found impossible for him to come &ndash; he found it unconstitutional to come before the committee.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I sought to have a fresh invitation issued to Mr. O'Flaherty to come before the committee informally and voluntarily to exercise the views he expressed, to set the record straight and to answer any and all questions which members of the committee may raise.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil members of the committee voted it down in an amendment to my resolution dated 27 June 2000. My resolution was to invite Mr. O'Flaherty voluntarily to come and explain <Col N="331" /> all the unanswered questions. Two of the Fianna Fáil members of the committee, Senator Denis O'Donovan and Deputy Marian McGennis, sponsored an amendment to basically delete all words involved and substitute a reaffirmation of the previous report. Therefore, the prospect of inviting Mr. O'Flaherty to exercise his wish to set the record straight was killed off by Fianna Fáil. Why did the two members, acting as I understand at the behest of the Government Whip, make that decision, whip everybody in to vote and not even allow an invitation to go out to Mr. O'Flaherty to come and explain the unanswered questions? If the Minister acknowledges, as I thought he did, that there are unanswered questions, and certainly the Taoiseach said in his interview on Today FM there were unanswered questions, where is the harm in inviting the principals in to begin to explain the litany of actions that resulted in such a damaging impact on the administration of justice? I do not understand why Fianna Fáil took the stand it did. Certainly, it is not in the interests of public confidence in the judicial system or in understanding fully who exactly was involved in the sequence of events that led to the sorry saga now known as the Sheedy affair.</P>
    <P>Other options were looked at in relation to answering those questions which are acknowledged to be outstanding. The committee looked at the option to seek powers to send for persons, papers and records. Unfortunately, it appears that no powers could be given to compel judges to come before the committee in any event. That is a clear flaw in the 1997 compellability of witnesses legislation. A third option presented was to amend the 1997 Act to include judges acting outside their constitutionally preserved judicial function &ndash; a point made rather well by Deputy Shatter. A fourth suggestion was a constitutional amendment to include judicial functions into the purview of the committee. All of these are fraught with difficulty. Most of us on the committee wanted to preserve the constitutional independence of judges to act judicially. It seems to me and, I think, to the majority of the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that it cannot be right that any public servant &ndash; judges are ultimately public servants &ndash; once appointed can drift into an untouchable state where even if they act in a peculiar way they are not amenable to questioning and where the only sanction available under the Constitution is the nuclear button or impeachment. Even the impeachment process is not prescribed by law. It is a deficiency that should be addressed in a calmer time so that should a threat of impeachment need to be acted upon the framework for activating it would be in place.</P>
    <P>In this age of transparency when every public servant would be required to explain his or her actions &ndash; it is a good thing in their own interests to be able to do that &ndash; judges should not only <Col N="332" /> have that responsibility but that facility. It was clear that Mr. Justice Matthews would have been very anxious to explain his role in all of this.</P>
    <P>The fifth avenue of inquiry the committee looked at was the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry under the 1921 Act. Although I favoured that as the most acceptable of the options at that time, there may well be a difficulty in summoning judges to account for what can be classified as judicial functions even at a tribunal of inquiry, although it is my understanding that judicial functioning is quite understood in the law as exercising those functions that could only be done by a judge and they are quite narrow in legal understanding.</P>
    <P>The last option looked at was to ask the Chief Justice to recommence his investigation. They were the avenues that presented themselves to us and our legal advisers to explore further the truth. We did not manage to bring the issue further. It is frustrating for every member of the committee that there are unanswered questions that the public and certainly those involved in the running of the administration of the courts require to be answered, and we have no mechanism to do it.</P>
    <P>This issue arose again after a period of being placed on the back burner with the extraordinary attempt by the Government to appoint Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty to the vice-presidency of the European Investment Bank. When the issue was raised again many of us were determined that the matter could not be closed down with those questions unanswered for a second time. That is the reason I sought to use the committee itself as the vehicle to address those unanswered questions by invitation in the first instance to see if that could be responded to by all the participants. That was closed down yet again by a vote of the Fianna Fáil members of the committee which I regard as inexplicable to this day.</P>
    <P>I commenced by saying this is a narrow issue in the sense that it relates to one series of sad and dreadful events but it has opened a vista that is much more general and important in its wider application, that is public accountability by the Judiciary. It is my considered view now that it is not good enough to allow the oversight of the Judiciary to lie exclusively in the hands of the members of the Judiciary. We need to go further. We may well need a constitutional amendment to allow for the enactment of legislation establishing a standards in judicial office basis analogous to the Standards in Public Office Act that applies to ourselves, a range of senior public servants and civil servants.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Genetic Testing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being present. Last month the British Govern<Col N="333" /> ment announced that insurance companies will be allowed to use the results of genetic tests to identify people with hereditary illnesses. The British Government was acting on advice from the genetics and insurance committee, an advisory body reporting to the Department of Health in Britain, which believes that by allowing insurers to have access to genetic information it may benefit some people.</P>
      <P>Initially testing is to be requested for Huntingdon's Disease. Insurers in the UK have legal permission to ask new policy holders whether they have taken a gene test for a fatal degenerative disorder such as Huntingdon's Disease and to acquire the results of the test. What is one to do if one has a family history of such a disease? Should one not take the test so that one can truthfully answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; when filling out one's insurance application and take the risk of not taking a gene test and identifying whether one is at risk of developing an inheritable disease?</P>
      <P>The initial request from the insurer only relates to Huntingdon's Disease but hereditary breast cancer and Alzheimer's Disease are expected to follow. Britain is the first country to allow insurers to use results of genetic tests to identify people with hereditary illness and in doing so the British Government rejected advice from its human genetic advisory commission which recommended a moratorium on the use of information from tests for genetic illnesses.</P>
      <P>Other countries such as Holland, France and Norway have banned the use of gene tests by insurers, as has the United States. Genetic information is private and should not be used to reduce the risk insurance companies must bear. They are in the business of taking risks. Those who take out insurance are already required under insurance company law to reveal details of their medical history but the question of requesting a genetic make up is a completely different scenario.</P>
      <P>Regardless of how the insurance companies in the UK are regulated we should not allow such a scenario to arise in Ireland where those seeking life assurance could be discriminated against on the basis of their genetic make-up. Given that many of the life assurance companies operating in Ireland are UK-based it is important we are clear on how they must operate here with regard to genetic information.</P>
      <P>Irish-based insurance companies can request or require an individual to give up gene test results. There is nothing preventing them doing so. However, they are not doing so yet, but unless there is action it may be too late. The majority of geneticists worldwide are opposed to the use of genetic information by insurance companies. It was unanimously decided at the international congress of geneticists held in Birmingham a number of years ago that genetic information should in principle be private and health insurance companies should be prevented from using genetic tests to adjust premia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> Genetics is racing ahead but genetic testing needs to be regulated. If eminent geneticists are advising us to do so, why has it not been done? I have questioned the Minister of State on this subject previously and he said legislation is not required yet. We must prepare for the regulation of genetic testing, however, to ensure there will not be discrimination on the basis of one's genetic make-up. It is only a matter of time before there will be screening for genetic diseases.</P>
    <P>The decision taken in Britain could have major consequences for us in Ireland. The Government must act without hesitation to prohibit discrimination by life insurance companies on the basis of one's genetic make-up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of genetic testing is of great importance for public policy as it involves complex issues, including public health issues, protection of personal data, insurance solvency and consumer protection. As the Deputy may be already aware, the insurance industry in Ireland does not request information about those proposing for life assurance policies.</P>
      <P>The Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, ICSTI, which operates under Forfás, has established a task force on biotechnology. The task force has recently been examining, among others, the issue of genetic testing. The Irish Insurance Federation has prepared a draft code of practice on genetic testing for its members and discussions are currently ongoing between the task force and the IIF in relation the draft code of practice.</P>
      <P>Our officials have also been consulted by the IIF about the draft code of practice. The draft code sets out the conduct to be followed by the industry in Ireland in regard to use of genetic tests and seeks to balance the legitimate interests of insurers and of the totality of policy holders with the concerns of individual consumers. Our understanding is that the industry intends that applicants for insurance policies will not be required to undergo a genetic test to obtain insurance.</P>
      <P>However, in accordance with current requirements that a client act with utmost good faith, life assurers expect individuals, who have previously undertaken a genetic test, to disclose full details at application stage. This is to protect the insurance company from being selected against and to protect other insurance policy holders, who would have to pay more into the insurance pool. The industry is prepared to agree to ignore the results of genetic testing in respect of mortgage protection policies up to a limit to be determined. No one will be required to disclose the result of a genetic test taken after the policy is taken out nor the test results of any relative. The draft code confirms that existing provisions relating to confidentiality of medical evidence will also apply to genetic information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the initiative by the industry, <Col N="335" /> I am conscious of the need to consider whether Government regulation in this area is warranted. There are complex issues at stake, including public health concerns. Accordingly, I have asked that a process of consultation with interested parties be undertaken by our Department. When this process is completed and we are in a position to consider this matter, having regard to all of the relevant factors, I will consider what, if any, action is required, at that time.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Child Care Services.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter and I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children. I refer to the report of the findings relating to the inspection of children's residential centres, which was completed by the social services inspectorate. A total of 12 centres which provided places for 61 children were inspected. Their ages ranged from four to 17 years. Many of the children have experienced profound loss and many have also suffered abuse and neglect.</P>
      <P>It is important that the highest standards are maintained in these institutions. The work is difficult and personally demanding. I compliment the management and staff for their contribution. However, resources must be made available to ensure the optimum service for these children. Staff expertise and experience in their role is vital to the quality of service. There is concern at the recruitment, retention and training of staff, care planning and review, management and monitoring of residential care services and the support arrangements for children in residential care. This goes to the core of the service. I ask the Minister of State to address his fundamental issue in her reply.</P>
      <P>There is urgent need for improvement in child care training. When will the expert group on various health professionals' recommendation that child care should be accorded a formal professional status and, as a consequence, the recruitment of non-qualified personnel to cease be implemented? The Minister of State must accept there is a need for the introduction of a nationally recognised professional qualification and the provision of in-service training for child care workers.</P>
      <P>It is not acceptable that some centres are being run by staff with limited experience of residential child care. There must a clear career path for child care workers. Employing staff in such a delicate area on a temporary basis is not good enough. One cannot expect staff who are temporary to be as committed to the provision of dedicated care as those who occupy permanent care posts. There is a number of areas where concentrated action by the Minister is necessary if progress is to be achieved in raising the standards of residential child care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must, as a matter for urgency, establish a set of national standards for residen<Col N="336" /> tial child care which would cover both voluntary and statutory sector centres. These standards must also apply to other institutions where children are cared for in out of home residential settings. Will the Minister address the failure of health boards to implement in full the statutory regulations that require a board to prepare a plan for the care of the child, before placing a child in a residential centre or as soon as practicable thereafter? It is not acceptable that inspections to date have shown that care planning is weak and sometimes ignored. This is a most unsatisfactory situation. As the report has pointed out, it can lead to children being allowed to drift in care, when good planning would have identified the matters requiring to be addressed and directed services towards those matters, thus enabling more children to be able to return to their homes or move on with confidence to living independently. Will the Minister accept that without proper care plans which set out the aims and objectives of the residential placement and the support to be provided the child, reviews of the cases of children in care are meaningless? I call on the Minister to guarantee that health boards will address planning and review procedures more seriously in future.</P>
    <P>A further matter of concern is the lack of attention given by the boards to monitoring placements. The responsibility for monitoring of standards is clearly placed upon the health boards by article 17 of the Child Care Regulations, 1995. Various records are required to be maintained to facilitate this activity, but in many cases inspectors discovered that no authorised person had been appointed by the board to undertake the monitoring function. Consequently, managers relied on the accounts of residential managers regarding the standards of care being provided in centres. Normally, the line manager for the centre would be best placed to carry out this function, but it can be delegated to someone else who can, in turn, report the findings of monitoring exercises to the line manager. In some cases, line managers were surprised to learn of the findings of the inspectors. Had they carried out their role regularly they would have had a better idea about how the services were being provided. The board is left in a vulnerable position if it does not ensure regular monitoring of standards. While inspection will provide relevant information for those with responsibility for monitoring, it can only take place periodically. The views of children and their parents are very low in the system's list of priorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for his interest in this matter and for highlighting all the main issues in the report of the social services inspectorate on children's residential centres. The social services inspectorate was established by the Government in April 1999. Its main function is to support the child care services <Col N="337" /> by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards.</P>
      <P>On its establishment, the inspectorate was asked to concentrate initially on residential care, given the concerns which we all share in relation to what happened to children in residential care in the past. A number of structures were developed to assist the inspectorate. First, a steering group representing the Department of Health and Children, nominees of the chief executive officers of the health boards, and the acting director of the social services inspectorate, oversees the operation of the inspectorate.</P>
      <P>A sub-committee was established to develop the draft standards against which children's residential homes are inspected and a second sub-committee was established to develop the inspection process and methodology. With the current staffing of the inspectorate and given the number of health board run residential homes, it was clear that the full programme of inspection would take more than two years. Accordingly, it was decided that at least one formal inspection should take place in each health board area so that lessons learned from the initial inspection could be applied by the health boards to other homes for which they are responsible. This was to focus attention on the issue of good practice, which is a vitally important message to get across.</P>
      <P>The steering group also decided that the most appropriate way of disseminating information as broadly as possible was to compile an overall theme-based report once the initial round of inspections had taken place. This report was formally presented to me on 1 October last. The report is an important and useful document. Its purpose is to highlight areas where quality care is delivered. Like Deputy Neville, I also wish to commend all those people working in residential care who are very committed to their work.</P>
      <P>The report also highlights where improvements can be made in residential care to ensure that children in residential care, who are often vulnerable, are provided with the best care possible. I am pleased to note the report points out that, overall, senior managers and local centre managers welcomed the inspection process. If our system was perfect there would not be any need for an inspectorate. However, like any other system, it is not perfect, and implementing the recommendations of the inspectorate is an important step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Eight key themes are identified in the report. These are care planning; monitoring of standards and placements; recruitment and retention of staff, including staff support and supervision; the development of statements of purpose and function; mechanisms for obtaining the views of children and parents; leaving care policies; complaints procedures; and the establishment of a set of national standards to cover both the voluntary and statutory sector centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each health board is now required to follow up on action points identified or shortcomings in <Col N="338" /> their services, and the social services inspectorate will review progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>A one day conference is planned for all health boards early in the new year to identify and draw together best practice in these areas. This will be an important and timely response to the inspectorate's report.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the numbers of unqualified staff working in residential care and I have asked the steering group to work with the health boards to seek to address this issue as a matter of urgency. There are other significant staffing issues. The changes proposed by the expert group report on various health professions relating to child care workers are being addressed and the Department of Health and Children is involved in ongoing discussions with all health boards in an attempt to regularise the problem of temporary posts in the child care and training areas.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the development of standards which were agreed with the health boards, the social services inspectorate, the Department of Health and Children, and other relevant parties last year. Having road tested the draft national standards during the initial inspection programme, there are now some minor refinements to be made. When this has been done, the draft standards should be reviewed and formally adopted as the standards to apply uniformly to all children's residential homes &ndash; both health board and voluntarily run. This will ensure that both sectors of residential care provide a uniform, high quality service.</P>
    <P>An issue which is of great concern and which is highlighted in the report is care planning. A key issue when a child is taken into care, whether this be residential care or foster care, is the process by which they will leave care, hopefully to be reunited with their families. If there are poor care plans, or no care plans, one can end up with a child drifting within the system. This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that for a child's needs to be met, a care plan is essential. It is particularly important that health boards adhere fully to their statutory responsibilities in this area. There are positive developments in regard to care planning. I understand the inspection and registration service of the Eastern Regional Health Authority recently organised a seminar on care planning and a template for care planning has been agreed.</P>
    <P>The sum of £1 million is being given to the mid-west area to develop programmes for after care, which is also essential. I welcome the inspectorate's report which I regard as a valuable resource to ensure that only the highest quality standards will be given to our children in residential care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis:</NameTxt>
      <P>There could not have been a better time for this matter to be taken on the Adjournment. While the country is being battered by storms and floods, a small army of <Col N="339" /> people turn up in hail, rain and snow at schools throughout the country to ensure that children can safely cross the road at the beginning of their journey home. The job is done mainly by women who are described as &ldquo;lollipop ladies&rdquo; but whose official title is school traffic warden. It is not a glamorous job and only pays about £70 per week. However, it is a vitally important task. Up to this year when schools closed for the summer holidays, the school traffic wardens signed on at the local employment exchange and received payment. I presume that in the Minister's reply I will be told that people who sign on at such exchanges must be actively seeking employment, and I am aware that is one of the criteria laid down. However, in practice, what happened up to this year was that, very sensibly and practically, the people processing the claims in the local labour exchanges realised the value of the work these people were doing and simply paid them the benefit for the duration of the summer holidays. That system operated until this year when a number of the women working as &ldquo;lollipop ladies&rdquo; were told that they had to actively seek full-time employment. Prior to the change in their entitlement to benefit, there was already a crisis in local authorities concerning people who were available and willing to take up work as school traffic wardens. As a result of what I have been told about the changes in the way in which these people are dealt with, that crisis will become more evident as time goes on.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs or both will have to address this issue. If we continue to deal with it the way it was dealt with this summer, it will force women, who in the main do this job, to seek employment in McDonalds or Intel or wherever they can get employment. They will be reluctant as a result to return to the job they were doing because it is not easy. They turn out in the worst possible weathers and do a very important and responsible job. If they do not turn out, it will mean local authorities, the Minister for Education and Science and schools throughout the country will be faced with a crisis with regard to how children will get across the road safely.</P>
      <P>Either the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs recognises the precedent throughout previous summers and allows these people to sign on and receive their benefit or the Minister for Education and Science accepts that that is not appropriate and that they cannot be available for and actively seeking work during the summer and must return to work in September. If that is the case, there is a responsibility on the Minister for Education and Science to pay these people during the summer months they do not work as school wardens. They do not do so not because they do not want to but because the job is not there for them during the summer. They sign on, collect meagre benefit during the summer and go back to the job they enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> It is an important job and not just from the point of view of the safety of children getting across the road. I know from my experience and from my involvement and friendship with women who are school wardens that children often speak to the school warden, the &ldquo;lollipop lady&rdquo;, about problems and concerns they have which they might not approach other people with.</P>
    <P>What happened this summer, where a large number of school wardens &ndash; lollipop ladies &ndash; were told they would not be paid during the summer, to go and get full-time employment or to hang around without being paid and return and do a very valuable job, is not acceptable. It should and must be addressed before the Christmas holidays and before it becomes a crisis for schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGennis for raising this. I appreciate the work of, as she calls them, the &ldquo;lollipop&rdquo; men and women and the safety they guarantee for many children. However, as this is a matter relevant to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I will respond on his behalf regarding the entitlement to unemployment payments of all unemployed people, including school wardens.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work to be entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance. Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an ongoing basis is not entitled to an unemployment payment. In applying the legislation, deciding officers do not treat school wardens, otherwise known as &ldquo;lollipop&rdquo; men and women, any differently from other unemployment benefit or assistance claimants.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and the Minister has no role in such decisions. Statutory Instrument No. 137 of 1998 specifies the circumstances in which a person is or is not deemed to be available for and genuinely seeking employment. Comprehensive guidelines on the application of the availability for and genuinely seeking work conditions for entitlement to unemployment payments are available to deciding officers and to the public on request. The application of these guidelines ensures that the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In applying the legislation, deciding officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality and the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of the wide range of labour market opportunities which exist in the current economic climate. Unemployment benefit and assistance claimants are expected to demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to secure suitable full-time employment and to provide examples of such steps. The steps which people are expected to take to seek employment <Col N="341" /> will vary from person to person and from one period to the next. In determining what are reasonable steps, the deciding officer is advised to consider the nature and conditions of the employment sought and to have regard to the individual circumstances of the persons concerned. Any person available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work is entitled to an unemployment payment. Each case is decided on its own merits within the framework of the relevant social welfare legislation and there is no policy of dealing with school wardens or any other category of school worker in a punitive or discriminatory manner.</P>
    <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer, he or she may appeal this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for being present to respond to this matter at what I know is some inconvenience to him. I am grateful for that because it will be reassuring to the people of Wexford to hear the answer, if he will forgive me for saying it, from the horse's mouth on this difficult issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that the Devereux Hotel in Rosslare Harbour was acquired by his Department to be used as a reception centre for asylum seekers. He also knows that, once that announcement was made as one of a number of acquisitions throughout the country, it provoked considerable controversy locally and was met by some local hostility. Members of the public picketed the hotel and prevented it from being used as a reception centre. That picket has been ongoing from the time of the announcement to date.</P>
      <P>The hotel has been bought and paid for by the State at a considerable cost, yet it has remained idle because of the opposition. It is essential that the State has proper facilities to deal with significant numbers of applicants for asylum which we now receive and that it does so in a fair and humane way. I am also conscious, coming from Wexford, of the burden placed on facilities in the Wexford area because of the number of asylum seekers accessing the State through the port of Rosslare Harbour.</P>
      <P>All the Oireachtas Members in Wexford had been involved in efforts to resolve this difficult problem. However, I understand there have been separate negotiations involving the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, who is also a TD for Wexford, and the asylum division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform bilaterlally negotiating a settlement with those involved in the protest. I and other public representatives of the area have not been involved in these recent negotiations. I regret the uniform approach of the Oireachtas Members has not been followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I understand that, as a result of these <Col N="342" /> negotiations, a deadline was set for the opening of the hotel as a reception centre by Friday of last week, or at least there was agreement to an opening date by last Friday. As I understand it, the proposal is that the hotel would be used for a period of 18 months and would then be sold on the open market as a tourism facility, that it would be used only as a reception centre and not as permanent accommodation for asylum seekers and that it would only be used for short-term stays by those arriving through the port of Rosslare. I further understand that people involved in the protest have been told that, if they do not agree to these proposals, the Devereux Hotel will be handed over to the Prison Service for use as some sort of halfway house for offenders.</P>
    <P>This saga has continued for many months. It has caused division and disquiet in Rosslare Harbour and further afield in County Wexford. There seems to be an inordinate delay in finalising the Department's intention for this facility. As the Minister will appreciate, in the interregnum, rumours of all kinds have grown legs in the local community. After holding silence on it for a very long time, I have raised this matter to hear directly from the Minister what will now be done. Is my understanding of the position which I have put before the House accurate? What is the intention of the Minister and his Department for the Devereaux Hotel? The people of Wexford deserve no less than a clear and comprehensive response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this matter. The number of asylum seekers entering this country has increased dramatically in recent years. The current rate of arrival is in excess of 1,000 per month and, on the basis of recent trends, it is anticipated that up to 12,000 applications for asylum will be made this year. The significant increase in persons applying for refugee status has resulted in an acute shortage of accommodation in the greater Dublin area. At this time, the supply of accommodation in the greater Dublin area has been virtually exhausted. Apart altogether from the shortage of accommodation in Dublin, it is not desirable from an integration point of view to have all asylum seekers located in the capital.</P>
      <P>In line with overall Government policy and allied to the lack of accommodation in the Dublin area, it is necessary to source suitable accommodation throughout the country on an ongoing basis. The alternative, where asylum seekers would have to resort to sleeping on the street and in parks, is simply unacceptable. In the longer term, my aim and that of the Government is to achieve a fair and balanced distribution of asylum seekers throughout the country. In the meantime, all suitable offers of accommodation are considered and, where practical and feasible, are brought into use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> Currently about 3,000 asylum seekers are accommodated in 59 centres throughout the State by means of the system of direct provision. This system, which was decided upon by the Government after careful consideration of all the issues involved, meets the basic accommodation and food needs of asylum seekers and has been in place since April. No asylum seekers are accommodated under this system in County Wexford. In keeping with overall public policy, which is focused towards achieving a more even and balanced distribution of asylum seekers throughout the country, the strong likelihood is that asylum seekers will, in due course, be accommodated in the Wexford area.</P>
    <P>The Devereaux Hotel was purchased by the Office of Public Works in late spring of this year <Col N="344" /> for use by the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, the agency established by the Government for the purpose of, <i>inter alia</i>, implementing the system of direct provision. As such, the hotel is now part of the State's property portfolio. Due to local opposition, it has not, to date, been possible to bring it into use as an accommodation or assessment-reception centre for persons arriving in Rosslare and seeking asylum.</P>
    <P>However, discussions with local representatives are continuing with a view to ensuring this facility can be used by the directorate as part of its overall strategy for meeting the reception needs of asylum seekers in the south-east region. I anticipate that these discussions will conclude shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 November 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 599 together.</P>
      <P>Information on the overall cost of the influenza immunisation programme is not available as the campaign is still in progress. Fees payable to general practitioners for influenza immunisation, at a rate of £21.94 per medical card patient, represent a major element of the cost of this campaign and claims in this regard are being received and processed at present.</P>
      <P>The cost of the vaccine stocks purchased by the health boards is estimated at £1.1 million. The campaign to promote uptake of influenza vaccination was arranged by the office for health gain on behalf of the health boards. The office for health gain has indicated that the overall cost of promotional activities was £320,000. In addition to the cost of advertisements in the national and provincial press and on local and national radio, this figure includes the cost of production and printing of promotional material such as posters and leaflets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board that it has already fully considered the report published in the British Medical Journal &ndash; 2 September 2000 &ndash; and that it is satisfied that the new information about the effectivenesss of St. John's Wort as an anti-depressant reinforces the recommendation of the board that medicinal products for the treatment of depression should be subject to prescription only control. The article <Col N="346" /> does not suggest that medicinal products containing St. John's Wort should be available over the counter.</P>
      <P>While the article reports that St. John's Wort has a low incidence of side effects, it has been pointed out that the particular study was conducted in a limited number of carefully selected patients, as is usual for all clinical trials. However, caution is expressed by the board that with general use the incidence of side effects may be higher, in particular because of the known potential of St. John's Wort to interact with a wide variety of commonly used medicines.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the expert scientific body in this country in regard to the circumstances under which medicinal products may be placed on the market or supplied to the public. The board has advised my Department that the additional information provided by the British Medical Journal article does not provide any grounds for altering its original recommendation to confine medicinal products containing St. John's Wort to prescription only control, made with a view to protecting public health and ensuring their safe and appropriate use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The burial of the remains of suspect animals was carried out under licence from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and under the direct supervision of Department personnel and subject to certain safety requirements to minimise any risk to public health. These safety requirements include the site being at least ten feet deep and suitable to avoid contamination of ground water and water courses. Monitoring of the quality of public water supplies for possible contamination from whatever source is a function of the local authorities. We are advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development that the carcasses of suspect animals were disinfected before burial and the burial pit was lined and treated with quicklime to accelerate decomposition.</P>
      <P>I believe that from a public health perspective the burial of BSE suspect animals is not the most preferable method of disposal. However, as has been made clear by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, that method was used only because there was no suitable alternative means of disposal readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has stated that burials will cease <Col N="347" /> and interim arrangements are being put in place involving retention of the carcasses of suspect animals in cold storage pending a more lasting solution. Incineration appears to be the preferred solution and the BSE sub-committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has called for the provision of effective incineration facilities for suspect carcasses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 178, 188, 409, 444, 462 and 497 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify the situation in relation to the provision of services generally and personal assistance services in particular.</P>
      <P>The provision of health related services to people with physical and sensory disabilities is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. All additional funding made available for the development of such services is provided to the authority and the health boards to allocate on a priority basis, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers, including CILs and consumers of service, are represented on these co-ordinating, committees.</P>
      <P>The personal assistant provides assistance at the discretion and direction of a person with a disability, who is called a leader, with everyday tasks, such as personal care and household tasks, which the person is unable to do for him or herself. A full personal assistance service has been defined by the Centre for Independent Living as a need for at least 20 hours service per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently two types of personal <Col N="349" /> assistance service being provided, one by the Irish Wheelchair Association in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the other by the Centres for Independent Living throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association/Eastern Regional Health Authority personal assistance service was started by CIL as INCARE, an EU funded pilot project, which was taken over by the Irish Wheelchair Association in October 1995. The IWA and health board personnel are involved in the interviewing and assessment of individuals requesting a personal assistance service. Of the applications received by the IWA for assisted living services, approximately 80% are identified as having their service needs most appropriately met by forms of home support other than the personal assistant service. The IWA currently provides a service to 53 individuals, employing some 90 personal assistants working a 35 hour week at cost of £1.2 million per annum &ndash; an average cost of over £22,000 per annum for each leader or recipient of service.</P>
    <P>The Centres for Independent Living provide personal assistance services mainly through the FÁS community employment scheme, with the trainees acting as personal assistants. The FÁS funding also enables the centre to pay an administrator, a leader co-ordinator and a research officer. CILs also access health board funding for the provision and development of their services and are represented on the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. CILs currently provide a service to 308 &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>A joint CIL/Rehab. Group company, Independent Living Community Services &ndash; ILCS &ndash; was set up to administer these schemes. With effect from 1998, ILCS has been receiving an annual grant of £100,000 from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the provision of its services. This is in addition to the Centre for Independent Living in Dublin, which was the original centre and had on overall umbrella role in the past. The CIL in Dublin receives a grant of £50,000 per annum from the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A new organisation, the Independent Living Network &ndash; ILN &ndash; has recently been set up to act as an umbrella organisation for all 26 branches of CIL throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Part of an ongoing campaign conducted by the Centres for Independent Living in the past and now being conducted by its new umbrella organisation, the Independent Living Network, is that the personal assistant service be funded by an independent living fund. Basically, this means that some agency would be given a sum of money to administer, paying it to individual people with disabilities to hire personal assistants. In its recent pre-budget submission, the ILN have based its proposal on an expansion of services, to 750 leaders, at a total cost of £10,804,594 per annum &ndash; an average of £14,330 per annum per leader. This estimate of cost would also cover the existing <Col N="350" /> service being provided by the CILs using the FÁS community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>Various reports in relation to disability recommend that a PA service be funded in the medium-long term by way of a cost of disability payment, paid by Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or by a Department of health and social services, but by the Department of Health and Children, through the health boards, in the short term. Officials from my Department have recently met the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to discuss the mainstreaming of the community employment essential services, including the mainstreaming of the 253 individuals providing supervisor and personal assistance services under the FÁS community employment scheme to the Centres for Independent Living.</P>
    <P>The independent living fund is no more than a particular model for funding a personal assistance service. The important thing is that the service itself be provided to those needing it. The personal assistance service is one of a range of support services designed to enable people with disabilities to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual. The range includes home helps, home care attendants, respite care, day care etc.. The provision of a service is most appropriately based on the individual's needs, which may not always be best met by a personal assistance service. The objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the amount of funding allocated for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and having particular regard to the desirability of taking an equitable approach in addressing the needs of all people with disability who require various levels of support. The amount allocated by an individual health board in any year is decided in the context of local needs and in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. It is my view that this approach should continue rather than establishing a separate independent living fund.</P>
    <P>A properly structured PA service needs to have a formal assessment procedure to assess the level of dependency of the individual with a disability and the suitability of the person to manage a PA. This might be done by the health boards as part of a structure for assessing the precise service needs of each individual with a physical or sensory disability, with perhaps a further assessment carried out jointly with the agency providing the PA service to the health board. It is envisaged that the health boards would broker the service, contracting with one or more service providers in each board's area. The service provider would hire, train and pay the PA, as the IWA does at present for the ERHA.</P>
    <P>Expansion of PA services for personal social services must be funded out of moneys allocated for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This year £3 <Col N="351" /> million, with a full year cost of £6 million in 2001, has been allocated to health boards to develop home support services, including personal assistance services.</P>

      <P>While specific additional support services for persons with autism have been developed in recent years, this population group has also benefited from the overall significant enhancement of services to persons with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>In particular, additional funding amounting to approximately £5 million has been invested between 1998 and this year in the enhancement of health related support services for children with autism. This includes early intervention and pre-school and out reach services for school children. These services are provided by multi-disciplinary support teams, which work closely with the parents and families of children with autism and the teaching staff to address their needs. My Department, together with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, will continue to work with the Department of Education and Science to further enhance the services available to these children.</P>
      <P>There is also a need, as part of the overall planning for and development of services, to continue to enhance the information available to my Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in relation to both the numbers of persons with autism and the services they require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 196, 424 and 601 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was formally launched on 10 October last. Phase I of the programme will cover the eastern, north eastern and midland health board areas and will target 136,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population. The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion unit. In addition, the first mobile screening commenced on 21 August 2000 in Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the <Col N="353" /> screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. For this reason the national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>A review of symptomatic breast cancer services was carried out by a sub group of the national cancer forum at the request of my predecessor, Deputy Cowen. This review commenced in 1999 and I received the report of the review in April this year.</P>
    <P>Having considered the report entitled Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. This report is essentially about the development of centres of excellence for the specialist treatment of breast disease. The report refers to the strong evidence which exists that women with breast cancer are at a lower risk of relapse and have a better opportunity of long-term survival if they are treated in a multidisciplinary setting. This means that surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, medical oncologists, radiotherapists, plastic surgeons, nurses, counsellors and others all bring expertise together to provide the best care for each patient. The report is recommending the establishment of these specialist units. In this context I emphasise the importance of prioritising women's health over and above geopolitical considerations.</P>
    <P>Having considered the report, I established an expert advisory group to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating the health boards implementation plans for the development of specialist breast units. This advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins has met all health boards recently. The health boards are now formulating their plans for the development of the services in their own regions and I await the submission of these plans.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the accident and emergency facilities at the hospital concerned now rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approval has been sought from my Depart<Col N="354" /> ment for the development of a new acute assessment unit and a major upgrading of the emergency department facilities at the hospital and I have recently announced support for this.</P>
    <P>This new unit will be located adjacent to the hospital's accident and emergency department and will provide for speedier consultant interaction and improved services for patients. It is anticipated that this will reduce the number of investigations as earlier intervention and diagnosis to a more senior appropriate clinical level will result in a shorter average length of stay for patients and more efficient use of hospital beds.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware I recently announced the allocation of an additional £25 million as part of a winter initiative, designed to reduce the pressures on acute hospitals over the winter period. This funding will enable specific initiatives to be taken including initiatives in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>For patients who require admission to hospital, the shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough to cater for new patients requiring admission to the hospital, particularly those in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Additional step-down beds will be available to the hospital this year. As part of the winter initiative the ERHA will have access to an additional 495 beds by the end of March 2001.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has identified accident and emergency services as a priority and a report on accident and emergency services was submitted to the board of the authority recently. This report forms the basis for the terms of reference for a review of accident and emergency services in the region. The objective of this review is to examine in detail the existing accident and emergency services and to bring forward a comprehensive policy which will improve access and reduce waiting times for treatment and admission. I understand that an interim report of the review group is due to be presented to the board of the authority in the near future.</P>

      <P>The young person concerned was on remand in a Department of Education and Science centre as she was facing criminal charges. Due to her behaviour, the centre was unable to keep her in care and the health board in whose functional area she lives took over the case. Initially, the health board did not have a suitable location in which to place the child and it was necessary to place her in a psychiatric hospital as a short-term measure pending the establishment of a specialised unit.</P>
      <P>Funding for this purpose was made available to the health board as follows: capital funding of approximately £250,000 was made available to the board to convert a property already in the ownership of the board so that it would be suitable for use as a specialised unit &ndash; details of the final costs are not yet to hand; and £700,000 was made available to cover the full-year cost of operating the unit which will eventually house three troubled children and also to provide a dedicated psychology and counselling service which residents of the unit will have first call on, though the service may also be available to other troubled children in the board's functional area.</P>
      <P>The delay in providing the service was due to the necessity to carry out the conversion work which was completed to allow the new unit to open as scheduled on 23 August last.</P>

    </P>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): There are difficulties in the orthodontic service due to a variety of factors, a number of which are not within the control of my Department. These difficulties are being addressed and progress is being made on a number of fronts.</P>
    <P>The dental health action plan which was launched in 1994 provides for the development by each health board of a consultant led orthodontic service. Most health boards now have a consultant service in place and services continue to be developed in accordance with the action plan.</P>
    <P>However, the service targets currently being achieved fall somewhat short of the targets set under the action plan.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the orthodontic services carried out by health boards in 1998 &ndash; the Moran report &ndash; structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. A grade of specialist in orthodontics will be introduced following completion of negotiations under the Health Service Employers Agency. Efforts are being made to progress with the relevant authorities the putting in place of training programmes for dentists working in the regional units to allow them to reach specialist level. My Department has approached the Dental Council concerning the recognition of a new grade of auxiliary dental worker in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>I hope that these structural changes, when fully on stream, will allow target service levels to be achieved.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I have been considering in the context of the Estimates for 2001 a special initiative on the orthodontic waiting lists. On the assumption that sufficient funding can be made available, the main features of this initiative would be recruitment of additional dental teams; additional sessions for existing dental teams; and additional contractual arrangements with private orthodontists at approved rates.</P>
    <P>The current guidelines for the provision of orthodontic treatment were issued by my Department in 1985. I propose to reissue these guidelines shortly to health boards. Category A and category B will be substantially the same as in the 1985 guidelines but category B will be extended, to include an aesthetic component.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The background to the case is as follows. The woman concerned tested positive for hepatitis C in October 1997. However, a serious dispute emerged in this case between the woman and the Western Health Board regarding the source of her hepatitis C infection. The woman herself believes that the source was infected anti-D and is of the strong view that anti-D was administered to her following the birth of her child in Castlebar Hospital in March 1993. She alleges that a medical record was later altered to denote that anti-D was not administered. The board stated that their medical records show that anti-D was not administered to the woman while she was under their care in March 1993.</P>
      <P>Tests carried out by the independent laboratory jointly run by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the department of medical microbiology, University of Edinburgh, indicated that the source of the woman's hepatitis C infection was not the anti-D product manufactured by the BTSB. The laboratory's findings are disputed by the woman.</P>
      <P>The board arranged for the woman's solicitors to gain access to all the hospital records relating to the case, including medical, nursing and laboratory records in their original format. I understand that the solicitors also met members of the hospital staff, including medical, nursing, laboratory staff and management, who explained the hospital's practices, procedures and record keeping arrangements in relation to the administration of anti-D. The hospital subsequently forwarded copies of any documentation requested by the solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The woman's family requested the Garda to investigate whether anti-D was administered to the woman in Castlebar Hospital and whether her hospital records had been materially altered. The Garda visited the hospital on 28 October and 16 November 1998 in relation to this investigation and, at the request of the hospital, took a number of records away for <Col N="358" /> forensic examination. I have been informed by the Western Health Board that the Garda authorities have had no further contact with it in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the woman's desire for a decision on the causation of her hepatitis C, my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, indicated on numerous occasions that he considered that the hepatitis C compensation tribunal was the most appropriate forum in which to have this matter resolved.</P>
    <P>The tribunal was established by the Oireachtas and has a statutory remit to determine causation on the balance of probabilities. In addition, the tribunal has the confidence of all four of the support groups representing persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration within the State of infected blood and blood products. Indeed, approximately 1,400 individuals have had their claims determined by the tribunal to date. On 30 June 1998, an offer was made to the woman concerned to arrange an early hearing on the causation issue alone, independent of considerations of compensation. In addition, as the woman is now living abroad, my Department offered as an exceptional measure to arrange financial assistance for herself and her family to facilitate their attendance at the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the woman's legal representatives informed my Department that their client would be attending the hepatitis C compensation tribunal and the necessary arrangements were made by my Department to cover the expenses which she would incur in attending the tribunal. As the hepatitis C compensation tribunal is independent in its operation of both myself and my Department, I am not in a position to confirm the outcome of the hearing. I understand from media reports, however, that the woman's case was withdrawn from the compensation tribunal before any determination had been made. If this is the case, I urge her to return to the tribunal so that a resolution of this matter can be achieved as quickly as possible. I should point out that a decision of the hepatitis C compensation tribunal in relation to causation would in no way debar the woman from proceeding to the High Court at a later stage if she should choose to do so. Claimants are only required to discontinue legal proceedings if they choose to accept the compensation tribunal's award.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, requires nursing homes to be registered with their local health board. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care, facilities for recreation and other arrangements to ensure the health and well-being of residents. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years. A health board may impose conditions in relation to registration, including a ceiling on the number of persons who may be accommodated in a home. The regulations provide for periodic inspections by the health boards, which are empowered to prosecute registered proprietors and persons in charge in the event of breaches of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Gender mixing occurs in high dependency units such as intensive care, coronary care and accident and emergency departments as well as in small geriatric assessment units. Outside these areas, gender mixing may occur as a result of emergency medical need where no alternative accommodation can be found at the time of admission. Therefore, it may not be possible to reorganise the accommodation arrangements for male and female patients on a day to day basis to correspond with the varied demand for male and female beds as some flexibility is occasionally required in order to ensure patient admission. In such circumstances patients are usually mixed only for short periods until alternative accommodation can be found. On such occasions it would be normal practice that patients would be screened off by the use of curtains, etc. to ensure that a degree of privacy can be maintained.</P>

The system was installed initially at the Coombe Hospital in early 1999 and was subsequently installed in the National Maternity and Rotunda Hospitals in late 1999. I understand from the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the system has been operating satisfactorily since its introduction. I point out that the system was introduced to supplement or improve the hospitals' existing security arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 213 and 635 together.</P>
      <P>First, a nationwide survey of nursing vacancies existing at 30 September 2000 is currently being undertaken by the Health Service Employers Agency on behalf of my Department. When this survey has been completed, I will transmit the results to Deputies Currie, McDowell and Durkan. However, at this stage I can confirm that the total number of nursing vacancies in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area is 1,137. This deficit is mitigated by the employment of 366 whole-time equivalent agency nurses. The impact of the shortage is further mitigated by overtime working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major Dublin acute hospitals account for 41% of the vacancies in the eastern region. <Col N="362" /> However, these hospitals have engaged in a successful international recruitment drive. The Mater Hospital, for example, has dramatically improved its situation over the last year. In addition to overseas recruitment, new graduates from the nursing diploma programmes will be coming on stream in the next few months. It is anticipated therefore that the overall position will have improved significantly by the end of this year.  </P>
    <P>Nationally, action is being taken across a number of fronts to try to improve the situation in terms of recruitment and retention. A number of these have already been referred to in this House and are summarised as follows: funding of £10 million to implement priority action plan for implementation of the Commission on Nursing report; new arrangements for better starting pay, standardised overtime working arrangements and a significantly improved regime of allowances; significant improvement in promotional structure within nursing since publication of the report of the Commission on Nursing and nurses' pay settlement; and up to 1,250 clinical nurse-midwife specialist positions are being introduced and refund of fees initiative for part-time degree courses, as well as midwifery and public health nurse training.</P>
    <P>Increasing the annual intakes of nursing students is a key element of the overall strategy for addressing the current shortage of nurses. Under an agreement between the Department and the Nursing Alliance, an additional 300 training places were provided this year, bringing to 1,500 the total number of training places available. The intention is that this level of intake will be maintained in 2001 and 2002.</P>
    <P>Some 1,500 new nursing students commenced training this month at various centres around the country, 1,000 in general nursing, 200 in mental handicap nursing and 300 in psychiatric nursing. This represents a 25% increase over last year's intake of 1,200 students, which in itself was the highest for several years. Record numbers of students have entered both psychiatric and mental handicap nurse training this year. Due to the high level of acceptances by successful applicants, some centres are oversubscribed.</P>
    <P>There are currently 3,720 nursing students at various stages of training and we are on target to have 4,500 students in training by 2002.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Durkan's question, the Department is also engaged in strategic planning through the study of the nursing and midwifery resource. The focus of this work is on longer term planning. The primary objective of the study is to forecast as far as possible future nursing and midwifery workforce needs. I have received an interim report and this has been circulated widely within the health services. I am considering the recommendations of this report and I will soon announce further initiatives aimed at improving recruitment and retention.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy McDowell's question regarding an additional payment for nurses in the <Col N="363" /> Dublin area, I should explain that the only forum in which nurses' pay rates, including all allowances, can be dealt with is the benchmarking body established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The position regarding care assistants is as I told Deputy McManus in reply to a question from her on 25 October. In accordance with a recommendation of the Commission on Nursing, a working group on the effective use of the professional skills of nurses and midwives has been established. This working group comprises representatives of my Department, health service employers and nursing unions. Part of its remit involves examining opportunities for the increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing personnel in the performance of non-nursing tasks. The working group held its first meeting in May and is proceeding with its deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>My Department commissioned the ESRI to carry out a research study on private practice in public hospitals in May 1998. On 19 October last, the ESRI published its report, Private Practice in Irish Public Hospitals by Dr. Brian Nolan and Miriam Wiley. The report assesses the extent of private practice within the public hospital sector, the characteristics of the case-mix being dealt with, and the costs associated with provision of that care. The report also considers the adequacy of the arrangements currently in place regarding equity of access for public patients, which involve, <i>inter alia, </i>the designation of beds as private <i>versus</i> public and the monitoring of their use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the early 1990s, most beds in public hospitals have been designated as for public or private use. About 20% of in-patient beds in acute public hospitals are currently designated as being for private patient use. The report shows that, of the total number of public bed days used, approximately 6% were used by private patients and that about 23% of all in-patient bed-days spent by private patients in public hospitals were in beds designated as public. In addition, the report also shows that there is a crossover of slightly lower absolute volume in the other direc<Col N="364" /> tion, that is of public patients into private beds. The authors suggest that improvements to the reporting and monitoring of the arrangements could be piloted in hospitals where crossover is most prevalent. The report states that the main factor identified by hospital management as leading to private patients being accommodated in public beds was admission through accident and emergency departments. This largely reflects the need to accommodate patients in the most appropriate available bed, irrespective of its designation. Nonetheless, the study shows that the throughput of patients is consistent with public-private bed designations. The public private mix in public hospitals is under continual assessment by my Department to ensure that the best possible service is available to all patients, but particularly the public patient. This assessment includes monitoring of the bed designation system whereby the approval of the Minister for Health and Children must be obtained by public agencies for any increase in the designation.</P>
    <P>In examining the extent and cost of providing private care in public hospitals, the study found that the cost of provision of private care in public hospitals substantially exceeds the current level of charges for such care. About one quarter of the direct cost of providing in-patient care in public hospitals was attributable to private patients, accounting for about £130 million in 1996. This was about twice the income from charges for private accommodation. As indicated in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance, the Government is committed to moving towards the full economic costing of private beds in public hospitals. The progression towards more economic pricing will be determined in a way which is sensitive to maintaining stability in the market for private health insurance.</P>
    <P>The report finds that there are pressures on the system as a whole and indicates that changes in the structure of incentives facing hospitals, consultants and insurers could significantly alter the nature of the regulation required to promote equity of access. This Government has recognised these pressures and is addressing them on a number of fronts. In particular, I have initiated a study of bed capacity in response to commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This study is examining both acute and non-acute beds numbers and will deal with issues relating to bed numbers throughout the public system.</P>

      <P>In July, 2000 the group charged with implementing the recommendations of the report Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures <Col N="365" /> presented me with a report on progress on implementation at national level and in each of the health boards. I am making a copy of this report available to the Deputy. I bring to the Deputy's attention chapter 6 of the report which highlights that the duration of assessment has already been reduced.</P>
      <P>Statistics collected from the health boards at the end of September 2000 indicate that the projected waiting times in some of the boards with the longest waiting times have been reduced in the interim. This is as a result of initiatives taken by the boards in relation to the recruitment of additional social work staff and the efficiencies arising from the introduction of the standardised framework for intercountry adoption assessment. In particular, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, whose service for the three area boards is provided by the South West Area Health Board, has reduced from 36-42 months projected waiting time in June 2000 to 24-36 months in September 2000. In the Mid-Western Health Board area the projected waiting time for assessment has reduced from 30 months in June 2000 to 18-20 months in September 2000. In addition, the overall waiting list has reduced from 1056 at the end of June to 1002 at the end of September. While this data has not been adjusted to reflect any seasonal variations in the number of applications they seem to indicate that the waiting lists are being shortened and that the excessive waiting times being experienced by applicants in some boards are being reduced. I am satisfied that the initiatives already taken have brought about improvements and that this trend will continue.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the steps being taken to ensure that the national breast cancer screening service is available to all women on a country wide basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24539/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 136,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. For this reason the national breast screening programme must be driven by <Col N="366" /> international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
    <P>Specifically the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles Unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion unit. In addition, the first mobile screening commenced on 21 August 2000 in Longford.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. A review of symptomatic breast cancer services was carried out by a sub-group of the national cancer forum at the request of my predecessor, Deputy Cowen. This review commenced in 1999 and I received its report in April this year.</P>
    <P>Having considered the report entitled Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. This report is essentially about the development of centres of excellence for the specialist treatment of breast disease. The report refers to the strong evidence which exists that women with breast cancer are at a lower risk of relapse and have a better opportunity of long-term survival if they are treated in a multidisciplinary setting. This means that surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, medical oncologists, radiotherapists, plastic surgeons, nurses, counsellors and others all bring expertise together to provide the best care for each patient. The report is recommending the establishment of these specialist units. It is in this context that I emphasise the importance of prioritising women's health over and above geopolitical considerations.</P>
    <P>Having considered the report, I established an expert advisory group to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating the health boards implementation plans for the development of specialist breast units. This advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins has met with all health boards recently. The health boards are now formulating their plans for <Col N="367" /> the development of the services in their own regions and I await the submission of these plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties in the orthodontic services. There has been considerable investment over the past few years under the dental health action plan in the setting up by the health boards of orthodontic services. All boards, with the exception of the Midland Health Board, have a consultant-led service in place. The Midland Health Board currently provides orthodontic services by arrangements with private orthodontists and hopes to be successful in recruiting a consultant from a recent competition.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to develop the orthodontic services in accordance with the dental health action plan. This year I have made an additional £1.45 million available to the health boards on an ongoing basis for the further development of their orthodontic services. Despite these developments in the service waiting times for treatment are in some instances unacceptably high.</P>
      <P>At my invitation, the health boards recently submitted proposals to me as to how waiting lists and waiting times for orthodontic treatment in their areas might be further reduced. I am considering these proposals in the context of the Estimates for 2001.</P>
      <P>The report of a review of the orthodontic services &ndash; The Moran report &ndash; made to the chief executive officers made recommendations for the development of the services. My Department has now issued a comprehensive response to the various recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report, in conjunction with my Department's response, provides an agreed framework for progressing various issues in relation to the orthodontic services. In particular there is agreement on the recommendation that specialist orthodontists appropriately trained, qualified and registered be employed in the orthodontic services. The Dental Council has agreed to set up a specialist register. This issue is now being advanced with the staff association at the Health Service Employers Agency. The creation of the <Col N="368" /> grade of specialist orthodontist will considerably enhance the service provision and help to retain trained staff in the services by providing them with a suitable career structure.</P>
    <P>I am advised that patients awaiting orthodontic treatment for long periods do not suffer pain and do not incur permanent damage or ill effects. A percentage of cases requiring orthodontic treatment also require oral surgery. These cases are priority cases and receive early attention.</P>

      <P>The medical staffing of public hospitals is being considered by the medical manpower forum at present. The forum is due to finalise its first report shortly. One of the key principles of the forum is to ensure that the highest quality of medical care is provided for those who require the services of hospitals. This will require an increase in the current number of hospital consultant posts and a number of other linked changes. Following completion of the forum's first report, it is proposed that the next steps should be an assessment of the effect of the changes recommended in a representative number of hospitals. This assessment will take into account the changes in medical staffing required to give effect to the recommendations of the forum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the inspector of mental hospitals for the year ending 31 December 1999 acknowledged the progress that has been made in the provision of acute units in general hospitals, community mental health centres, day hospitals and community residential facilities. However, there was also a reference to the need for progress to accelerate. In this connection, I assure the Deputy that I intend to facilitate further significant development of the services under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>A sum of £150 million capital is being made available under the NDP for the development of mental health services. A significant part of this funding will go towards general hospitals as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. At the end of the period of the national development plan, it is the intention to have the programme of acute psychiatric units completed, which will mean an end to acute admissions to the old psychiatric hospitals. The plan will also provide for more community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences which will further accelerate the phasing out of the old institutions.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed in the inspector's report at difficulties recruiting qualified psychiatric nursing personnel, which were particularly acute in the eastern region. Increasing the annual intake of psychiatric nurses is a key element in the Government's strategy for addressing the current shortage of nurses. In excess of £1 million has been provided for local and national marketing campaigns undertaken by the nursing careers centre and the schools of nursing around the country. The schools of nursing have since succeeded in filling a record 254 training places in psychiatric nursing in 1999 and this record figure was exceeded this year, rising to 300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his report the inspector also expressed concern at the lack of multidisciplinary teams in many mental health services, particularly in the area of psychology and social work services. Additional resources of £1.4 million were provided to health boards in 2000 for improvements in these services. The inspector also highlighted a <Col N="370" /> number of other service and quality of care issues which were raised with individual service providers. These issues will continue to be pursued with a view to bringing about the improvements required.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to facilitate the health boards in so far as possible in bringing about the improvements and developments identified by the inspector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140, 166, 441 and 482 together.</P>
      <P>Annual immunisation against influenza is recommended for persons over 65 years of age and for other persons with certain conditions, such as chronic respiratory or heart disease. Advice was received this year from the national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland that health care workers who have direct patient contact in health care institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes etc., should also receive the influenza vaccine. In the light of these recommendations my Department asked the health boards to promote the annual immunisation against influenza of health care workers in health board and non-health board settings, that is, hospitals, nursing homes and, where considered appropriate, in the community.</P>
      <P>A stock of influenza vaccine is purchased each year by the health boards for use in immunising persons in the designated at-risk groups. This year, in order to ensure that vaccine was available to meet anticipated demand, the quantity of influenza vaccine ordered was increased by one third over that purchased in 1999 to 435,000 doses when contingency stocks are taken into account. Delivery of the majority of this stock took place in September 2000 and arrangements were made by health boards to distribute this to doctors.</P>
      <P>There has been a very good response to this year's immunisation campaign. This success has meant that the rate of usage of influenza vaccine has been significantly higher than in previous years. In some areas of the country there was an interval between the initial stock of vaccine being used and delivery of the second batch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining quantity of vaccine on order was delivered on 31 October and is being distributed to health boards for use. In the light of the <Col N="372" /> high level of demand experienced this year, a further 20,000 doses of influenza vaccine have been ordered and will be available towards the end of this month.</P>
    <P>In relation to meningococcal C vaccine, I have been informed by the health boards and the vaccine suppliers that there is no supply difficulty with this product. I understand that at the commencement of the programme there were slight delays in the supply of vaccine to general practitioners in a small number of cases. Arrangements are in place to enable general practitioners to obtain the stocks of this vaccine they require through their regional health board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141, 426, 458 and 460 together.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking asylum seekers throughout the country have been accommodated within the GMS without any appreciable difficulty, except in a small number of localised instances. This has been due to a significant degree to the positive approach of general practitioners and the consultative stance adopted by health boards in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the localised areas of difficulty is in Kerry and I am informed by the Southern Health Board that the position there is as follows. At present, there are in excess of 400 asylum seekers located in five towns throughout County Kerry. <Col N="373" /> The majority of these asylum seekers have been assigned to individual general practitioners who are providing primary health care services. The board is experiencing some difficulties in certain locations where general practitioners have refused to accept additional asylum seekers on their panels. As a result, the board has entered into detailed negotiations with these general practitioners and the Irish Medical Organisation. The board is currently finalising revised arrangements for the provision of primary care services to asylum seekers through general practitioners and it is expected that these revised procedures will enable a full primary care service to be delivered to these persons.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the above, I have no proposals in regard to introducing national initiatives under the GMS in this area, nor have I received any specific national proposals from the Irish Medical Organisation on this matter. However, in the context of the ongoing discussions that take place between that organisation and my Department, it has been identified by it as a subject that it would like to raise for discussion at the next meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being encountered <Col N="374" /> by hospitals delivering accident and emergency services and in particular the problem of overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>I am advised that patient numbers attending the Mid-Western Regional Hospital have increased by 24.63% during the past ten years with a total of over 55,000 attending during 1999. The management of the board has been reviewing the operation of the accident and emergency department for the past number of months and a number of initiatives have already commenced including more direct access to some services for example, routine X-rays.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that a new information technology system is now partly operational and supports the patient triage system which is undertaken by a trained nurse within 15 minutes of a patient's arrival. The initial data on patient management indicates that approximately 50% of those attending the accident and emergency department present with a non-serious illness or injury which is treatable elsewhere. A significant number of patients in this category present without visiting a general practitioner beforehand.</P>
      <P>The board is striving to ensure that treatment at the accident and emergency department is provided to patients who require to be treated in such departments and that those with less serious injury or illness are seen by a general practitioner in the first instance or are referred to an appropriate service following triage if the presenting illness or injury is not serious.</P>
      <P>In 1998, 1999 and 2000 the Department approved an additional funding of £2,250,000, £2,000,000 and £2,000,000 respectively to meet the costs of implementing initiatives aimed at improving access to accident and emergency services. First, there is the continuing need for public education regarding the appropriateness of attending the accident and emergency department. Second, the advent of extra long-stay places should provide some relief in regard to beds in acute hospitals. Of the £2,000,000 allocated in 2000, the Mid-Western Health Board received funding of £150,000.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced the allocation of an additional £25 million as part of a winter initiative designed to reduce the pressures on acute hospitals over the winter period. This funding will enable specific initiatives to be taken including initiatives in accident and emergency departments. As part of this initiative, the Mid-Western Health Board will have access to 35 private nursing home beds for six months from October 2000 to March 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subvention to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by the Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's priority this year is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands on the scheme. I am keeping under review the scope that exists for effecting further improvements in the scheme. The question of increasing rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that the problem of youth homelessness is most acute in the Dublin area. Youth homelessness is also a significant issue in Cork and Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, when homeless children and young people come to the attention of a health board every effort is made to reunite them with their family or have them placed in foster or residential care as appropriate. Social work support, advice, information, financial support and counselling and mediation for families and individuals is offered. Since this Government came to office in 1997 an additional allocation of approximately £60 million revenue on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of child care <Col N="377" /> and family support services including youth homelessness services.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority, which is the statutory body with responsibility for health and social services for people who live in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, has identified young people who are out of home as one of the key issues it has to tackle.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the area boards in the eastern region have made significant progress in implementing the comprehensive package of child care and youth homeless service developments agreed with the Minister for Health and Children last July. This includes (1) the establishment of a provider forum on youth homelessness which brings together key service providers in the youth homelessness field; (2) the appointment of a director of homelessness to the Authority who will be working in the provider forum to develop a calendar plan to urgently address the needs of young people in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way; (3) the recruitment of a significant number of additional project workers, family support workers and out-reach workers, which is well advanced; (4) the appointment of an additional assistant chief executive officer to each area health board to lead the development process; and (5) each area board has carried out a review of existing facilities and properties have been sourced to provide additional hostel-residential care accommodation.</P>
    <P>Work on the national youth homeless strategy is progressing and I hope to launch it later this year.</P>

      <P>As part of the national cancer strategy a national cervical screening programme is being introduced on a phased basis. Phase I of the programme has just commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>Phase I involves 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group in the mid-western region. Under the programme, women in this age group will have a smear taken by their GP, family planning clinic or health board clinic, free of charge, at minimum intervals of five years. Substantial funding has been provided to develop and expand the laboratory and colposcopy services required under phase I to meet minimum standards and best practice guidelines set out in quality assurance guidelines for the national programme produced by the national expert advisory group on cervical screening. The quality assurance guidelines recommend that a cervical smear test should be processed by the cytology laboratory within four weeks of the date of receipt and that the waiting time for colposcopic assessment treatment following a moderately severely dyskaryotic smear should not exceed four weeks and that other waiting times should not exceed eight weeks.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the programme to the rest of the country is currently being examined. This will have resource implications in terms of ensuring that laboratory and colposcopy services meet the necessary requirements set out in the quality assurance guidelines for the national programme.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, one third of NCHDs working in Ireland have come from abroad, many of these from the Indian subcontinent. Indian and Pakistani doctors have been coming to Ireland for further training for 30 to 40 years. In recent times this pool of doctors has reduced considerably and accordingly a more proactive approach has been taken in order to restore the balance.</P>
      <P>The Irish delegation were impressed with the calibre of candidates. There was no hesitation in recommending some of the candidates for positions in Ireland provided that registration and visa regulations can be complied with.</P>
      <P>The delegation met the respective Society of Anaesthesiologists from both India and Pakistan. The Society of Anaesthesiologists in the two countries were very supportive of our endeavours on the basis that there were mutual benefits for all concerned. They would support the establishment of more formal links with Ireland, to encourage their doctors to attain higher medical training in Ireland and having achieved higher qualifications, to return home to their own countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 630, 631, 641 and 642 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the overall numbers on waiting lists as at 30 June 2000, our latest available figures, fell by 5,004 which is a reduction of 13.58% on the end of the December 1999 quarter. This welcome reduction is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists. I outline the detailed breakdown of the waiting list figures in the format collected by my Department as requested by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>The number of reported cataract operations was 3,267 in 1997, 4,852 in 1998 and 5,483 in 1999. The number of persons on waiting lists for cataract operations at 30 June 2000 was 2,769.</P>
      <P>The number of reported hip operations was 3,957 in 1997, 4,319 in 1998 and 4,530 in 1999. The number of persons on waiting lists for hip operations at 30 June 2000 was 1,033. The latest activity data for 2000 is not yet available.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards earlier this year, I announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable additional waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This brings the dedicated funding to waiting list procedures to £34 million this year.</P>
      <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> Proposals for the development of a dedicated air ambulance service fall to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. It is important to acknowledge that the development of emergency medical services encompass all areas of emergency care including the ambulance service, general practice and hospitals accident and emergency departments. The potential benefits of a dedicated air ambulance service must, therefore, be examined in the context of the improvements to emergency medical services generally and I am anxious to ensure the development of a consensus in an Irish context of the most appropriate role for air support in the provision of pre-hospital care and inter-hospital transfer. I have personally held initial discussions in this matter recently with interested parties and I propose to have further discussions in the near future. I am also seeking the views of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council. The matter is also being considered at official level in the context of North-South cross-Border co-operation on pre-hospital emergency care.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 119 of 12 October last. As set out in that reply, two reports were received from the South Western Area Health Board &ndash; the first on 25 August 2000 in response to an oral request made by a departmental official the previous day and the second on 1 September in response to a further request made on 28 August 2000. No reports are outstanding.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, against the background of this child's death, the High Court has initiated an inquiry into the circumstances under which she absconded from care and the efforts made to give effect to the court's order that the Garda, search for, detain and return her to the unit from which she absconded. In advance of this inquiry, copies of the reports provided by the South Western Area Health Board, together with a copy of a report received from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are being forwarded to the solicitors acting for the family and they will be available to the High Court when the matter comes before it on 5 December next.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I do not propose to comment on the content of these reports at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the health boards that the immunisation campaign to protect against group C meningococcal disease is progressing well. General practitioners are providing the vaccine to the under five age-group and health board teams are undertaking vaccination of 15 to 18 year olds in post-primary schools. Vaccination of third level students is also proceeding. There is no difficulty in relation to vaccine supply. While it is too early to establish the precise level of uptake being achieved, preliminary indications are that uptake is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the phasing of the programme is to ensure that resources are directed initially at those most vulnerable to infection, that is, babies and children aged 0-4 years and young people aged 15-18 years. In response to inquiries, the office for health gain obtained legal advice on how family doctors should deal with any cases where they were asked to vaccinate children outside the initial priority groups. The health boards were informed by the office for health gain of the advice received. This matter is an operational one for the office for health gain and the health boards in the first instance. I understand from the office for health gain that the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General <Col N="384" /> Practitioners have responded positively to the initiative taken in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report of the national social work qualifications board of July 2000 which provides baseline information on social work posts in Ireland, based on a survey of the position as of 1 September 1999. The survey found that there was not enough social workers to fill the anticipated number of new posts that will be created over the coming years, and that an increase in the number of graduates from professional social work courses will be required. Officials of my Department have been in discussions with the board over the past number of months with a view to planning how this deficit can be best addressed. A meeting will take place this month between officials of my Department and those in the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority to further progress the issue.</P>
      <P>I point out to the Deputy that the intake to the relevant courses in Trinity College, Dublin, and University College, Cork, was increased by 20 places in October 1995 and that this increased intake has been maintained each year since. A bachelor of social work was introduced by the National University of Ireland, Cork, University College, Cork, with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year, with an intake of 18 students.</P>
      <P>The national social work qualifications board report outlines how any increase in training places is intrinsically linked to practice placement opportunities. Officials of my Department are undertaking an audit of all health service employers with a view to ascertaining the potential among employers to increase the number of practice placement places and the resource implications of such an increase. It is hoped that the results of this audit will be available this month.</P>
      <P>The national social work qualifications Board is investigating the potential for increasing the number of placement places in other sectors, that is, local authority and probation services. It is also in discussions with the relevant training colleges with a view to identifying how the practice placement structure can be improved upon.</P>

      <P>As part of the initial reception process for asylum seekers, communicable disease screening is offered on a voluntary basis to such persons during their stay at reception centres in Dublin. This service is offered in the interests of the asylum seekers themselves, their families and the community generally. The uptake for the service is approximately 75% and efforts continue to achieve further improvement in uptake. The health boards in other parts of the country have also been asked to ensure that screening is offered to asylum seekers accommodated in their area and who have not availed of screening during their stay in Dublin.</P>
      <P>In order to have the appropriate information and advice available to inform policy in relation to screening, my Department recently sought expert advice on the legal, ethical and public health issues involved. However, the Government has no plans to make communicable disease screening of asylum seekers compulsory.</P>

      <P>In regard to a simplified licensing scheme for <Col N="386" /> traditional and alternative medicinal products, including herbal medicinal products, I have asked the Irish Medicines Board to report back to me on the nature of a scheme which might be introduced in this country in respect of such products. My Department sanctioned the appointment of a herbal medicines project manager by the Irish Medicines Board to facilitate a review of the arrangements to be put in place for the introduction of such a scheme.</P>
      <P>Submissions were invited from the public so that the views of all concerned parties would be considered in the design of an appropriate scheme. The deadline for receipt was 31 October 2000 and comments submitted are now being examined and compiled. Relevant findings and studies would also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The recent debate has highlighted the lack of a common approach at EU level to the regulation of traditional or alternative medicinal products, including herbal medicinal products. As the Deputy is aware this matter is being addressed by a working group set up by the EU Pharmaceutical Committee last year. This and other relevant working groups continue to be attended by representatives of the IMB.</P>
      <P>Any national scheme introduced must, of necessity, be on an interim basis pending the introduction of appropriate EU measures. Obviously in drawing up any national interim scheme consideration will be given to regulatory models in use in other member states.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident took place on 4 November 1999. A blood box was labelled by the IBTS in Pelican House for delivery to Castlebar General Hospital. This was inadvertently mislabelled by Fastrack at Heuston Station and subsequently delivered to University College Hospital, Galway.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures available from the National Disease Surveillance Centre indicate that 1,554 cases of measles were reported up to 21 October 2000. This represents an increase of 1,434 cases over the same period last year. While there are indications that the current measles epidemic is being brought under control, it remains very important that the maximum number of children are immunised against the disease.</P>
      <P>In view of the current primary immunisation uptake levels generally, and especially in relation to MMR, I have asked the health boards to make every effort to achieve the national target of 95% in the primary childhood immunisation programme this year.</P>
      <P>The health boards indicate that a range of measures is being adopted to improve the uptake of MMR and the other primary vaccinations.</P>
      <P>These include accelerated MMR booster campaigns at school level; the identification and follow-up of unimmunised children in the community; targeting of groups or geographic areas where there are particular problems with uptake; general practitioners being asked to make special efforts to promote immunisation to parents; and awareness campaigns to inform the public about the importance of MMR immunisation at national and regional level.</P>
      <P>The national immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, in its 1999 guidelines, recommended the bringing forward of the age at which an MMR booster is given to four to five year olds. Previously it had been recommended at 11-12 years. When these guidelines were published in February 2000, my Department requested the health boards to implement this change in the MMR immunisation schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed about an alleged link between the MMR vaccine and the <Col N="390" /> development of certain conditions or disorders. I reiterate that my Department has reviewed the available evidence and is satisfied that the MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. There is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development either of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or of autism and studies published in the UK and Europe have further confirmed this. Neither is there evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccine.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, strongly urge parents in all areas of the country to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella for individual children and the population generally.</P>

      <P>In line with the recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy aimed at heightening awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding among the general public, I have provided funding to La Leche League of Ireland to produce a television campaign on the benefits of breastfeeding. I understand that this campaign will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>In continuing to support the promotion of breastfeeding in Ireland and in line with the objectives of the Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005, I propose to establish the post of national breastfeeding co-ordinator. The post has been recently advertised and it is hoped that an appointment will follow without delay. The establishment of this post is recognition of this Government's commitment to further awareness on the benefits of breastfeeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Quality of life in relation to health is a broader concept than personal health status and also takes social well-being into account. There is no consensus over a single definition of quality of life although there is general agreement that its components include functional ability, including work-related functioning, degree and quality of social interaction, psychological well-being, coping with pain and self-assessed satisfaction <Col N="391" /> with life. It is, therefore, a complex concept representing individual responses to the physical, mental and social effects of illness and the extent to which these influence personal satisfaction with life.</P>
      <P>Based on the above considerations, there are as yet no internationally agreed composite measures for assessing quality of life. The World Health Organisation &ndash; WHO &ndash; is engaged in an EU-funded project &ndash; EUROHIS &ndash; with the aim of arriving at agreed indicators across a range of data amenable to collection by means of health interview surveys. While agreement has been reached in a number of areas, work is still ongoing with respect to quality of life indicators.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, life expectancy has been used as a composite measure to the extent that, at a population level, longevity can serve as a proxy for good health. More recently, the concept of disability-adjusted life expectancy &ndash; DALE &ndash; has been introduced which allows the estimation of life expectancy free from disability. The WHO uses this measure in its recent report on health systems, and my Department recognises its added-value in providing a more informative measure of health than simple life expectancy measures. The WHO also utilises an indicator of equality of child survival which can also be a useful measure of underlying health. In addition to these indicators, my Department is also following closely other developmental work in relation to a range of new quality of life indicators. Most of these fall under the heading of health expectancy measures and can be expressed in terms of life expectancy in a defined state of health such as impairment, disability, self-rated health and other concepts.</P>

      <P>In the first instance, the provision of health related support services, including occupational therapy, to persons with physical or sensory disabilities is the responsibility of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy physiotherapy and speech and language therapy needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including occupational therapists. Among the issues examined by this group were the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the workforce planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established, will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also very pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, I have secured a total of 52 extra places for the training of physiotherapists, five additional places for the training of occupational therapists and three in <Col N="393" /> the area of speech and language therapy, all available from October 2000.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a fast-track physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. The first graduates from these programmes should be available in 2003.</P>
    <P>The possibility of establishing a similar course for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for the accident and emergency facilities at the hospital concerned now rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I am aware of the difficulties being encountered by hospitals delivering accident and emergency services and in particular the problem of overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>Approval has been sought from my Department for the development of a new acute assessment unit and a major upgrading of the emergency department facilities at the hospital and I have recently announced support for this.</P>
      <P>This new unit will be located adjacent to the hospital's accident and emergency department and will provide for speedier consultant interaction and improved services for patients. It is anticipated that this will reduce the number of investigations as earlier intervention and diagnosis to a more senior appropriate clinical level will result in a shorter average length of stay for patients and more efficient use of hospital beds.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the allocation of an additional £25 million as part of a winter initiative designed to reduce the pressures on acute hospitals over the winter period. This funding will enable specific initiatives to be taken including initiatives in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For patients who require admission to hospital, the shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough, to cater for new patients requiring admission to the hospital, particularly those in accident and emergency departments. Additional step-down beds will be available to the hospital this year. As part of the winter initiative the <Col N="394" /> ERHA will have access to an additional 495 beds by the end of March 2001.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that a report on accident and emergency services was submitted to the board of the Eastern Regional Health Authority recently. This report forms the basis for the terms of reference for an review of accident and emergency services in the region. The objective of this review is to examine in detail the existing accident and emergency services and to bring forward a comprehensive policy which will improve access and reduce waiting times for treatment and admission. I understand that an interim report of the review group is due to be presented to the board of the authority in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 202 and 512 together.</P>
      <P>MRSA is a significant infection which occurs in hospitals and in the community. There are many contributing factors including the use of antibiotics and the control of infection in our hospitals. Guidelines for acute hospitals and other facilities were developed and circulated to health boards in 1999.</P>
      <P>MRSA is not a statutorily notifiable infectious disease and so statistics on its occurrence are not routinely compiled by my Department. The list of notifiable diseases is currently being reviewed by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and I expect that their recommendations will include making MRSA a notifiable disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey of MRSA carried out in spring 1995 indicated a prevalence of 16.5 per 1000 discharges. In 1998 a repeat MRSA study was commissioned by my Department. It was carried out under the direction of the Eastern Regional <Col N="395" /> Health Authority. Data was gathered in the North and South on all MRSA cases over a two week period in February 1999. The report cautions against over interpreting the results of the study. The MRSA prevalence per 1,000 discharges from acute hospitals was 7.8 in the North and 15.4 for the South, but whether the higher proportion found in the South was due to a higher level of screening is unknown. In addition, a much wider range of institutions are defined as &ldquo;acute&rdquo; in the South compared to the North. For these reasons the figures are not readily comparable.</P>
    <P>In light of the higher MRSA prevalence in the south a higher incidence rate would also have been expected but this was not found to be the case.</P>
    <P>Information on the number of deaths attributed to MRSA is not available. Patients may die with MRSA but not from MRSA.</P>
    <P>MRSA is part of the broader issue of antimicrobial resistance. In addition to commissioning the North-South study of MRSA, my Department also asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre to evaluate the problem of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. Both reports are being considered and proposals to address the problem are being formulated, which I hope to announce in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 203 together.</P>
      <P>There is only one level of general nurse in Ireland, that of registered general nurse &ndash; RGN. This is equivalent to the United Kingdom qualification of registered general nurse. The minimum training required to achieve this qualification or its equivalent throughout the European Union is laid down in EU directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The state enrolled nurse &ndash; SEN &ndash; qualification is a United Kingdom qualification which is not recognised in Ireland. However, a number of holders of that qualification are employed in the <Col N="396" /> health service in other capacities, such as ward attendants and care assistants.</P>
    <P>I understand that the course in question is a conversion programme for enrolled nurses leading to professional registration as a nurse with the relevant UK regulatory body and the award of an academic qualification. While I am not in a position to provide funds to assist enrolled nurses working in the Irish public health service in non-nursing capacities to undertake that particular course, I intend to explore with An Bord Altranais and other relevant bodies whether it would be possible to deliver such a course here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 190 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service &ndash; IBTS &ndash; is a matter for its board of management. The overall objective of the board is to develop a national cohesive organisation which meets the needs of the country's hospital services effectively and efficiently. This objective is based on the need to address weaknesses identified in a number of reports including the report of the <Col N="397" /> expert group on the BTSB, the Bain report and the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB &ndash; Finlay report.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing process of change in the IBTS and a multi-million pound investment is being made in the service's development programme. Staff have recently moved into a purpose-built national blood centre at James's Street. This new facility is among the best and most modern transfusion centres in the world and includes a state of the art plasmapherisis clinic for the collection of platelets. On October 11 last, I was pleased to meet the board of the IBTS informally, and to inspect the new facilities at the national blood centre. New and improved facilities will also come on stream towards the end of November at D'Olier Street in Dublin for donors of whole blood.</P>
    <P>Further investment has been made at the Cork centre in order to upgrade facilities and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority. The Department made capital grants available during 1998 and 1999 to complete the following works: a new components processing laboratory; a new product storage area; an upgrade of the donor clinic; and new office accommodation. The IBTS considers that further capital investment in the Cork centre is desirable and has approved an outline planning brief in this regard. A more detailed planning brief is now being prepared and a project team has been established within the IBTS. The Department will consider any application from the IBTS for further capital investment in the Cork centre as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>A new decentralised collection centre has recently been established in Carlow, collecting blood from the south east and south midlands. A mobile collection team which will collect blood in the north midlands and the north east will be established in Ardee, County Louth, early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Additional medical, scientific, technical and quality assurance staff have been recruited to continue to ensure that the service is in line with, or ahead of, major developments in international transfusion medicine. The IBTS is introducing a major new testing programme in advance of most other transfusion centres internationally. All of these developments will contribute to a modern and reinvigorated blood transfusion service to meet the challenges of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>In addition to the supply of blood and blood products, the statutory functions of the IBTS also include the provision of advice, information and assistance to myself and my Department, and to any health authority. The IBTS also plays an important role in the organisation and provision of, or assistance to, research and training in matters relating to blood transfusion. The IBTS is carefully monitoring emerging trends which may impact on transfusion services in the future, such as the development of blood substitutes, and the emergence of new viruses.</P>
    <P>In May 1995, a strategy to consolidate donor testing to a single location was recommended to <Col N="398" /> the board of the then BTSB following a major consultancy exercise undertaken by Bain Consultants and was unanimously adopted. A report on the implications of centralising donation testing was prepared by the national medical director and the chief executive officer of the BTSB in 1998. This report, which strongly recommended that the board should centralise donation testing, was unanimously adopted by the board in July 1999. The board decided to proceed with the detailed planning for centralised testing and to address the concerns of medical practitioners in the Munster region.</P>
    <P>In April 2000 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children published its report on single site testing of blood products. The joint committee considered that the import of the presentations made to it might be &ldquo;that the security, backup and synergy provided through enhancing the present two site testing arrangements seems significantly superior to relying on a new and as yet unproven centre for all the country's blood testing facilities&rdquo;. The report also refers to the need to ensure optimal patient care in accordance with international practice and to optimise resources to the maximum possible degree. It also refers to the risk of contamination of centralised laboratories and of closure due to industrial problems. I understand that the board's consideration of the report is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The committee's report also refers to contention between two of the IBTS centres. I have raised this matter with the board and I believe that there is a strong obligation on all concerned to resolve outstanding issues that have given rise to this tension.</P>
    <P>For the future, transfusion medicine will continue to develop and bring new challenges and demands. The IBTS will monitor these demands and adapt and change to meet requirements. It will also continue to monitor the needs of its donors, the needs of patients and hospitals and the development of international standards. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to support the IBTS in achieving and maintaining the highest standards of blood safety over the coming years and in meeting the challenges of new developments in transfusion medicine. The service's most immediate priority is to ensure an adequate and safe blood supply. I encourage members of the public to donate and to continue to support this vital service.</P>

      <P>Among the essential elements for successful immunisation programmes is the availability of <Col N="400" /> safe and effective vaccines in which the public can have complete confidence. In that regard, my Department is in regular contact with the Irish Medicines Board in relation to issues which arise from time to time in relation to vaccines used in public immunisation programmes in this country. In any case where the Irish Medicines Board advises that a product should not continue to be used, this is acted upon immediately by my Department.</P>
      <P>The UK-based manufacturing plant which was the subject of a critical report from the United States Food and Drug Administration following an inspection carried out in July 1999, had also been inspected by the UK Medicines Control Agency. Both agencies independently arrived at similar conclusions. The manufacturing plant concerned has now put in place the necessary corrective actions to resolve the problems identified and both the Food and Drug Administration and the Medicines Control Agency are satisfied that the product concerned, 'flu vaccine, is safe.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board maintains close liaison with the UK Medicines Control Agency in relation to the latter's monitoring of the manufacturing plant cited in recent reports. The Irish Medicines Board has been assured by the Medicines Control Agency that the vaccines manufactured at the plant concerned meet the appropriate standards.

      <P>The strategy being pursued by the health promotion unit of my Department in relation to breastfeeding is in accordance with the recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy. This policy has guided developments and initiatives in relation to the promotion of breastfeeding. While many recommendations have been implemented, it is acknowledged that the incidence of breastfeeding in this country continues to be lower than that of our European counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the health promotion strategy pub<Col N="401" /> lished in July this year calls for a more structured approach to the implementation of the recommendations set out in the national breastfeeding policy and recommends the appointment of a national breastfeeding co-ordinator. The post was recently advertised in the national papers and, when appointed, the successful candidate will advise the health promotion unit on the effectiveness of current policy actions in Ireland and on measures required to increase breastfeeding rates. I am currently finalising the establishment of a re-constituted national committee on breastfeeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 586 together.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, is the national paediatric cardiac centre and there has been concern over waiting times for children in this speciality. Some of the measures cited by the hospital as contributing to the increasing pressure on this service were the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and advances in surgical and interventional techniques available.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 the hospital was allocated a sum of £500,00 from the cardiac waiting list initiative to implement measures aimed at reducing pressures in the most effective and appropriate manner. The hospital proposed to use the funding for a number of measures. These included the provision of an additional four ICU beds, the implementation of a training programme for ICU nurses and the purchase of cardiac procedures from appropriate UK paediatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>In 1998, 1999 and 2000 under the same initiative the hospital was allocated sums of £878,550, £679,000 and £700,000 respectively.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is in a position to respond to the need for its cardiology/cardiac surgery services. In this regard the Deputy may wish to note that my Department has sanctioned a major theatre development at the hospital. This theatre development, when completed, will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. It is anticipated that tenders for the work will issue in January 2001 with commencement of work on site in spring of 2001. This development is expected to cost in the region of £20 million.  </P>
      <P>Also, an additional cardiothoracic surgeon commenced duty at the hospital in August of this year and the hospital has recently submitted an application for a fourth consultant cardiologist. Two consultant anaesthetist posts have also been recently advertised by the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the implementation of the above measures will enable Our Lady's Hospital to provide enhanced cardiac surgery services for all children within the country.</P>

      <P>The cardiovascular strategy report &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts &ndash; makes a number of recommendations for general practice in relation to that area playing a fuller role in the cardiovascular strategy. For example, the report proposes that a systematic approach be taken in primary care to the risk assessment, secondary prevention and ongoing management of those identified as being high risk.</P>
      <P>The report was adopted and a task force and advisory forum established to progress its work with significant funding being made available. Primary care has benefited significantly from that funding which has allowed a number of cardiovascular related initiatives and necessary infrastructural development in general practice to be undertaken. Further, funding was also made available under the cardiovascular programme for pilot projects of secondary prevention in two health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 2001, and subsequently, it is proposed to further develop and extend the cardiovascular capacity of general practice in line with Building Better Hearts. This will necessarily be influenced, to some extent, by the review of general practitioner services currently being finalised by the health board chief executive officers and, in particular, its findings on the infrastructural issues surrounding general practice's ability to deliver <Col N="405" /> particular services, including those identified in the cardiovascular report.  </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 484 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. This review is in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I have presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of short to medium term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors.</P>
      <P>One of the issues identified in the interim report to Government was the need to alleviate anticipated service pressures over the winter period. In this regard I was pleased to announce recently an investment package of £25 million to address a number of key service issues in the acute and non-acute sectors. The investment is being targeted at a number of areas, including the provision of additional step down facilities for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment. Many of these patients are older people and require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment. Under the winter initiative, at least 500 additional nursing home places will be contracted from private nursing homes. I am satisfied that this element of the initiative will increase the capacity of the acute hospital sector to address the problem of inappropriate use of hospital beds and will enhance the level of step down care available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second phase of the bed review is now under way and will involve the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and <Col N="406" /> non-acute sectors. The review will also involve a more detailed assessment of need, including an analysis of future bed requirements by specialty. I anticipate that the review will be completed in spring 2001.</P>
    <P>Finally, as part of the bed review, officials from my Department have held discussions with the IHCA and will be meeting again in the coming weeks as the review is further advanced.</P>

The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is responsible for paying the respite care grant in cases where a person is in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance or in cases where a person is in receipt of carer's allowance only. The health boards are responsible for paying the respite care grant in cases where a person is in receipt of domiciliary care allowance only.

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled, under statute, to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
      <P>The future development of the registration service is being considered in the context of the joint initiative being undertaken by my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to identify and implement the changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events. It is intended to capitalise on the use of modern technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration in a modern, efficient and legally adequate system. It is proposed that in the future records of life events will be linked. The objective is to implement a modern, efficient and effective system geared to the needs of the 21st century. Funding of £7.3 million for the modernisation programme was approved in 1999.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware of the steps that are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. When this archival records project is completed, it will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> It is planned to publish a consultation document in December 2000 on the future development of the registration service and to obtain the views of all interested parties. In the interim, as the Deputy may be aware, the General Register Office has taken a number of measures to improve its services, including provision of additional space in the public reading room and the refurbishment of this facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed changes to the arrangements for medical indemnity cover have two principal objectives. The first is to rationalise the existing arrangements which have developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis into a single indemnity scheme. This should speed up the settlement of cases where patients have legitimate claims for compensation. It should also help in the defence of claims where there is not a solid case for compensation. The second objective is to improve the quality of patient care through the introduction of comprehensive risk management programmes in hospitals and other healthcare settings. These will help identify and reduce errors which may otherwise go unreported.</P>
      <P>Under Irish law a citizen is entitled to sue any individual or corporate entity which he or she believes has treated them negligently. Under the proposed new scheme, hospitals would accept vicarious liability for the acts and omissions of their doctors as they already accept for all other staff.</P>
      <P>If risk management programmes identify areas of practice or aspects of service provision which need to be improved, there is an obligation to rectify those problems or face the risk of further litigation with less likelihood of being able to present a successful defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure have been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. In October 1999, the faculty of public health medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I considered it timely to set up a forum on fluoridation with terms of reference as follows: to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area; and to report and to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum is comprised largely of persons with <Col N="410" /> expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality and health promotion. Environmental interests have been invited but so far have declined. The forum will invite submissions from the public. The forum has already met on a number of occasions under the chairmanship of Professor Pat Fottrell. I hope to have an interim report from the forum by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Republic of Ireland, United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland all have fluoridated piped public water supplies. In this country, because of circumstances such as its geographical size and water distribution system, it was feasible to implement water fluoridation on a nationwide basis. Other countries did not have this advantage. A number of countries have fluoridated salt on the market as an alternative means of fluoridation.</P>
    <P>The fluoridation programme in Ireland is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. The following information which I received from the health boards in October, 2000 outlines the total costs to the boards of the fluoridation programme:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>An independent evaluation of the drug services provided by the Eastern Health Board, now Eastern Regional Health Authority, was carried out in 1999 by Dr. Michael Farrell, of the National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry in London. His report which was published in January 2000 indicated that methadone maintenance is one of the most widely evaluated treatments for opioid dependence worldwide. Internationally, there is a well established research and a clinical evidence base for substitution treatment with methadone. In general, methadone maintenance is associated with lower rates of heroin consumption, reduced levels of crime and improved social functioning. A lower risk of premature mortality among maintained patients has been reported <Col N="411" /> and substitution programmes have also contributed to the prevention of the spread of HIV infection.</P>
      <P>Dr. Farrell's report also found that a number of satellite clinics in the eastern region informally reported rates of 40% plus of those on methadone returning to work. Although it is acknowledged that this may partly be due to the current work climate which exists in Dublin it also states that this high percentage is very striking as evidence of successful social habilitation or rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Dr. Farrell concluded that there has been a remarkable degree of activity and expansion within the services in the region over the past four to five years. This expansion has lead to Ireland having one of the more innovative community drug service programmes in Europe. Dr. Farrell made a number of recommendations which the Eastern Regional Health Authority is now endeavouring to implement.</P>

      <P>The Government, on the recommendation of the National Millennium Committee, approved the allocation of £2 million of millennium funding towards the cost of two flagship projects of Dublin Corporation, the Liffey of lights and the Liffey boardwalk.</P>
      <P>This millennium funding is apportioned as follows: £500,000 towards the Liffey of lights project on the basis of an estimated total cost of £1.09 million and £1.5 million towards the boardwalk on the basis of an estimated total cost of £1.963 million. To date a total of £633,750 of this millennium funding has been drawn down for these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Liffey of lights projects was completed at the end of 1999 in time for the New Year's Eve celebrations. I understand from Dublin Corpor<Col N="413" /> ation, which is responsible for both these projects, that the Liffey boardwalk is expected to be completed in early December.</P>

      <P>The text of the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000, is currently being finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government with a view to publication later this month and passage through both Houses in the current autumn session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a unique and innovative social policy that seeks to support people during a difficult period by allowing employees to take up to 65 <Col N="414" /> weeks unpaid leave to look after persons in need of full-time care and attention. The Bill complements the Government's budget 2000 proposal to introduce from October a carer's benefit scheme administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a further recognition by the Government of the important role played by carers in our society and that we must continue to provide support and practical assistance to those carers. The Bill will make it possible for workers to make the temporary choice of becoming a carer without loss of employment and where possible, care recipients may be cared for in the home.</P>

      <P>Further to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 170 and 172 of 24 October 2000, I confirm that the Employment Equality Act, 1998, prohibits discrimination in employment on grounds of gender and, therefore, any extension of eligibility criteria considered for the community employment programme will apply equally to men and women.</P>

      <P>Approval to pay the 5.5% PPF and 3% early settlers payments was given to FÁS in early October. The approval covered staff in the community training workshops.</P>
      <P>An outstanding 2% increase under Partnership 2000 will be implemented this week in respect of CTW staff, following negotiations between FÁS and my Department. This increase preceded the PPF increases and has had the effect of delaying the implementation of the 5.5% PPF and 3% early settlers payments. CTW staff have been informed that every effort is being made to have the increases paid as soon as possible, but not later than the end of November.</P>

      <P>The company is a subsidiary of a small private German company. The company was approved grant assistance by IDA Ireland in 1997 to establish an operation at Carrick-on-Shannon to manufacture kitchen utensils. Last month it was announced that production at the Carrick-on-Shannon plant was to cease. Grant liability is repayable to IDA Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS placement services have registered ten of the workers from the plant in Carrick-on-Shannon and FÁS is now writing to each of the remaining workers inviting them to attend for a quality registration interview. As a result of this interview process, FÁS will carry out a skills analysis. The skills analysis report will be used by FÁS to organise suitable training courses, based <Col N="419" /> on the needs of the workers, and these will be delivered in the location most appropriate to them. This report will be available to the industrial development agencies. The full facilities available to FÁS north-west will be directed towards helping those workers who need them to return to the workforce as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The company owns its factory in Carrick-on-Shannon, which it intends to sell, and IDA Ireland is liasing closely with the company on marketing the facility for an alternative industry.</P>
    <P>Management has informed IDA Ireland that several of the employees have already secured alternative employment in the area. It is also hoped that many of the employees will secure alternative employment at another company which has agreed a project with IDA for Carrick-on-Shannon to create 300 jobs. Construction of a purpose built 50,000 sq.ft. facility for this project is well under way and this company will commence recruitment in the first quarter of 2001.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme, JI, is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unem<Col N="420" /> ployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of JI is to progress participants into mainstream employment. The responsibility for the management of JI projects rests with the sponsors who undertake at the outset that they have established an organisational structure that can effectively manage JI projects.</P>
      <P>A review of the JI programme was commissioned by my Department during 1999 and was undertaken by Deloitte &amp; Touche, consultants. One of the recommendations put forward by the consultants was that a budget allocation per team leader, comparable to that available on the community employment programme, be made available to managing agents. Following consultations with the social partners represented on the standing committee on the labour market, it was decided that the resources of the local employment service should be utilised fully in the first instance to providing a more effective service to JI participants before considering other options.</P>
      <P>Supervisors on CE in addition to administration duties, are responsible for drawing up a participant development plan based on the needs of each participant. The needs of workers on JI are being evaluated by FÁS and the LES on an ongoing basis. All aspects of the operation of the JI programme, including the possible need in the future for the position of team leaders, are being kept under close review by my Department.</P>

      <P>The attraction of industry to particular locations in the country is a day to day matter for IDA Ireland. The Government, however, is committed to an equitable regional distribution of job opportunities as detailed in the national development plan. In the pursuit of this objective, I have impressed on the industrial development agencies the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The former Neodata building in Kilmallock is a facility suitable for a telemarketing centre and is being marketed as such by IDA Ireland. It has proved difficult to date to attract a telemarketing company to Kilmallock, due to a reluctance on the part of companies to move outside the larger urban centres of Limerick and Tralee in the mid-West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland is conscious that a number of former employees of Neodata live in the Kilmallock area and this could prove useful in the event of a <Col N="421" /> suitable telemarketing company wishing to establish a project in the town.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland will continue to market the former Neodata building and the Kilmallock area for suitable inward investment projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>There has been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of insurance premiums, in the area of public liability. This examination has focused on a number of the key cost elements, including the levels of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. Concurrent with this examination, efforts are being made to identify measures, which both individually and cumulatively could have a moderating effect on public liability insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche Report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the main contributory factors, to rising premium costs, were the high legal costs component of small claim settlement; the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general <Col N="427" /> damages awards, relative to special damages in smaller claims.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report also identified improved health and safety measures in workplaces as a way of reducing costs. I would regard the initiatives on the establishment of affinity schemes for small businesses and the development of a voluntary code of practice, in safe working and accident prevention, as significant and positive measures being taken by Irish business, to reduce the cost burden of accidents in workplaces.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the relative high cost of public liability insurance can present adverse consequences for voluntary activity. However, it is worth noting that very often there can be substantial differences in the quotes offered by the various insurance companies for liability cover and I would always encourage people, including voluntary groups, to shop around for a competitive quote or to engage the services of an insurance broker.</P>
    <P>In the case of public liability, and particularly for voluntary organisations, it is also important that organisations consider meeting with insurance companies so that the insurers are completely aware of the level and extent of the risk for which cover is sought. Very often an insurer can quote for cover in excess of what is actually necessary. An example would be an insurer quoting for liability cover for an entire year when in fact cover is being required for weekends only.</P>

      <Quest> the position regarding an application by a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5 for a pension under the Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Act 2000; if this claim can be adjudicated on within the scope of the Act; if she has any discretion in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Act, 2000, does not allow for the payment of pensions to former employees of the company. It allows for payment of a lump sum of £20,000 each to certain former employees who had been employed in the company for a period of not less than two years which was a period of continuous employment and continued to be so employed on 1 November 1986 or later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the person concerned, the committee established under the Act has reviewed his application. The committee has found that his application is ineligible for the payment because it does not meet these requirements and, in par<Col N="428" /> ticular, it does not meet the requirement of being employed by Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited on 1 November 1986 or later. In the circumstances, his application has been refused.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that any refusal may be appealed within 21 days of the receipt by him of the notification.</P>

      <Quest> the percentage of interviewees under the employment action plan not being placed in either a job, training or education within one month of their interview in the age groups under 25, 25 to 34 and 35 to 55; the plans she has to improve these statistics; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>When referred to FÁS, each individual's progress and career guidance process is tracked using a sophisticated caseload tracking system. The aim is to refer within one month as many clients as possible to a job, training or education course or some other support such as a jobs club. The referral month is essentially a period of engagement, preparation and guidance of the job-seeker so that the most appropriate and suitable career path is chosen by them. The real results of this process are therefore more likely to be seen in the subsequent period.</P>
      <P>For example, in the case of the 557 young people, unemployed for six months, who were originally referred for FÁS interview in June-last we see that of the 330 young people who had attended for interview by FÁS: 30% (98) had been placed by FÁS in jobs or on programmes at end September (as compared with 23% in August and 16% in July); a further 35% (116) had left the LR; a further 7% (23) had been referred for an upcoming programme place and were still on the LR; 15% (49) were still on the LR and receiving continuing intensive support from their FÁS case-support officer-guidance, assistance with job-search, etc. The proportion in this category had fallen from 25% in August and 35% in July; no current FÁS action was being taken in 13% (44) of cases, even though the individual was still on the LR; and these cases were due for review by DSCFA; 73% of non-attendees had also signed off the LR by the end of September.</P>
      <P>The remaining interviewees are either placed, are referred for training, are not ready to progress due to health problems etc., have dropped out of the process or have signed off the live register of their own accord. The following table outlines the position for each category of EAP referrals.</P>

    <P>A new service called &ldquo;Job Connect&rdquo; has just been launched by FÁS employment services which is designed to improve immediate access of job-seekers to suitable vacancies. Using the 1850-611116 number, job-seekers in the Dublin area initially, can have immediate telephone access to a trained FÁS employment services officer. The job-seeker can be transferred directly by phone to an employer who has a vacancy that matches the agreed career path of the job-seeker. This is achieved through conference-calling technology and newly developed FÁS software systems.</P>

      <P>The aviation sector in Ireland is in a very buoyant state generally.</P>
      <P>Given the state of the sector it was disappointing to hear that this company has gone into liquidation with the loss of such a large number of jobs in Ireland. I can confirm that a liquidator has been appointed and he has been in touch with my Department regarding redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the majority of the company's staff based in Ireland will be able to get employment in the aviation sector here within a short period of time if they so wish.</P>
      <P>To that end, I can assure the Deputy that the full services of FÁS will be made available to those that require them. Indeed, the FÁS regional director has already been in touch with the company to offer assistance which will enable the employees to find alternative suitable employment. I do not consider the establishment of a special task force to be warranted in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>Along with our European Union partners, Ireland considers that the International Labour Organisation, ILO, remains the most appropriate forum for advancing respect for, and compliance with, agreed labour standards.</P>
      <P>In June 1999, the ILO adopted Convention No. 182 concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. Ireland was the first EU member state to ratify this Convention on 20 December 1999. The onus is on individual ILO member states to ensure that their national legislation and practice are in conformity with that convention.</P>
      <P>With a view to promoting a better understanding of the relationship between trade policy, trade liberalisation, development and fundamental human rights, the European Union is proposing the establishment of a broad and regular dialogue on trade and social development, which should include, but not be limited to, the issue of core labour standards. Such a dialogue should involve the ILO, WTO, UNCTAD, World Bank and other international organisations and could be launched in advance of the next WTO ministerial meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland supports the EU commitment to the principles of the agreement reached at the WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore on trade and core labour standards. The Singapore Declaration is very clear: respect for core labour rights, but rejection of protectionism, and acceptance of <Col N="431" /> the comparative advantages of developing countries, etc. These principles remain the basis of the EU approach.</P>
    <P>We need to move forward the co-operation between ILO and WTO and inject some operational sense. The proposed dialogue would meet this objective.</P>

      <P>I established the Ballinrobe Task Force in January 1999 following the closure of the Betatherm Ireland Limited plant.</P>
      <P>The task force undertook a study concerning the 35 employees of the company. Thirty employees responded to the questionnaire and it was discovered that, of these 30, 17 had found alternative employment.</P>
      <P>The local employment services group also organised training for 14 people by FÁS in order to assist these people to return to work.</P>
      <P>Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland fully recognise the need to attract new business into Ballinrobe. The promotion of the 22,000 sq.ft. advance factory in the town is very much a priority for IDA Ireland at present.</P>
      <P>The industrial development agencies promote each location to its best advantage. However, it is important to realise that the final decision on where any project locates is made by the promoter of the project and not by the agencies.</P>
      <P>Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland continue to work with existing companies in the area in an effort to develop them and encourage expansion of their businesses if at all possible.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that significant investments in infrastructure have been made by Mayo County Council, all of which are beneficial to the marketing effort in attracting new investments.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am hopeful that the fact that Ballinrobe is in the new Border, midlands and west region, with the positive EU differential for this region compared to the rest of the country, will lead to the generation of new projects for the area.</P>

      <P>The community employment, CE, programme was restructured during 1999, to take account of the fall in unemployment levels and to better target available places at older long-term unemployed persons. As part of this process and in consultation with the social partners a decision was taken to gradually reduce the numbers employed on CE. To ensure that the services provided under CE for disabled persons are not adversely affected by the restructuring of the programme these services are classified as a priority by FÁS and have been protected from the phased reductions imposed on <Col N="433" /> other categories of projects such as in the environment and education sectors.</P>
      <P>The short-term nature of CE participation, three years being the maximum term, is clearly not compatible with the needs of disabled persons. In this regard my Department is currently engaged in discussions with the Department of Health and Children on the possible mainstreaming of these services to that Department. The Department of Health and Children, which has primary responsibility for funding in this area, is supportive in principle of the proposal. The modalities involved are currently being considered by the two Departments in consultation with FÁS.</P>
      <P>Proposals on the mainstreaming of CE services for disabled persons will be discussed with the social partners within the framework of the PPF standing committee on the labour market.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals he has to give lobster fishermen, who have no tonnage or licence, an opportunity to secure such a licence in view of the fact that such fishermen are fishing for lobster traditionally and depend on it for their income to a large degree.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The licensing of vessels proposing to fish for lobster is subject to the normal conditions and requirements of licensing policy, including the removal of full equivalent capacity from the sea fishing boat register. This policy is designed to ensure compliance with the mandatory capacity objectives for the Irish fishing fleet which are set down in the EU multi-annual guidance programme for Ireland up to the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>A special scheme was introduced some years ago, with EU approval, to regularise the position of small fishing vessels which, although part of the fishing fleet, had not been formally licensed or registered. The closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme, which applied to small vessels which were demonstrably part of the fleet prior to 1989, was 17 February 1995.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at present for a further scheme of this nature, which would require EU approval. I have, however, asked my Department to examine whether there is any objective necessity for pursuing the case for a further scheme with the Commission, in the context of the overall circumstances of the inshore fisheries sector, as well as the implications for overall fleet management policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In early October, my Department received a complaint that the Dublin Port Company, DPC, had undertaken works at the Stena Terminal without the appropriate consent under the Foreshore Acts, 1933 to 1998. My Department undertook to investigate the matter and immediately arranged a meeting with the DPC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting the DPC admitted that development works were ongoing at the former B&amp;I/current Stena terminal. The DPC stated that it was infilling an area of approximately 0.5 hec<Col N="441" /> tare and that contractors were on site. The company, which owns the foreshore in question, said that, through an oversight, it had overlooked seeking statutory permission.</P>
    <P>The DPC was instructed to stop all unauthorised works immediately. The company did so and stated that it would submit a foreshore application to regularise those works.</P>
    <P>The DPC submitted an application for a consent under the Foreshore Acts. A public consultation process was initiated on 11 October 2000 when the project was advertised in the national press. The public was invited to make written submissions in relation to the application within 14 days.</P>
    <P>The public consultation period has now ended and five submissions were received. As stated in the public advertisement, these submissions have been forwarded to the Dublin Port Company for their response. Once the company has had an opportunity to comment on the submissions, and the technical and scientific staff available to me have had an a opportunity to consider both the submissions and the company's response, a final report will then be made to me and I will make a decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>The application for higher forestry incentives submitted to the European Com<Col N="443" /> mission last year proposed increased premiums levels for those who planted under the Council Regulation 2090/92 as well as for those proposing to plant in the current season. Due to the protracted nature of the discussions with the Commission, I decided that the primary focus would be on securing increases which would have an impact on planting in the current season. The substantial increases announced on 6 March 2000 achieved that objective.</P>
      <P>I and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and our officials, have been involved in negotiations over the past months with the European Commission with a view to securing adequate premium increases for those who planted in earlier years. These negotiations are ongoing.</P>

      <P>As broadcasting remains a non-transferred matter, responsibility for it remains with the British Government rather than with the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. Accordingly, broadcasting does not come within the framework of the North-South Ministerial Council nor of its associated implementation bodies. The language body has, therefore, no statutory role in relation to broadcasting in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As broadcasting remains the policy responsibility of the British Government, the Government has actively pursued this matter through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The Government fully shares the importance attached to this matter by the Deputy and will continue to pursue it with the British authorities and the relevant commercial interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261, 262 and 263 together.</P>
      <P>Plan Colombia sets out the proposals of President Pastrana's Government to address on a broad, integrated and multi-dimensional basis the enormous problems facing that country. The preface to the plan states: &ldquo;We need to build a state for social justice, which will protect all our citizens and uphold their right to life, dignity and property, freedom of belief, opinion and the press . . . we have to reduce the causes and provocations of violence by opening new paths to social participation&rdquo;. The plan encompasses: (1) the peace process; (2) new approaches to the economy; (3) counter-drugs strategy; (4) reform of the justice system and protection of human rights; (5) democratisation and social development.</P>
      <P>The plan envisages overall expenditure of $7.5 billion, $4 billion of which is to be provided by the Colombian Government, with 75% of all moneys to be allocated to socio-economic, human rights and institution-building programmes. President Pastrana has appealed for a total of $3.5 billion in assistance from the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 2000, the US Congress approved $1 <Col N="446" /> billion aid over two years in equipment and training for the Colombian police and army to enhance their anti-drugs capability &ndash; particularly crop eradication on industrial drug plantations.</P>
    <P>More than $300 million was provided by Congress for a range of social, economic and institutional reform programmes including: voluntary alternative crop development for small farmers; environmental protection; assistance for displaced persons; protection for human rights workers; support for Colombian and international NGOs in documenting incidents and patterns of collusion between paramilitaries and state forces; support for the development of a national human rights strategy and the establishment of a network of human rights task forces; reform of the judicial system and criminal code: training of police and judges.</P>
    <P>In discussions to prepare the European Union position on Colombia, Ireland placed particular emphasis on full respect for human rights, meaningful consultation with civil society and the necessity to address the underlying causes of conflict. At the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 9 October, the EU reaffirmed its political support for the peace initiative of President Pastrana, with the adoption of the following conclusions, which propose a specifically European, multi-dimensional programme of support for the peace process, incorporating many of the valid themes advanced by NGOs.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The European Union reaffirms its political support for the peace effort initiated by President Pastrana. Together with the international community, it wishes to be of active assistance in the negotiating process which, against a background of consultation of civil society and with the agreement of all parties, should lead to peace rooted in human rights, humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    <P>Continuing its present efforts, the European Union will implement a substantial European programme of socio-economic and institutional support for the peace process in Colombia, aimed at promoting and protecting respect for human rights, humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms, improving the living conditions of the local populations, encouraging the cultivation of alternative crops and the protection of bio-diversity, and supporting the introduction of structural reforms in all fields that fuel armed conflict&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the international peace process support group in Bogotá on 24 October the EU Presidency made a detailed declaration on behalf of the European Union setting out the broad, multi-dimensiomal approach of the Union. I am arranging for a copy of this declaration to be placed in the library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention in particular to the areas in which the European Union intends to focus its actions: 1. support for the rule of law; 2. the defence of human rights and of international <Col N="447" /> humanitarian law; 3. the fight against the causes of violence, and assistance for the victims of violence; 4. the protection of biodiversity and the environment; and 5. the enhancement of consultation and regional co-operation.</P>
    <P>The declaration sets out a number of specific steps that need to be taken to achieve these objectives. It makes it clear that the European Union sees no alternative to the peace process: there is no military solution which could lead to lasting peace. It stresses that particular attention needs to be paid to the protection of human rights, to respect for international humanitarian law, and to the victims of violence. The use of drugs and the violence which results from it are undermining Colombian society and the Union is ready to develop co-operation to counter this menace. Progress in the peace process will stem from the fight against the causes of violence. That is why the European Union is encouraging the Colombian Government to adopt structural reform policies for reducing inequalities, promoting social development and improving the standard of living, particularly in the countryside.</P>
    <P>At the Bogotá meeting, the European Commission confirmed a contribution to the EU peace support programme of 105 million for the period 2000-06. EU member states outlined their bilateral aid. Ireland, stressing the human rights and other criteria set out in the General Affairs Council conclusions of 9 October, described the projects co-financed with Irish and Colombian NGOs.</P>
    <P>At Bogotá, too, there was a general welcome for the successful outcome of the meeting jointly convened by the Colombian Government and the NGO grouping Paz Colombia, with wide international participation, in Costa Rica from 16-18 October.</P>
    <P>It is expected that international support for the peace process will be finalised at a meeting to be hosted by the EU Commission-Presidency in Brussels during the second week of March 2001.</P>

      <P>A total of £236,530 was dispersed to Irish missionaries and non-governmental organisations in Uganda in 1999. The activities funded included community and rural development projects, provision of primary health care, water supply, sanitation and education and training. A detailed breakdown of the projects funded can be found in the Ireland Aid annual report for 1999, which is available in the Dáil library. In addition, £7,548,007 was expended under the Irish Govern<Col N="448" /> ment's programme of development co-operation with Uganda.</P>
      <P>Some £560,163 has been committed to Irish missionaries and non-governmental organisations in Uganda in 2000 to date. This represents an increase of 136.8% on the 1999 figure. In addition, over £9.6 million has been committed under the Irish Government's programme of development co-operation with Uganda in 2000. These figures represent a very significant increase in the development aid budget for Uganda and they clearly demonstrate Ireland's commitment to building a vibrant and strong development partnership with Uganda. A clear indication of the growing relationship with Uganda was the recent successful State visit to Ireland of the President of the Republic of Uganda, His Excellency Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary objective of the Ireland Aid programme is to assist developing countries in their efforts to achieve sustainable development. The links between demographic factors and sustainable development are accepted by all developed and developing countries, particularly in the aftermath of the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development &ndash; ICPD &ndash; and its review in 1999. The principles and programme of action adopted by the international community at the ICPD recognised the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly on the spacing of their children and to have all the information, education and means to do so. The ICPD principles and programme of action explicitly reject the use of any form of coercion in reproductive health programmes.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some half a million women in the developing world die each year due to pregnancy-related causes and that 350 million women have no access to any form of contraception. The United Nations Population Fund &ndash; UNFPA &ndash; extends assistance to developing countries at their request to help them address reproductive health and population issues. UNFPA is committed by its mandates to the principles of voluntarism and all of its programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its guiding policy, as laid down by its Governing Council in 1985, stipulates that UNFPA is &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services and abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UNFPA has categorically stated that it does <Col N="449" /> not support China's one-child policy and is opposed to targets and quotas to enforce such a policy. The fund has a voluntary reproductive health and family planning programme in China. This programme operates in the 32 counties where the government of China has suspended its one child policy.</P>
    <P>The Irish Embassy in Beijing has reported that UNFPA is deeply sensitive to the human rights aspects of family planning in China and is fundamentally opposed to any element of state coercion. Those opposed to the UNFPA programme tend on occasion to confuse criticism of UNFPA with criticism of China's one-child policy and to assume that UNFPA, because of its co-operation with China's State Family Planning Commission, implicitly endorses the coercive aspects of this policy. The embassy in Beijing can find no evidence to support this argument.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid has been making annual voluntary contributions to UNFPA since 1993. The money provided by Ireland Aid saves the lives of thousands of women each year and helps prevent hundreds of thousands of unwanted pregnancies. Ireland Aid contributed £600,000 to UNFPA in 2000. Through its membership of UNFPA's executive board, Ireland has participated directly in detailed donor discussions on UNFPA's programmes. The executive board approves and monitors UNFPA's country programmes and ensures that UNFPA operates in full accordance with its mandates and policies and employs its resources as efficiently and effectively as possible and in the best interests of the developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Department has a sufficient body of information available to it from these sources to form an accurate assessment of UNFPA's operations. On the basis of that information, and in the light of specific and repeated assurances from UNFPA, I am satisfied that its operations are conducted in full accordance with the principles of voluntarism and with full respect for the rights of individuals.</P>

      <Quest>the total amount of EU development aid which has been unspent over the past ten years; and his views on this in the context of the hunger and poverty of so many in the Third World.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by the Deputy in relation to the disbursement of EU development assistance. Recent evaluations of the EU programmes have uncovered serious flaws in the implementation of EU development aid. These are most starkly evident in the huge unspent balances, now almost 20 billion euros, which have accumulated over the last decade. Ireland has been very supportive of initiatives aimed at reforming policy structures and the management <Col N="450" /> and implementation of the EU's development assistance programme and sees this as the best way to support the change necessary to address the problem of unspent balances.</P>
      <P>The issue of unspent balances is one of the reasons why Ireland, together with a number of other like-minded member states, has been pressing for early action by the Commission to improve the effectiveness of the EU's aid programme. In addition to finding problems in the implementation of development assistance, the recent independent evaluations of the effectiveness of EU aid concluded that the programme suffered from a lack of any clear over-arching statement of EU development aid policy. This lack of clarity is found to have led to fragmentation and inconsistency in the implementation of aid. The EU aid programme is also characterised by excessive internal bureaucracy resulting in lengthy delays in decision making. The administrative structures in the EU, whereby responsibility for the management of the aid programme is divided between three Commissioners has resulted in overlap and internal co-ordination difficulties.</P>
      <P>Ireland supported the Development Council's decision in May to issue a Council policy declaration which will provide a coherent policy basis for EC aid. The statement, which is based on a Commission communication &ndash; EC Development Policy &ndash; issued in May, is expected to be adopted by the Council very shortly. The policy statement will make poverty alleviation the focus of all EU aid programmes and it will also propose streamlining the programme and focusing EU aid in areas where action at EU level has a comparative advantage.</P>
      <P>The Commission has responded to the need to address institutional weaknesses with a detailed communication on the Reform of the Management of External Assistance which is a key part of the overall Commission reform exercise initiated by Commission President Prodi. The communication quite frankly admits to the current weaknesses and sets out ambitious proposals for the reform of EU aid. The proposal contains measures designed to reduce bureaucracy, decentralise decision making and for the allocation of additional staff to deal with the backlog of unspent balances. The efficiency and coherence of the EU development aid is also likely to be improved as a result of the decision to locate responsibility for the identification and implementation of all aid programmes in a single Commission office.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Commission's proposals for a major reform of the financial regulation which governs the management of the EU budget should permit greater flexibility in the allocation of funds. These actions are designed to prevent the build up of unspent allocations in the aid budget in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September and October the General Affairs Council considered the effectiveness of the EU's external assistance. As part of the Council's con<Col N="451" /> clusions the Commission has been asked to prepare a report on the progress of the reform of the aid programme which will be discussed by the council in January.</P>
    <P>Ireland strongly welcomes the Commission proposals for the reform of EC development aid. We see within this process of reform the opportunity to contribute our ideas to address the problem of unspent balances in a constructive way. We have been actively contributing in the Council framework to the preparation of the EU development policy.</P>
    <P>We also welcome the Commission proposals for the reform of the management of development assistance. We have pressed for specific deadlines to be set for implementing the reform package. While much work remains to be done, I believe that the package of Commission reforms should put in place the necessary framework to disburse the backlog of funds, and to make EU development assistance more effective.</P>

      <P>As is normal for appointments of this kind, representations were made to my predecessor by interested persons in Pakistan and Ireland on behalf of a number of candidates for the position of Honorary Consul in Karachi after it became vacant in 1998. Those representations included a letter by Deputy Ellis concerning Mr. Hasib Ahsan Mozzaffar. The Irish Ambassador to Pakistan interviewed 12 people who had expressed interest in the position and-or who had been recommended for it. On the basis of reports from the Ambassador and taking account of the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs, my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, in September 1999 decided that Mr Hasib Ahsan Mozzaffar was a suitable candidate for the post. Mr. Ahsan was appointed with the approval of the Pakistani authorities.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline Ireland's policy in relation to Taiwan; if he will give details on Ireland's stance on the one-China policy of the Chinese Government and its approach to reunification based on the one-country, two-systems principle.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979 and from that <Col N="452" /> time has accepted the One China Policy of the authorities in Beijing. A similar acceptance applies in respect of all countries which maintain diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and therefore our approach is shared by all EU partners, the United States and several other countries.</P>
      <P>Shortly before 1979 the Chinese authorities, under the then leadership of Deng Hsiao Ping, had announced their One China Policy based on the one-country two-systems principle which would apply to the eventual reintegration of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan into China. In accordance with these principles those three areas are part of China but the two-systems principle would allow them to continue with their respective free-market economies and local political systems for a period of 50 years.</P>
      <P>The peaceful reintegration of Hong Kong in 1997 and Macau in 1999 are now matters of history and the situation in these territories is that the two systems principle is being respected.</P>
      <P>In accordance with our acceptance of the One China Policy outlined above, the Government considers Taiwan to be part of China.</P>
      <P>The Government follows very closely developments between the Government of China and the elected representatives of the Taiwanese in Taipei. We have studied carefully a policy document issued earlier this year by the authorities in Beijing on the question of the reintegration of Taiwan into China, and noted with concern that, in certain circumstances, the use of force to achieve this goal was not being ruled out. Our concerns in this regard have been conveyed to the Chinese authorities at the highest level both by the Taoiseach and by the Tánaiste recently. They urged the Chinese authorities to pursue their goal of reintegration through peaceful dialogue. It is the hope of the Government that such dialogue will commence at an early date.</P>
      <P>This concern about the possible use of force is shared by our EU partners, and has also been conveyed to the Chinese authorities by the Union on every appropriate occasion. This was done most recently by the Presidency in Office at the EU-China summit which took place in Beijing on 23 October.</P>
      <P>While we are concerned that dialogue has not yet started between Beijing and Taipei, the Government is also conscious of the pragmatic economic links which continue to grow between the people of Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. We hope that these relationships can assist in promoting a broader dialogue.</P>

These nominations are not legal appointments and must await the signing of a statutory instrument, expected to be made shortly, which provides for the establishment of EirGrid.</P>
    <P>I also intend making appointments to the interim board of the Irish Energy Centre very shortly.</P>

      <P>Standby losses occur in numerous places throughout the home. The most readily recognisable losses are associated with televisions, videos and compact audio. Losses also occur with computers, printers, faxes, telephones, door bells, set top boxes for satellite television, clocks and lights on other appliances, etc. The Irish Energy Centre has estimated that up to 235,000 tonnes of CO2 could be emitted in Ireland due to standby losses.</P>
      <P>Numerous studies have been carried out in Europe which have looked at the scope for reducing these losses. The results of these studies are being used by the European Commission in negotiations with manufacturers of brown goods and power suppliers on voluntary agreements to reduce these losses. Very major improvements in this area can be expected in the next few years. Work is also commencing on bringing televisions into the EU energy labelling scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271 and 275 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contracts governing the four existing PSO routes which link the airports in Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Kerry with Dublin expire in January and February 2001 and in accordance with EU <Col N="458" /> Council Regulation 2408/92, my Department is currently engaged in a tendering exercise to select air carriers for these routes for the next three years. As the Deputies will be aware, I am also establishing two new PSO routes linking Derry and Knock with Dublin and the current tendering process also covers these routes.</P>
    <P>The specifications which must be met by interested air carriers on each of the six PSO routes were published in the EU Official Journal on 15 September and 28 September 2000. In the case of the Knock-Dublin PSO, those specifications include a requirement for at least one daily return flight, seven days per week and the schedule involved should provide for an early morning departure from Knock to Dublin and a late evening return from Dublin to Knock. The minimum seating capacity to be provided is 30 seats each way.</P>
    <P>The invitation to air carriers to tender for the Knock-Dublin route and for the other five PSO routes was published in the EU Official Journal on 16 September 2000. The closing date for submission of tenders was 17 October 2000. In all, four airlines submitted tenders covering the six PSO routes and these are currently being evaluated by my Department. In accordance with regulation 2408/92, copies of the tenders have been sent to the EU Commission and a period of two months must elapse after the deadline for submission of tenders before any selection is made. Our aim is to secure the completion of all necessary procedures in time to ensure continuity of services on the four existing PSO routes when the current contracts expire and that the two new routes to Knock and Derry commence as planned in mid-January.</P>

      <Quest>if she will clarify the status of the proposed rail stations at Lucan South and Lucan North, County Dublin in the context of a platform for change in view of the fact that both stations were originally considered as part of the suburban rail network and having regard to con fusion caused by differing media interpretations of the recently announced proposals.</Quest>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 makes provision for a short-term strategy for the development of suburban rail in the greater Dublin area. The short-term strategy is focused on maximising the use that can be made of the existing suburban rail network. The programme includes the provision of new stations along the network, including one at Lucan South and Lucan North.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Suburban Rail Strategic Review, commissioned by CIE in 1999, and which was completed earlier this year, also confirmed that the provision of a new station at Lucan south should be pursued.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has confirmed that the proposed new station will be incorporated as part of the overall plan to develop the track between Heuston and Sallins. Consultants are currently engaged in a detailed design of this project. The company has also confirmed that discussions are ongoing with South Dublin County Council and the Dublin Transportation Office regarding location of the station and facilities to be provided. The timescale for the development of the station will be dictated by the track project. At this stage it is anticipated that this project will be completed by 2004.</P>
      <P>The Dublin suburban rail strategic review also concluded that a station at Lucan north should be considered for the medium term.</P>

      <P>Bus Átha Cliath has informed me that in February 2000 the real time passenger information system was installed on 14 buses based in Conyngham Road depot. The system was subjected to intensive testing to address both hardware and software issues.</P>
      <P>The first on street display was installed at the outbound stop at Parkgate Street in June this year. This was solely intended to test the unit in the operating environment and check its functionality in service. Currently, this display unit provides information relating to the waiting time for buses on routes 25/25A and has proven reliable in service.</P>
      <P>An additional eight buses were added to the system in August to enhance the significance of the results of testing and evaluation. Since then, all 22 buses have been monitored and have provided the platform for ongoing system testing.</P>
      <P>Following a number of software modifications, the final version of system software was approved by Bus Átha Cliath at the end of October. The company has now commenced the deployment of the system on all remaining buses serving routes operating out of Conyngham Road depot. The installation of electronic bus stop displays is also proceeding.</P>
      <P>It is currently anticipated that the electronic display units for the Lucan QBC will be operational in the first quarter of 2001, with the Clondalkin QBC coming on stream in the second quarter of 2001.</P>

      <P>The DART fleet has comprised 80 carriages since services commenced between Howth and Bray, a distance of 33.2 kilometres, in 1984. Ten new carriages were recently delivered. Four of these units are in service since October with the extension of DART services to Greystones and Malahide, which added an additional 14 kilometres to the system.

      <P>A further 16 carriages have also been delivered recently and will enter service in the spring of next year following commissioning. Twelve more carriages have been ordered and are due for delivery in 2002 and will be in service by summer 2003.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the severe difficulties and safety issues faced by pregnant women and those with mobility problems because of severe overcrowding on DART and suburban mainline trains; the steps being taken to address these safety issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no statutory function in relation to this matter. Responsibility for ensuring the safety of railway operations rests with Iarnród Éireann. Accordingly, it is a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
      <P>However, I am very much aware of the discomfort passengers have experienced due to overcrowding on trains in recent times. There has been continuing growth in passenger numbers using the DART and suburban rail network and this has resulted in heavy loading at peak periods on most Dublin suburban routes.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the fact that this under-capacity of the Dublin suburban rail network is symptomatic of the pressure on the whole public transport system in Dublin and is addressing this issue in the short-term through the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and for the longer term through the DTO strategy 2000-2016.</P>
      <P>I advised the House previously that there are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding on trains either in this country or at EU level. I am aware that the UK Health and Safety Executive last year examined the implications of overcrowding on railways and concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that overcrowding <i>per se</i> is a safety issue.</P>
      <P>However, my Department's railway inspecting officers have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions, drawing its attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review. Iarnród Éireann has commissioned an independent appraisal of the carrying capacity of all its rolling stock to ensure that the carriages are fit for their purpose. I expect that this report will be finalised by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the particular difficulties faced by pregnant women and those with mobility problems, and indeed the elderly, I would hope that there still exists in our society an expectation and acceptance that seats should be given up willingly to such persons.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say there is lack of investment in Bus Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>In 1999, capital funding of just over £28 million pounds was provided by the Exchequer and the EU for the first time for the purchase of over 150 additional buses by Bus Átha Cliath. These buses were used to enhance services, particularly those on the QBCs.</P>
      <P>For this year, Bus Átha Cliath has already ordered 225 additional buses, all of which will be delivered over the coming weeks. One hundred are replacements for existing buses, while 125 will enable Bus Átha Cliath to increase capacity and provide more frequent services.</P>
      <P>This investment in Bus Átha Cliath represents a major investment in bus services in the greater Dublin area and forms part of the national development plan published last October. An amount of £220 million will be spent on the development of the bus network over the life of the plan. Plans are under way to introduce new orbital, local and feeder services, as well as the enhancement of the Nitelink service.</P>
      <P>The amount of subvention paid to Bus Átha Cliath has also been increased by nearly 50% since 1997. The amount of subvention for the past three years to Bus Átha Cliath was as follows: 1997, £7,000,000; 1998, £8,895,000; 1999, £13,244,000.</P>

      <P>However, investment alone will not be enough to achieve the necessary improvements in the public transport service. It will need to be accompanied by institutional, administrative and regulatory reform. This will require legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The sale of six barracks identified as surplus to military requirements is being progressed. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth, Clancy Barracks, will be evacuated in the near future.</P>
      <P>Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is in the process of being sold to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with IDA Ireland. The agreed price is £767,000 and it is hoped that the formalities of this sale can be completed in the near future. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council, all for local community purposes. I have recently agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements have commenced.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, that property is in the process of being sold to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000 and it is anticipated that sale contracts will be signed in the near <Col N="468" /> future. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board earlier this year on foot of that agreement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the aforementioned properties, where sales have been agreed, the sale formalities are in progress and on completion of those formalities the agreed amounts, totalling £8.367 million, will be realised by my Department.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the former Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of this year for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork County development plan and my officials recently met with council officials to discuss various aspects of this matter.</P>
    <P>Further discussions will take place in the near future and the property will be put on the market following adoption of the integrated plan into the Cork County development plan.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need for accommodation for refugees, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, has been used to accommodate Kosovar refugees since May of last year. The barracks is now also providing accommodation for asylum seekers. In view of those needs, it has not been possible to arrange for the disposal of the property. However, this matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated in the near future when alternative accommodation becomes available. The disposal of the property should proceed in 2001.</P>
    <P>As indicated, the disposal of barracks is proceeding and it is expected that in excess of £50 million will be realised from the sale of the properties. The moneys raised will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces. The cost of the barrack re-investment programme is estimated at £50 million. The programme commenced in 1999 and <Col N="469" /> will run until 2003. Provision for this expenditure is being made in my Departments' Estimates.</P>
    <P>The total costs incurred to date, in respect of security and essential maintenance and other services at the vacated military barracks, are as follows:</P>

    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty allowances alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to almost £714,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £115,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. In addition, the total cost of fees incurred to date amounts to £131,292, which includes advertising costs.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 196 of 2 November 1999, the steering group report on the reorganisation of the reserve force has been published; when he will have an implementation plan for the reorganisation of the reserve force; his views on the effect on the moral and effectiveness of reservists of the ongoing delay in commencing implementation in view of the stated six year duration of that plan; the current stage of the reorganisation process; and the time frame for completion.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based upon the report of the special steering group which was completed in September 1999. The report's recommendations have been accepted as providing a general foundation for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its nation-wide geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Force, as envisaged by the steering group, will have to be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which will be based <Col N="470" /> on the steering group's report. The actual implementation of the structural and reorganisation changes will require a period of about six years. I am anxious, given the essential dependence of the Reserve Defence Force on voluntary service, that there should be a further process of consultation before these proposals are finalised. Arrangements are now being made for the launch of this process of consultation, linked to the publication of the steering group report beginning later this month. I am looking forward to meeting a cross section of members of the reserve and hearing their views on the proposed reorganisation at a series of seminars around the country.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied in general that the existing Defence Force regulations, made pursuant to the Defence Act, 1954, are in compliance with the provisions of the Equality Act, 1998. The representative association PDFORRA has recently raised the question of the arrangements governing the deduction for rations, in that married personnel currently enjoy an exemption from the general application of the deduction referred to.</P>
      <P>Rates of allowances, including deductions for rations, come within the scope of representation. The question of the deductions for rations is now being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. The terms of the scheme provide that discussions at conciliation and arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on this issue, except to say that I would anticipate that the matter will be finalised at an early date.</P>

      <P>The investigation by my Department into the incidents which occurred in the early hours of 10 October 2000 on the vessel mv <i>Francoise</i> en route to Brest, and which resulted in the deaths of a number of cattle being transported in cattle trucks on board, is at an advanced stage. The investigation involved inspection by Department personnel and others of the vessel in Brest. In addition, full reports were also sought from both the operators of the vessel and the relevant French authorities, who became involved when the vessel berthed in Brest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> Having examined these reports my Department wrote to the owners of the mv <i>Francoise</i> on 27 October requesting further information and clarification on certain issues. A reply was received on 31 October. Following assessment by my Department and its advisers of this response, a meeting has been arranged with the company which will be held this week and at which the Department will outline its position in relation to the resumption of the carriage of livestock from Ireland on this vessel.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any incident which gives rise to injury to or the death of cattle being transported from Ireland is a cause for concern and warrants thorough investigation with a view to seeking to minimise the possibility of a recurrence of such incidents. Ireland has a good record in this area, not least because of our attention to ensuring that the proper standards are met, and I am determined that this will remain the case.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider the representations made in respect of the suckler quota under the 2001 national reserve scheme for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo who gave up his full-time job in order to enter farming and who is in need of qualification for the scheme.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the year 2001 national reserve. He applied under category D which was reserved for farmers who did not qualify under the priority categories A, B or C because they did not satisfy the age, income, educational qualifications or livestock unit criteria required under those categories. Applicants under category D would only receive allocations if any quota remained after allocations were made to eligible applicants under categories A, B or C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the large number of applicants for reserve quota, 5,336, and the small amount of <Col N="476" /> quota available for distribution, 6,359 premium rights, all the available quota was allocated to 1,058 eligible applicants in the priority categories. Not all eligible applicants under category C received quota.</P>
    <P>There was, therefore, no quota available to allow an allocation to be made to the person named or to any applicant under category D.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 35 cows under the 1999 cattle headage scheme and under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme. These animals were passed at an inspection of his herd on 5 August 1999. However, 32 calves born in 1999 were found to have been brass tagged instead of being tagged with the yellow alpha numeric tags nor were these calves registered under my Department's animal birth registration database in 1999. While at an inspection carried out on 13 January 2000 all of the calves were tagged with the correct tags the person named was informed on 24 January 2000 that as 32 animals which were not the subject of an application for grants were non compliant under EU Regulation 820/97 and as this level of non-compliance exceeded 20%, no payment could issue to him under these schemes. The person named appealed this decision to the independent headage and premia appeals unit where, while the case was fully re-examined, the decision was upheld.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply to Question No. 426 of 3 October 2000, one of the parcels claimed by the person named in his 2000 area aid application overlaps with a parcel of land claimed by another applicant. The person named was contacted in this regard and in his reply clarified the position by including a map showing what the correct position is. This information is now being entered on to the Department's electronic database and payments due under the 2000 cattle headage scheme, 2000 sheep headage scheme and 2000 suckler cow premium scheme will issue to him within the next seven days.</P>

The delay in forwarding the certificates is outside the control of my Department and is due to the failure of the registered owners of the folios involved or of the holders of the land certificates involved to deal promptly with requests from my officials to lodge same with my Department.</P>

      <P>This investigation has been co-ordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which is also charged with formulating the final report. I am advised by the EPA that the report is still under preparation and that its finalisation has been delayed owing to pressure of other work in some of the agencies involved in its completion. My Department has substantially completed its input. I understand that the EPA expects to make the final report available in the first quarter of 2001. It should be noted that three interim reports have been published and these contain the results of a large proportion of the measurements and observations made during the course of the investigations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 and 336 together.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1995, the Leader Programme II has made a substantial impact in rural Ireland. I recognise the contribution of all of the Leader groups, including Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, to the programme of development of our rural areas.</P>
      <P>Leader type activity in the period to 2006 will be delivered through the European Union Leader+ programme together with a mainstream national rural development programme. Funding of over £117 million has been allocated to these two programmes.</P>
      <P>Following a number of information seminars around the country in July this year, my Department invited notices of interest from rural development groups interested in participating in the new programmes. Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann signalled its interest in operating both programmes. Subsequently advertisements inviting interested groups to submit full business plans for either or both programmes were placed in the national and provincial papers and farming press. The closing date for receipt of applications was 27 October 2000 and the group has submitted business plans under both programmes.</P>
      <P>Work on the preparation of the operational programme for Leader+ is at an advanced stage and it is expected that it will be lodged with the European Commission shortly. The programme will also be presented to the special North-South EU programmes body for its endorsement in tandem with the Northern Ireland Leader programme. A period of five months is provided for to facilitate the Commission's consideration of the programme prior to deciding on approval. While I will be pushing for early approval of the programme, it is unlikely that approval will be forthcoming before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The national rural development programme forms part of the regional operational programmes and will be funded under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Given their complementarity, the European Commission has indicated that the approval process for the national rural development programme and the Leader+ programme will take place simultaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An independent consultant will be commissioned to examine all of the applications for assistance under the programmes and make recommendations on selection. The Department will consider this assessment and report to Government who will make the final decision on the selection of groups. The process for selection of groups to operate the new programmes will commence shortly and will proceed contemporaneously with the Com<Col N="479" /> mission's consideration of the programmes. I expect that the decision on the successful groups will follow shortly after the Commission's approval of the programmes.</P>

      <P>No financial penalties have been imposed for failure by my Department to comply with EU directives. Legal proceedings were initiated by the European Commission on 21 May 1999 for failure to give legal effect to Council Directive 96/43/EC (financing of veterinary inspections and controls on live animals and certain animal products) within the prescribed periods. Although a statutory instrument to give legal effect to the directive was subsequently adopted, the Court of Justice deemed that, by failing to adopt the measure within the prescribed periods, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations and was consequently liable for legal costs. Legal proceedings were also initiated by the European Commission on 28 April 2000 for failure to give legal effect to Council Directive 96/24/EC, Council Directive 96/25/EC and Commission Directive 98/67/EC (animal feedingstuffs). The Commission discontinued the proceedings on 11 September 2000 following notification that the necessary statutory instruments had been adopted.

      <P>The social butter scheme, which was fully fundable by the EU, was one of a number of measures used to contribute to balance within the EU dairy market. Ireland was the only member state which operated it. The aid level was progressively reduced from year to year and a decision was taken by the EU Agriculture Council in December 1998 to allow the scheme to operate for one final year.</P>
      <P>The new Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products agreed under Agenda 2000 did not provide for this scheme beyond January 2000. There was, therefore, no legal basis for continuing the scheme beyond that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply to Question No. 75 of 25 May 2000, the Hunting Association of Ireland (HAI) introduced rules and procedures in August 1998 which I have copied to the Deputy. The rules and procedures apply to the affiliate bodies of the HAI, including the Irish Masters of Foxhounds Association, the Irish Masters of Harriers Association and the Irish Foot Harriers Association. The HAI took this action in response to my concern about certain practices associated with fox hunting and following discussion with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of only two complaints having been <Col N="496" /> made and investigated since the rules and procedures were put in place. I have no plans for my Department to investigate such complaints.</P>
    <P>However, I have received specific written assurances from the hunting bodies that they are committed to ensuring compliance with and enforcement of the rules and procedures and to imposing severe sanctions on anyone found not to have complied with them. I have accepted in good faith such assurances and have no reason to believe that any allegations of breaches of the rules and procedures which might be made will not be fully and properly investigated by the HAI in accordance with the principles of natural justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>When criteria for the distribution of ewe premium quota from the 2001 national reserve were being considered, it was estimated that there would be sufficient quota available to satisfy the requirements of all prospective applicants.</P>
      <P>The application procedure for the year 2001 national reserve was, therefore, simplified and no income limits or livestock unit criteria were applied. This simplification resulted in an increase in the number of applicants from 1,854 for the 2000 reserve to 5,676 for the 2001 reserve and 4,806 of these have recently been allocated 188,056 premium rights.</P>
      <P>As was the case in 1999 and 2000, no extra quota rights will be allocated to farmers with commonage land in the six western counties. Individual commonage framework plans for all commonages are being drawn up by my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. When these individual commonage framework plans are implemented, stocking levels on individual REPS plans will be adjusted in accordance with the destocking level, if any, as set out in the relevant commonage framework plan.</P>

      <P>From 1989 until recently, suspect BSE animals have been buried on-farm under licence and under supervision of Department personnel. In the light of the risk to public health caused by the removal of a carcase in County Galway the practice was discontinued from last week. The number of suspected BSE infected animals buried under licence from my Department for each year since 1997 is as follows: 1997, 189; 1998, 185; 1999,197; and 2000, to date, 258.</P>

      <P>Officials from my Department had a constructive meeting with Galway County Council on Tuesday, 31 October to discuss the issue of the burial of BSE suspect animals. The meeting had been arranged several days earlier. In the course of the meeting, the Department indicated that while the burial of such animals was not the Department's preferred option for disposal and ultimate destruction, there had been no alternative in the absence of incineration or other suitable facilities. However, burial had, in all cases, been conducted under licence and veterinary supervision and was subject to a number of safeguard conditions.</P>
      <P>It was also explained that the Department accepted in principle the recommendation of the published BSE scientific advisory committee report that the practice of burying BSE suspects should cease and pointed out that the report also recommended that effective incineration facilities for carcases of BSE suspects should be provided as a matter of priority. There were well publicised difficulties in advancing any incineration project in Ireland and the implementation of this recommendation was, therefore, fraught with difficulties. The efforts which the Department has been making to secure a satisfactory means of disposal and ultimate destruction as an alternative to burial were outlined to the council.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Department expressed an appreciation of the concerns which had been outlined by the council in relation to this matter and both sides agreed to co-operate in addressing concerns specific to County Galway in this particular context.</P>

      <P>The situation is that transfers to provincial locations, such as in this case Sligo, are arranged in accordance with an agreement reached with the staff side at general council under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service. An officer's placing on the transfer list for a particular location is fixed in order of date of receipt of the application in the Department concerned. When the officer's placing on the relevant list is reached, she will at that stage be considered for transfer.</P>

      <P>The former Insurance Corporation of Ireland, now called Icarom plc, was taken over from Allied Irish Banks by the State and placed under High Court administration in 1985. The High Court administration of Icarom plc still continues and is not expected to be completed for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only cost falling on the Exchequer as a result of the funding arrangements for the High Court administration of Icarom arises from an interest-free loan of £32 million which was advanced to Icarom by the Exchequer in 1993 and which is repayable not later than 2012. The cost to the Exchequer of this loan is represented by the interest forgone, which is estimated to <Col N="508" /> amount to £2.1 million annually, based on the yield on 20-year fixed-rate Government stock at the time the loan was advanced. The £32 million interest-free loan was part of additional funding arrangements which were put in place in 1992 and which also involve an additional annual contribution of £8.8 million from Allied Irish Banks for each of the 20 years up to 2012.</P>
    <P>The final cost to the Exchequer cannot be determined until the administration is completed and may be less than the £2.1 million annually referred to above.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer contribution to the funding arrangements for the High Court administration of Icarom plc consisted of a £100 million loan, advanced in 1985 for a term of 15 years, and the £32 million loan which I have outlined above. The Deputy may be aware that the £100 million loan was repaid by Icarom from the company's own resources in September 2000, as scheduled. Under the 1985 funding arrangements AIB and the other banks made an annual contribution of £7 million towards the interest costs of the £100 million loan. The Exchequer did not bear any of the costs of that loan.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to unestablished officers serving in the grades of service officer, service attendant and cleaner. There are 13 such unestablished officers in my Department. Of those 13 officers, seven are unestablished for more than five years, five are unestablished for between two and five years and two are unestablished for less than two years.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that unestablished officers should be given access to established status. However, the whole issue of establishment is dealt with by the Civil Service Commission. Under section 13(1) of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, it is not possible for any officer to become established without entering a competition for establishment held by the Civil Service Commission. The last competition for establishment was held in 1997 under Circular 5/97 &ndash; Competition for Established Appointments. The service requirement for eligibility for that particular competition was two years continued service at service officer, service attendant and cleaner grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competitions for establishment are held from time to time by the Civil Service Commission and I understand that discussions are taking place at <Col N="509" /> central level with the staff side with a view to holding such a competition.</P>

      <P>The rules dealing with starting pay on promotion are set out in Circular 34/77: Starting Pay on Promotion or Establishment. I will make a copy of this document available to the Deputy. I will also provide him with a copy of a subsequent letter to personnel officers of 29 July 1982 which deals with the starting pay of civil servants successful at open competitions for appointment to other Civil Service posts. The executive officer is a grade to which appointments are made from both open and confined competitions.</P>
      <P>The different arrangements which apply in the two competitions can be broadly explained as follows. In confined competitions, the only applicants for a post are serving civil servants and the starting pay on promotion rules apply. In practice this means that successful candidates normally secure an immediate additional increment. In open competitions, serving civil servants compete with members of the public generally and this being the case, while arrangements are put in place to ensure that officers do not lose money, the competition regulations do not provide for starting pay on promotion terms as such provision would give serving civil servants a financial advantage <i>vis-à-vis </i>other successful candidates.</P>

      <P>In the Finance (No 2) Act, 2000, I reduced the stamp duty rates on transfers of residential property at the lower end of the market for owner-occupiers and first time buyers. In particular, the revised regime is structured to facilitate those who are trying to buy their first home and who are faced with particular difficulties in the market at present. However, as the following table shows, owner-occupiers, who are not first-time buyers, also benefit generally from the revised stamp duty rates so that widows-widowers trading down would, in many instances, benefit from a lower rate of stamp duty &ndash; or, at worst, the same rate of duty &ndash; than/as that which prevailed previously. Only where the price of a house is in the <Col N="510" /> price category of £300,001 &ndash; £500,000 would this not be the case. I have no plans, therefore, at present to introduce any further changes to the stamp duty structure.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the context for the recent taxation measures on housing, including these stamp duty measures, is the difficult housing market situation. These market conditions, which are fully elaborated on in the most recent study into the housing market by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, Economic Consultants, required prompt action. In particular there was a pressing need to strengthen the position of first time owner-occupier buyers compared to investors. The third Bacon report pointed to speculative demand which was helping to drive up housing prices. The restructuring of the stamp duty regime to benefit owner-occupiers as against investors is one of the measures designed to help first time and other owner-occupier buyers.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rate payable by investors &ndash; compared with the previous rates that applied &ndash; will of course depend on the price of the house. The Government decided to apply this flat rate of 9% to all non owner-occupier purchasers of new and second hand residential property, irrespective of the value of the property, as it was considered that the previous graduated scale of rates might encourage investments in the lower <Col N="512" /> end of the market. This would not be a desirable development from the point of view of the first time owner-occupier purchaser as it would bring further pressure on prices at the lower end of the market.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty is applied on a once-off basis only. It is applied on a class basis to a range of items, for example, to transfers of Irish shares, to mortgages, to non-life insurance policies as well as to property and is, therefore, not a taxation that lends itself to exemptions on a regional basis. Any attempt to introduce such an exemption would raise equity considerations concerning the tax treatment of individuals in different areas. There is also a serious risk that such an exemption could lead to distortions in the housing market. These could hinder the overall national goal of increasing the supply of new homes, especially to meet the needs of first time buyers who are trying to get a foothold in the housing market.</P>
    <P>I consider that the latest package of measures should assist in restoring balance in the housing market and curbing excessive price increases. This price moderation is in the interests of all in the property sector, whether first time buyer, owner occupier or investor.</P>

      <P>The situation is that the person in question declined an offer of appointment to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in Dublin. Had she accepted the offer, she could have applied for transfer and would have been considered at a later stage when her placing on the relevant transfer list had been reached. It is possible that she may now wish to approach the Civil Service Commission with a view to being offered a further assignment to Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, which is responsible for overall manpower planning in the Civil Service, is keenly conscious of the fact that former civil servants are a potentially important source of recruits to the Civil Service. Consistent with this, the Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for hiring most civil servants, has taken action aimed at specifically targeting former civil servants in terms of recruitment. The key commission initiative in this regard was the announcement in late 1999 of a clerical officer competition confined exclusively to former civil servants to fill vacancies primarily in the Dublin area. This competition attracted 1,116 applications and has yielded several hundred new recruits. In light of this outcome, I expect that the Civil Service Commission will organise further recruitment competitions directed exclusively at former civil servants. These competitions may extend beyond clerical officer to other general service recruitment grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The encouraging response to the special clerical officer competition targeted at former civil servants may be attributed to several factors. One <Col N="514" /> such factor is the facility for those recruited to combine previous and current service for the purpose of attaining the minimum period of service required for eligibility for promotion. The availability of flexible working arrangements in the Civil Service, including the job-sharing, career-break and term-time schemes, is also likely to have proved attractive to many of those who applied.</P>
    <P>My Department is acting to build on these positive features of Civil Service employment so as to further enhance the attractiveness of the Civil Service to potential new recruits, including former civil servants. Subject to talks with the unions, a far-reaching work-sharing initiative, allowing staff to opt for a wide variety of working hours and working weeks is expected to be launched next year. Talks have also commenced with the unions on a proposed reform of the so-called central transfer list arrangements; ultimately this should allow more recruitment into locations outside Dublin, so increasing the opportunities for hiring staff in their preferred locations. The proposed decentralisation programme should also be helpful in this context.</P>
    <P>On the basis of current schemes and planned developments, therefore, there are many positive features of Civil Service employment from the point of view of former civil servants. This fact, along with the proposed holding of further Civil Service Commission competitions confined exclusively to former civil servants, should facilitate the return to the Civil Service of many former civil servants, including those women who were obliged to retire due to the marriage bar.</P>

This is an independent board whose decision is final and consequently I am not in a position to assist a person who has made such an appeal.</P>

In this event, the person concerned is normally notified of the appointment approximately two weeks before the due date.

While not cancelling all the debt, the initiative is intended to reduce it to sustainable levels to enable future growth and to free up resources for poverty reduction.</P>
      <P>In addition to relieving the burden of this multilateral debt, the initiative involves parallel action in respect of outstanding bilateral debt. In the bilateral area a number of major creditors have announced their intentions to go further than is strictly required by the initiative and I have already publicly welcomed this stance. In Ireland's case, the House will be aware that we have provided assistance in grant rather than loan form and that cancellation does not, therefore, arise for us.</P>
      <P>In my speech to the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Prague in September, I voiced my concern about the slow progress of the debt relief process. I also voiced concern at the lack of resources available to these countries for education and health programmes while large amounts must still be paid to creditors. I made special mention of the need for greater speed and more flexibility in implementing the HIPC initiative. I stated quite clearly that it is unacceptable for us to allow a situation where countries that are committed to good governance and tackling poverty reduction are, even after full HIPC relief, still spending a significant proportion of their budget on debt servicing.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that I support greater speed and flexibility in implementing the present initiative. It should not be forgotten that the aim of the HIPC initiative is to reduce indebtedness to sustainable levels and to give the countries concerned an exit from the debt treadmill. Any process which does not accomplish this needs to be further reviewed and specific remedial action taken in the case of identified deficiencies.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the question of IMF programmes in low income countries involves (i) the poverty reduction and growth facility &ndash; PRGF &ndash; which is a specific IMF facility and which replaced ESAF and (ii) the poverty reduction strategy papers which represent a new integrated poverty oriented approach and which involve, in addition, the World Bank group and a number of other players, including the government and civil society of the countries in question.</P>
      <P>Monitoring progress in poverty reduction in the countries concerned is, therefore, wider than simply monitoring programmes related to IMF facilities alone.</P>
      <P>In addition to the ongoing general monitoring of the situation by the institutions concerned and by the EU, I will be drawing specifically on our representatives at both the IMF and the World Bank. I am also availing of the expertise and feedback available through the Department of Foreign Affairs who have personnel working on the ground in many of the least developed, and particularly in our priority countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, I welcome contributions and feedback from the NGO community in this country, many of whom also have a presence on the ground in these countries.</P>

The outcome of this review, in which class sizes, student attendance and teacher requirements were considerations, was a decision to concentrate resources on French and German, in line with the centre's objective of equipping civil servants to operate more effectively in EU fora.

      <P>The Mount Street crèche is run by the Civil Service Crèche Co-operative Limited.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the problems that the closure of the crèche has caused parents. My Department is working very closely with the Civil Service Crèche Co-operative to ensure the Mount Street crèche re-opens as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The crèche had been operated under licence by a manager appointed by the co-operative. However, in September the co-operative decided to allow the licence to expire and to appoint a new manager. The crèche closed on 15 September. In advance of the closure the co-operative entered into discussions with a private crèche management company with a view to engaging it to run the Mount Street crèche.</P>
      <P>Following the closure of the crèche, an inspection of the premises by the Eastern Health Board revealed that the premises were below mandatory standards. The Office of Public Works undertook the refurbishment work which it expects to complete by early November. I understand that the new crèche management company will then require some time to install childcare equipment and recruit staff.</P>
      <P>I expect that the crèche will reopen shortly with facilities fully in compliance with current health board regulations. My Department is discussing future management arrangements with the Civil Service Crèche Co-operative.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 498 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy and physiotherapy services, is the responsibility of the relevant health board. Accordingly, the Deputy's questions have been referred to the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board, with <Col N="524" /> a request that she examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including speech and language therapists. Among the issues examined by this group were the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the workforce planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established, will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, I have secured a total of 52 extra places for the training of physiotherapists, five additional places for the training of occupational therapists and three in the area of speech and language therapy, all available from October 2000.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a fast-track physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. The first graduates from these programmes should be available in 2003.</P>
    <P>The possibility of establishing a similar course for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

An additional three places were secured, which brings to 107 the number undergoing training at the moment.</P>
      <P>The salary scale for speech and language therapists is from £20,118 to £26,274, with a long service increment after three years at the maximum of the scale, bringing the scale to £26,801. On promotion to senior therapist, a therapist's salary rises by £4,200 and on promotion to manager, by a further £4,200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a range of substances used in the food manufacturing process. There are strict controls on the utilisation of additives, colourings, flavourings and preservatives in this process. Different people may be <Col N="526" /> sensitive to foods which are in everyday use, for example, flour, nuts, mushrooms and seafood.</P>
      <P>A food allergy is an immune response to a food, or a substance in a food, present either naturally, by contamination or by processing, cooking or digestion. Allergic reaction symptoms range from a short-lived discomfort to anaphylactic shock and, in some cases, death. In Ireland it has been estimated that the prevalence of allergies in the population is 3% &ndash; National Infant Feeding Policy, Food Safety Authority of Ireland, 1999. Most adverse reactions to foods are not allergies but some other type of food sensitivity such as food intolerance or food idiosyncrasy.</P>
      <P>Over 170 foods have been documented in the scientific literature as causing allergic reactions. The known major serious allergens &ndash; MSAs &ndash; that can be dealt with effectively are milk, eggs, soy, wheat, peanuts, shellfish, fruits, tree nuts, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, cottonseeds &ndash; meal, not oil &ndash; poppy seeds, molluscs, beans other than green beans, peas and lentils. Additionally, unrefined peanut oil, tartrazine, sulphites and latex should also be considered MSAs.</P>
      <P>Food manufacturers should take all precautions to deal effectively with avoidable MSAs and issue warnings on labels where the presence of any MSA is unavoidable. All precautions should be taken to prevent the presence of allergens where possible and the &ldquo;may contain allergen name&rdquo; label should only then be used where contamination is unavoidable.</P>
      <P>Dealing effectively with avoidable MSAs requires a comprehensive and effective hazard analysis and critical control point system &ndash; HACCP. The Hygiene of Foodstuffs Regulations &ndash; S.I. No. 165 of 2000 &ndash; requires manufacturers to identify the critical steps in their processes that ensure food safety by applying the principles of HACCP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I have recently announced a £25 million investment package to help alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector over the winter period.</P>
      <P>The investment package is being targeted at a number of key areas including approval to recruit 25 additional accident and emergency consultants; approval to recruit 15 additional consultant anaesthetists; immediate contracting of at least 500 additional nursing home places for patients who have completed the acute phase of treatment; provision of additional aids and supports for older persons; development of a new acute assessment unit at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and the provision of a number of minor injury and respiratory units in the eastern region.</P>
      <P>Hospitals providing accident and emergency services experience a seasonal increase in activity and a surge in admissions during the winter months. This impacts significantly on the capacity of the acute hospital sector to provide sufficient acute beds for patients requiring admission. The appointment of additional consultants is designed to ensure early clinical intervention at a senior level, reduce waiting times and thus improve patient access.</P>
      <P>A major factor affecting the ability of hospitals to provide beds for patients over the winter period is the high number of acute beds which are inappropriately occupied by patients who have completed the acute phase of their illness. Many of these patients are elderly and require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment. The provision of additional nursing home places will help to reduce the effect of inappropriately placed patients on the acute hospital system.</P>
      <P>The provision of medical appliances and aids is essential in facilitating the discharge of older persons from hospital and in reducing the level of hospital re-admissions. Additional funding is being provided as part of the investment package for the provision of a range of supports, including walking aids, wheelchairs and special beds.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have approved a new development at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, which involves the provision of a new acute assessment unit for patients. The new unit will be located adjacent to the hospital's accident and emergency department and will provide for speedier consultant interaction and improved services for patients. It is anticipated that this will reduce the number of investigations as earlier intervention and diagnosis at more senior appropriate clinical level for patients will result in a shorter average length of stay for patients and more efficient use of the hospital beds.</P>

      <P>At present there are in excess of 400 asylum seekers located in five towns throughout County Kerry. The majority of these asylum seekers have been assigned to individual general practitioners who are providing primary health care services. The board is experiencing difficulties in a number of locations where GPs have refused to accept additional asylum seekers on their panel.</P>
      <P>The board has entered into detailed negotiations with these general practitioners and the Irish Medical Organisation. The board is at present finalising revised arrangements for the provision of primary care services to asylum seekers through general practitioners and it is expected that these revised procedures will enable a full primary care service to be delivered to asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>The Infectious Disease Regulations, 1981, and subsequent amendments provide the basis for the reporting of infectious diseases in Ireland. Under the regulations a medical practitioner must notify in writing the appropriate health board of each case of infectious disease as soon as he or she becomes aware of or suspects such a case. On a weekly basis each health board furnishes to the National Disease Surveillance Centre a return of the cases of infectious diseases notified in its functional area.</P>
      <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre &ndash; NDSC &ndash; was established in 1998 and its principal function is the surveillance of communicable diseases. Its other functions include the provision of advice to my Department on a range of infectious disease issues, collaboration with and supporting the health boards in the control of infectious disease, the development of guidelines and protocols and undertaking research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the Infectious Disease Regu<Col N="534" /> lations, 1981, was initiated by my Department in 1999 and the advice of the NDSC has been sought on a number of issues, including the range of diseases which are statutorily notifiable. My Department will consider the NDSC's recommendations when they are received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1999 the Government decided that the question of introducing a no fault compensation scheme for brain damaged infants should be examined in the context of Irish law. My Department has appointed Marsh Ireland as its advisers on the actuarial basis for such a scheme as well as to advise on the proposed introduction of enterprise liability as the future basis for indemnifying doctors. I also hope to be able to announce shortly the appointment of an advisory group to look at the no fault issue.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a no fault scheme raises complex medical and legal issues. Until I receive the report of the advisory group, I cannot anticipate the nature or the extent of the legislation which would be required to give effect to a no fault scheme, if the advisory group were to recommend that such a scheme was feasible in Ireland. For the same reason I cannot give a time scale for the introduction of any scheme.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy, to persons with a physical or sensory disability is the responsibility of the relevant health board. <Col N="535" /> Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy, needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including speech and language therapists. Among the issues examined by this group were the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million.</P>
      <P>Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the workforce planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established, will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, I have secured a total of 52 extra places for the training of physiotherapists, five additional places for the training of occupational therapists and three in the area of speech and language therapy, all available from October 2000. The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a &lsquo;fast-track' physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. The first graduates from these programmes should be available in 2003.</P>
      <P>The possibility of establishing a similar course for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

Their public hospital practice, including the treatment of private patients, will be covered by the proposed medical indemnity scheme. They will remain responsible for indemnifying themselves in respect of their off-site private practice.</P>
      <P>The proposed scheme will not cover consultants who are in full-time private practice. However, it is not the intention that the proposed changes in the indemnity arrangements for the public hospital system should have any adverse effect on the cost of indemnity for consultants in the private sector.</P>

      <P>The capitation system for the GMS scheme was introduced in 1989 after a review of the operation of the scheme in the mid-1980s. Initially, the scheme had been on a fee per item basis but the evidence available at the time of the review and subsequently indicates that the movement from a fee per item to a capitation based system is a most positive one. From a patient perspective, clinical care is unaffected as it remains solely the responsibility of the general practitioner. From the viewpoint of the individual GMS scheme general practitioner, he or she is able to estimate with a greater degree of accuracy his or her likely income for the year, which makes planning for personal and professional affairs easier, and the State is also better positioned to not only estimate projected costs but also to exercise control over their potential escalation.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> Under the eligibility arrangements which were introduced in 1991, beds in public hospitals are formally designated as public, private or non-designated. The Health Service (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991, which were introduced pursuant to the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, state that a hospital providing services under sections 52 and 55 of the Health Act, 1970, shall designate every bed, other than non-designated beds, as a designated public bed or a designated private bed. The category non-designated beds refers to beds such as intensive care beds which it was not considered appropriate to designate as public or private.</P>
    <P>In its recently published report, &ldquo;Private Practice in Irish Public Hospitals&rdquo;, the ESRI found that about 20% of in-patient beds in acute public hospitals are currently designated as being for private patient use. The report shows that, of the total number of public bed days used, approximately 6% were used by private patients and about 23% of all in-patient bed-days spent by private patients in public hospitals were in beds designated as public. In addition, the report also shows that there is a crossover of slightly lower absolute volume in the other direction, that is, of public patients into private beds. The authors suggest that improvements to the reporting and monitoring of the arrangements could be piloted in hospitals where &ldquo;crossover&rdquo; is most prevalent.</P>
    <P>The report states that the main factor identified by hospital management as leading to private patients being accommodated in public beds was admission through accident and emergency departments. This largely reflects the need to accommodate patients in the most appropriate available bed irrespective of its designation. Nonetheless, the study shows that the throughput of patients is consistent with public/private bed designations. The public private mix in public hospitals is under continual assessment by my Department to ensure that the best possible service is available to all patients but particularly the public patient. This assessment includes monitoring of the bed designation system whereby the approval of the Minister for Health and Children must be obtained by public agencies for any increase in the designation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that I have initiated a study of bed capacity in response to commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This study is examining both acute and non-acute bed numbers and will deal with issues relating to bed numbers throughout the public system.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the occupancy of the beds referred to above is currently being compiled by my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon it is finalised.</P>

      <P>I understand from the South Eastern Health Board that the board is satisfied that the facts were correct in the reply issued to Parliamentary Question No. 574. The Deputy did not ask for the status of the patient, that is, public or private. The consultant's common contract allows for patients to be seen as public or private patients and it is a matter for patients which option to choose. The person in this case chose to be treated privately and was admitted under the care of an ophthalmic surgeon on 10 September 2000.</P>

    <P>Prior to the introduction of the Registration of Births Act, 1996, the particulars required by law to be recorded in a register of births did not include a particular surname for a child. Accordingly, when a certified copy of the entry in the register of births was issued in respect of a child whose birth had been re-registered under the provisions of the Legitimacy Act, 1931, it stated, <i>inter alia,</i> the forename of the child, the name and surname of the father, the name, surname and maiden surname of the mother.</P>
    <P>The schedule of the Registration of Births Act, 1996, set out the particulars to be registered in respect of the birth of a child, registered on or <Col N="542" /> after 1 October 1997, and these include a forename(s) and surname for a child. Where a surname assigned to a child is recorded in the register of births, that surname is included in any certificate issued in respect of that entry. Section 1(4) of the Act provides where the birth of a child is being re-registered, after the commencement of the Act, and the birth has previously been registered so as to record a surname of the child, the surname to be recorded for the child on re-registration is that which appeared in the original entry.</P>
    <P>The future development of the registration service is being considered in the context of the joint initiative being undertaken by my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to identify and implement the changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events. The review encompasses the structure of registration on a national basis as well as the Acts relating to the registration of vital events. As part of the review process, it is planned to publish a consultation document in December 2000 on the future development of the registration service and to obtain the views of all interested parties. The issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in the context of the review of the legislation.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the South Eastern Health Board has proposed to reduce the number of gynaecological beds in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, from 14 to eight from 1 November 2000 which will severely curtail gynaecological services; and if he will intervene and prevent this policy from being implemented.</Quest>

      <P>The provision of services at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board document, Shaping the Future of the Kilkenny Hospital System, is the blueprint for the development of St. <Col N="543" /> Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny as a comprehensive, integrated, quality and efficient hospital, capable of meeting the challenges of the times in a competent and humane manner. The target date set for rationalisation of all hospital services in Kilkenny city into an interactive hospital complex is 2002.</P>
    <P>This development plan contains proposals to enhance existing services on the St. Luke's site including general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics, gynaecology, accident and emergency and diagnostic services. It proposes to provide all hospital services on one site in a way that combines ease of access to the public with a cost effective service. The development plans take account of national policy which is to have a strong network of local and general hospitals which serve defined catchment hospital services for general, medical and surgical facilities.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of these developments the hospital has a limited capacity to respond internally to the increase in demands presented due to its physical design and structure and lack of access to alternatives to in-patient services.</P>
    <P>The following measures are proposed to be implemented with a view to redressing the difficulties experienced in the hospital: development of a four bed medical assessment/observation unit; redesignation of bed allocation between specialties in the hospital &ndash; medical, surgical and gynaecology including the redesignation of four gynaecological beds as surgical beds; provision of enhanced community supports including home help, home care and direct access to convalescent care in private nursing homes to facilitate early discharge and development of the role of the bed management group at consultant level to review on a scheduled basis the impact of these measures. I trust the Deputy will understand why the board has had to take a range of measures to meet the exigencies of the current situation and in the interests of the future development of the hospital.</P>
    <P>The board has assured me that it recognises there is a need to provide for the ongoing monitoring of activity in St. Luke's Hospital and the impact of these measures on bed management and utilisation in the hospital.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 3 October 2000 on this issue. There is no correct caesarean section rate and very many reasons influence what a hospitals caesarean section rate may be. As with all medical interventions, caesarean sections should only be undertaken for sound clinical reasons in the interest of both mothers and babies. My Department's chief medical officer has sought the views of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists who are the organisation with professional responsibility for standards in this area. On receipt of their reply, the chief medical officer will consider how best this issue can be addressed.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there has been an increase in the number of teenagers with type two diabetes, a condition which is attributable to sedentary lifestyles and lower levels of physical activity; and the way in which he will deal with this issue.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is concern throughout the developed world about the increase in adult onset &ndash; type two &ndash; diabetes mellitus. The risk of this type of diabetes is increased in those who are overweight or <Col N="549" /> obese. Diabetes is of concern because it carries a greatly increased risk of heart disease and stroke. In addition to treatment for any symptoms of diabetes, these patients benefit from attention to lifestyle and to risk factors for heart disease. This includes avoidance of smoking, treatment of raised blood pressure and raised levels of cholesterol in the blood, as well as weight reduction and regular physical activity.</P>
      <P>From a public health perspective, it is desirable to prevent the onset of this type of diabetes, by reducing the extent to which people gain weight as they grow older. This starts with attention to eating and physical activity habits among young people.</P>
      <P>The survey of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition &ndash; SLÁN &ndash; and Irish health behaviour in school-aged children &ndash; HBSC &ndash; survey provides data on the weight and height of young people as well as their level of physical activity. The results show that 8% of all children reported being on a weight reducing diet and an additional 23% reported that they needed to lose weight. While two thirds of younger boys reported participating in vigorous exercise four or more times a week this had declined to just over half of all boys in all social classes in the 15-17 year age group. A similar pattern was observed with girls, but in the 15-17 year age group only one in four reported this level of activity.</P>
      <P>The strategic aim of the new health promotion strategy in relation to exercise is to increase participation in regular, moderate physical activity. Health promotion initiatives targeting a reduction in heart related disease is a central focus of &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo;; the report of the cardiovascular health strategy group. In this regard, awareness campaigns highlighting the lifestyle risk factors associated with heart related diseases, as well as other diseases, and associated activities are being undertaken nationwide.</P>
      <P>Healthy eating, regular physical activity and not smoking are the three main things young people can do to reduce their cardiovascular risk profile. In addition, habits learned at a young age provide a basis for a healthy adulthood. This includes the prevention of weight gain and the associated risks of developing type two diabetes when older.</P>

Health promotion initiatives targeting the reduction in heart related disease are a central focus of the implementation of the report.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>A major agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation was concluded last year on dispensing. The purpose of that agreement is to introduce new procedures and arrangements for dispensing doctors in the GMS scheme, including a wholly computerised records and management system. Given the nature and extent of the change, the date of 1 January 2001 was chosen for full implementation. The choice of that date had regard to the need to first develop the new software, then commence the pilot, then initiate training and, finally, roll out the new computerised systems. A new manual of best dispensing practice was also to be prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A working group, comprising representatives from my Department, the GMS Payments Board and the IMO has been working to progress this project towards full implementation. However, the small size of the total dispensing market made the development of the relevant software unattractive to a number of commercial suppliers and <Col N="551" /> this contributed to a delay in the pilots but this issue has now been resolved. Notwithstanding this, other preparatory work continues to progress towards full implementation, both nationally and at practice level, and accordingly those doctors participating in the new arrangements are being paid under the terms of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with the development of the software may see some slight slippage in the introduction of the wholly computerised procedures but that is only one aspect of the new arrangements and procedures which have generally progressed in a timely fashion.</P>

      <P>There are a range of financial incentives available under the GMS scheme to assist general practitioners to engage practice support staff. Many general practitioners have availed of these incentives to provide administrative and other supports within their practices. I am not aware that doctors have experienced particular problems with staffing and would take this opportunity to encourage then to use the available financial supports to meaningfully assist with the recruitment of the relevant staff.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of information technology and the general practitioner, the national general practice information technology group, established by my Department and having significant GP membership, launched this year the first ever national training programme in information technology for GMS scheme and non-GMS scheme general practitioners. The programme is being delivered for the group by the Irish College of General Practitioners.</P>
      <P>The national GPIT group is also working on a number of other issues relating to information technology in general practice which are relevant not only to actual practice and clinical management but also to facilitating electronic exchanges between general practice and other healthcare areas. The group will continue to receive funding from my Department to support its work to make greater use of information technology in general practice a reality. Further, any recommendations on IT and general practice emerging from the review of general practitioner services currently being undertaken by the health boards will be carefully considered in the context of the overall structural development of general practice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department have discussed the accreditation process with the Medical Council. I understand that the Medical Council has issued questionnaires to all of the hospitals in the country to ascertain if the hospitals are providing the appropriate level of training for the junior hospital doctors in their employ. For a hospital to <Col N="556" /> receive recognition from the Medical Council for temporary registration of non-consultant hospital doctors it must fulfil certain criteria relating to the training for NCHDs. The Medical Council has visited some hospitals, and intends to visit all of the hospitals in the country, to ensure that the hospitals are providing the appropriate level of training required. The Medical Council then issues a report to the hospital outlining any problems it sees with the training provided by the hospital. The hospital must then respond to the comments of the Medical Council within a specified time and if no response is given, or the response is deemed inadequate, then the Medical Council can refuse to recognise this hospital for temporary registration. However, the hospital can reapply for temporary registration as soon as it meets the criteria laid down by the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council has not given me a list of the hospitals who have had temporary registration withdrawn. I understand from the Medical Council that some of these hospitals do not have NCHDs on their staff and others have never been approved for postgraduate or specialist training. The Medical Council has informed me that it has been in contact with these hospitals about regaining-obtaining recognition for temporary registration of NCHDs if they so wish. I understand that several hospitals have indicated that they do not intend to pursue the matter.  </P>

    <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the total number of public hospital beds for each of the years in question. The data requested by the Deputy are set out in the following table. For the years 1970, 1980 and 1990 the figures refer to the total in-patient bed complement for all publicly-funded acute hospitals at 31 December for the given year. Since 1993 a bed designation exercise has been in operation under which beds in public hospitals are formally designated as public, private or non-designated on 1 January each year. In the year 2000, beds have been designated as follows: 9,030 public, 2,528 private and 769 non-<Col N="557" /> designated. The total figure and population-based rate is show in the table below.</P>

    <P>I outlined the position in relation to the particular advertisement referred to in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 306, and replied to on Tuesday, 24 October 2000. I have since been informed by the Irish Medicines Board that the editor of the publication concerned has apologised for the breach of the regulations in pub<Col N="558" /> lishing the advertisement, which had been accepted in error from a sister publication in the UK. The Irish Medicines Board has been assured that the law, and editorial policy not to publish advertisements for the sale of medicines by mail order, will be adhered to by the publishers in future. The Irish Medicines Board will continue to liaise with the UK Medicines Control Agency on matters of this nature.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 491 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of falling numbers of general practitioners. In the specific context of doctors in the GMS scheme, the numbers are actually increasing. Currently, the number of agreements with doctors under the GMS scheme is 1,757 as compared with 1,679 at end December 1999, which was itself up on 1,629 from the previous year. Indeed, these figures do not even give the full picture to the extent that many contracted practitioners also retain assistants who share in the work of the practices including the provision of services to GMS scheme patients. Moreover, there are other non-GMS scheme doctors holding other contracts from the State to provide services under other specific schemes, such as the primary childhood immunisation scheme.</P>
      <P>I should also state that the Irish College of General Practitioners received 180 applications for 54 places on the GP vocational training programme this year which indicates a continuing significant interest in this area among medical graduates and my Department is also looking at the possibility of increasing the existing number of GP trainee positions.</P>
      <P>Further, the issue of general practice manpower requirements will be one of the areas which will be fully, and strategically, considered in the light of the review of general practice being undertaken by the health board chief executive officers which I expect to be completed shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Section 13 <Col N="561" /> of the regulations states that &ldquo;a health board may impute an annual income equivalent to 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of the person, if it was not occupied immediately prior to or at the time of the application by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than twenty one years or in full time education or a relative in receipt of the Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance, Blind Person's Pension, Disability Benefit, Invalidity Pension or Old Age Non-Contributory Pension.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 10.4 of the regulations sets out the level of abatement whereby a health board, in calculating the amount of subvention to be paid to a person, may abate the maximum rate appropriate to that person's level of dependency by the amount which that person's means exceeds the rate of the old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the regulations set out an exclusion whereby a health board may refuse to pay a subvention to a person if his or her principal residence is valued at £75,000 or more and is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind person's pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension and the person's income is greater than £5,000 per annum. My Department is currently examining a number of aspects of the nursing home regulations including a review of the value of the principal residence for the purposes of the exclusion clause.</P>
      <P>Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.</P>

In addition, home helps will, from 1 January 2001, be paid at the group 1 rates. This is equivalent to between £6.54 and £6.90 per hour, and represents a substantial increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The motorised transport grant scheme provides assistance to eligible people with disabilities who need a car to gain or retain employment. In certain cases it may also be granted to disabled persons living in very isolated circumstances who <Col N="564" /> have serious transport problems. The grant is intended as a contribution towards the purchase or adaptation of motorised transport. Payment of the grant is subject to a means test. At present the maximum grant available is £3,171. The assessment of entitlement to a motorised transport grant in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I have had inquiries made of the Western Health Board concerning this matter and I understand that the applicant meets the criteria for the grant. I have also been informed that the board has advised the applicant that his application will be processed on production of an invoice for the purchase of the vehicle and a current driving licence.</P>
      <P>In addition to the motorised transport grant scheme, there exists a scheme drawn up by the Minister for Finance under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. Under these regulations severely and permanently disabled persons may be entitled to repayment of vehicle registration tax and value added tax paid on specially constructed or adapted vehicles. Excise duty paid on fuel used in such vehicles may also be repaid, subject to certain limits and conditions. These regulations also provide for relief from motor tax.</P>
      <P>To qualify, a person's disability must conform to the medical criteria as specified in the above regulations which are not set by the Department of Health and Children. The senior area medical officer for the relevant health board area will issue a primary medical certificate if he-she is satisfied that the applicant fulfils the medical criteria set out in the Department of Finance's Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. This role is to assist the operation of the Revenue scheme.</P>
      <P>Further details of this scheme and an application form may be obtained from the Disabled Drivers Section, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Coolshannagh, Monaghan, County Monaghan which operates under the aegis of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the level of medical attention required by Down's syndrome persons; if he will ensure that each Down's syndrome person is entitled to a medical card personally by right; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24226/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of medical attention required by persons with Down's syndrome is taken into account when deciding an individual's entitlement to a medical card. However, entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of <Col N="565" /> eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to extend the medical card scheme to all persons with Down's Syndrome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government made a total of £4 million available in May 1999, on a full year basis, to allow for the establishment of a counselling service for those who were abused while in care and £200,000 of this was set aside for central developments, including the funding of support groups. Allocations to these <Col N="566" /> groups are being finalised at present and I will write to the Deputy shortly setting out the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the above, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Ministers or Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means. I should point out, however, that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin is the national paediatric cardiac centre and my Department has been aware that there has been concern over waiting times for children in this speciality. The development of this speciality at the hospital has been the subject of discussions with my Department and the hospital for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is in a position to respond to the need for their cardiology/cardiac surgery services. In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department has sanctioned a major theatre development at the hospital. This development, when completed, will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40 per cent on its existing capacity. <Col N="567" /> This project is expected to cost in the region of £20 million. In addition, my Department has approved the appointment of an additional consultant cardiothoracic surgeon who I understand commenced duty at the hospital in August of this year.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the implementation of the above measures will enable Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children to provide enhanced cardiac surgery services for all children within the country.</P>

      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin is the national paediatric cardiac centre. I am committed to ensuring that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is in a position to respond to the demand for its cardiology-cardiac surgery services. It was in this context that my Department sanctioned a major theatre development at the hospital. This theatre development, when completed, will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40 per cent on its existing capacity.</P>
      <P>There is no delay with the development. I am advised that it is progressing on schedule and that tenders for the development will issue in January 2001 with commencement of work on site in the spring of 2001.</P>
      <P>With regard to the existing theatre facilities at the hospital, I am advised that one theatre is not in operation at the present time. The closure of the theatre is attributed by the hospital to nursing staff vacancies which they are endeavouring to resolve by means of a major nursing recruitment initiative abroad, mainly in the Middle East. Nothwithstanding the closure of the theatre for the reason outlined, the hospital is managing the situation and I am assured that theatre activity has not suffered significantly as a consequence of this closure.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there has been concern over waiting times in this speciality. Some of the measures cited by the hospital as contributing to the increasing pressure on this service were the lack of theatre space and ICU beds, shortage of ICU trained nurses and advances in surgical and interventional techniques available </P>
      <P>In December 1997 the hospital was allocated a sum of £500,00 from the cardiac waiting list initiative to implement measures aimed at reducing pressures in the most effective and appropriate manner. In 1998, 1999 and 2000 under the same initiative the hospital was allocated sums of £878,550, £679,000 and £700,000 respectively. The funding has been used for a number of measures aimed at reducing waiting times in this specialty. These include the provision of an additional four ICU beds, the implementation of a training programme for ICU nurses and the purchase of cardiac procedures from appropriate UK paediatric hospitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department issued a questionnaire on tracing and reunion services to health boards in the spring of this year. Based on the information returned, it is estimated that in the year 1999 there were more than 100 social workers <Col N="574" /> involved, to varying degrees, in the provision of tracing and reunion services in the health boards. Social workers in the health boards do not work exclusively on tracing and reunion. The tracing and reunion service is usually encompassed within their overall caseload which may include, for example, domestic and intercountry adoption, fostering and in some cases child protection work. In terms of whole time equivalent posts it is estimated that approximately ten social workers were engaged in this work in the health boards. The breakdown is outlined in Table 1 below:</P>

    <P>* The NWHB sub-contracts its tracing work to the voluntary adoption agencies in its functional area</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>In the Adoption Board there is currently one whole time equivalent post, two part-time posts, dedicated exclusively to tracing and reunion. A further six social workers and a senior worker also carry a tracing caseload along with their other duties.</P>
    <P>The number of tracing and reunion requests received by the health boards, the registered adoption agencies and the Adoption Board and the waiting time for commencement of case is outlined in Table 2 below. Of the tracing and reunion requests received by health boards and registered adoption societies last year over 60 per cent were received by the registered adoption societies and health boards received approximately 40 per cent. The Deputy should note that there is an overlap between the number of tracing and reunion requests received by the health boards-registered adoption agencies and the Adoption Board because requests received by the Adoption Board are referred to the relevant health board/registered adoption agency except in cases where there was no agency involved in the adoption. In addition, it is often necessary for the Adoption Board and the health boards-registered adoption agencies to share information to complete a trace which means that both are making a contribution to the tracing and reunion request.</P>

    <P>The Deputy should note that Barnardos and other voluntary groups working in the area of adoption also provide an adoption advice service for those wishing to trace and be reunited with a blood relative. Earlier this year a number of these groups received once-off funding for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that work is nearing completion in the Department's child care legislation unit on the preparation of legislation in the very complex area of Adoption Information, post-adoption contact and Associated Issues. The scheme of a Bill will be circulated to relevant Government Departments for their observations in the very near future. This legislation will provide for, amongst other issues, the regulation and funding of tracing and reunion services.</P>

      <P>While my Department has allocated some specific funding in recent years to all health boards, including the South Eastern Health Board, to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities or <Col N="577" /> other special needs, it is a matter for the individual boards, in the first instance, to identify and prioritise the distribution of funding between the various support services required by both children and adults with disabilities or special needs.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of routine psychological assessments for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science. Pending the development of a more comprehensive level of services by that Department, health boards have endeavoured to assist with the assessment of children with educational needs, such as those with dyslexia, but the primary concern of the health funded psychological services is to provide assessment and therapeutic treatment to children, adolescents and their families who present with a wide range of emotional, behavioural and psychological difficulties and development delay.</P>
      <P>With reference to the further enhancement of the health funded assessment services, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the ongoing expansion of the support services required by children with disabilities and other special needs. As the Estimates discussions in relation to 2001 are still under way, I am not yet in a position to comment on any specific plans for the health services for next year.</P>

When a woman chooses to avail of services under this scheme she is under the care of both a general practitioner of her choice and a hospital obstetrician. Any special medical care which may be required is provided in the context of this scheme. Furthermore, one of the aims of the scheme is that the requirements of women with special needs are recognised and dealt with as flexibly as possible.</P>

Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including occupational therapists. Among the issues examined by this group were the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the workforce planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and <Col N="581" /> the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, I have secured a total of 52 extra places for the training of physiotherapists, five additional places for the training of occupational therapists and three in the area of speech and language therapy, all available from October 2000.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a &ldquo;fast-track&rdquo; physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. The first graduates from these programmes should be available in 2003.</P>
    <P>The possibility of establishing a similar course for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the long-term illness (LTI) scheme drugs and medicines are provided, free of charge, for the treatment of certain conditions, including epilepsy. The patient concerned receives medication for the treatment of epilepsy. As Lipostat has been prescribed for the treatment of another condition, not linked to epilepsy and not included in the schedule of illnesses covered by the long-term illness scheme it is not, therefore, eligible for reimbursement in the case of this patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be <Col N="582" /> entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. The Deputy will wish to know that the Government decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement was introduced over a three year period, which began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for persons over 70 years which were already higher than the normal guidelines have been increased by two thirds in the past two years and the balance will be added in 2001.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the LTI scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS and drug refund scheme, DRS. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure have been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. In October 1999, the faculty of public health medicine of The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. All the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required <Col N="583" /> under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I considered it timely to set up a forum on fluoridation with terms of reference as follows: to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area; and to report and to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion. Environmental interests have been invited but so far have declined. The forum will invite submissions from the public. The forum has already met on a number of occasions under the chairmanship of Professor Pat Fottrell. I hope to have an interim report from the forum by the end of this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I feel that some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard I established an advisory group, chaired by Professor <Col N="584" /> Niall O'Higgins, St. Vincent's Hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services.

      <P>The former Eastern Health Board conducted a review of service needs for older people in its ten year action plan for services for older people 1999-2008. The plan recommended the development of 29 community nursing units of 50 beds each throughout the region.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the board's report, a number of service developments have been implemented including: the provision of 400 beds in community units, in patient facilities and convalescent facilities; funding of approximately 300 additional contract beds; increased funding for nursing home subventions; provision of 40 step-down beds attached to the acute general hospitals; creation of 140 day care places; appointment of two additional consultant physicians in medicine for older people; a range of measures to improve the care of older people in their home and in the community, including the appointment of community support teams and nutritional advisers; increasing the rates of pay for home helps; and provision of additional staff in voluntary care organisations including and establishment of carers groups.</P>
      <P>In addition, community nursing units are currently under construction at Maynooth and Lusk while a unit at Leopardstown Park Hospital is due to commence construction in the summer of 2001. Further units are at various stages of planning.</P>
      <P>In the light of the new organisational structures and projected demographic changes, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, is planning to conduct a review of current service provision and future needs. These requirements will be discussed with my Department as part of the overall development of services for older people.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> All families wishing to be considered suitable for foster placements must apply formally and undergo an assessment by the health board in accordance with the regulations. Children are placed with particular families, based on their needs and the capability of the foster family to provide care for children placed with them.</P>
    <P>In general, where four or more children are placed with the one family, it would be on an emergency basis and only then where it is necessary in order to keep sibling groups together or to provide short-term respite care. In many of these cases the children are placed with relatives who have applied under the foster care scheme. Such placements tend to be for short periods only until a more suitable placement is found or the children return to their own home. The health boards have assured the Department that all children who are currently placed in a multiple fostering situation are considered to be appropriately placed for their immediate needs.</P>
    <P>Foster care is the main form of alternative care provided by the health boards and has expanded and developed over the last decade in line with the general child protection and welfare service. While the services have developed there has been an increased level of demand, resulting in an increasing level of pressure on the service. As the Deputy is aware a working group on foster care has been examining all issues in relation to foster care and is due to report shortly. I will examine the recommendations of the report when it is published.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that certain genetic groups are more susceptible to new variant CJD; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there is a genetic predisposition to new variant CJD, VCJD. Codon 129 has a gene which gives rise to three genetic possibilities &ndash; homozygous for valine, heterozygous for methionine valine and homozygous for methionine. To date, only people who have been homozygous for methionine have contracted VCJD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last two weeks I have approved funding for the purchase and installation of specialised equipment at the Irish national CJD surveillance centre at Beaumont Hospital. This <Col N="591" /> equipment will assist in determining the prevalence of the three genetic types in question within the Irish population.</P>

      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 332 of 21 March 2000, the reason he stated there was no chromium contained in hydrofluosilicic acid.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In my response to the Deputy's parliamentary question of 21 March 2000 I stated that chromium was not present in the hydrofluosilicic acid used for the fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
      <P>My reply was based on an independent laboratory analysis of hydrofluosilicic acid carried out for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the contract holder for the supply of the substance. However, this analysis did not, apparently, include analysis for the presence of chromium. Accordingly, the laboratory report did not list the presence of chromium and my officials concluded from this report that chromium was not present. If an analysis had been conducted for chromium it is possible that trace levels of the substance might have been found. These levels would be insignificant to public health. I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority to extend the range of substances tested for in the course of routine independent laboratory analysis to include chromium.</P>
      <P>I apologise to the Deputy for the unsatisfactory nature of the previous reply and I trust that I have now clarified the position to the satisfaction of the Deputy and the House.</P>

The monitoring of the quality of public water supplies for possible contamination from whatever source is a function of the local authorities. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has stated that no evidence has been produced which indicates that the burial of any animals has adversely affected a local water supply. Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development were in contact with senior officials from Galway County Council regarding the concerns which have been raised. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has stated that the burial of BSE suspect animals will cease and interim arrangements are being put in place involving retention of the carcasses of suspect animals in cold storage pending a more lasting solution.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. This review is in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I have presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of short to medium term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. These proposals take account of the effect of projected increases in population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues identified in the interim report to Government was the need to alleviate anticipated service pressures over the winter per<Col N="599" /> iod. In this regard I was pleased to announce recently an investment package of £25 million to address a number of key service issues in the acute and non acute sectors.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the bed review is now under way and will involve the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The review will also involve a more detailed assessment of need, including an analysis of future bed requirements by medical and surgical specialty.</P>
    <P>I might add that apart from these initiatives, this Government has significantly increased the level of resources available for the development of services for older people over the last few years.</P>
    <P>A range of measures aimed at improving services for older people, including acute assessment and rehabilitation, day hospital, respite and extended care facilities, as well as home support have been identified and are being developed on a phased basis as part of the national development plan and my Department's annual service initiatives.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that much remains to be done in relation to meeting identified service shortcomings in this area and it is my intention to further develop these services for older people as part of the initiatives which I outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any difficulties in filling vacancies for consultant posts. The most recent figures on the level of vacancies of non-consultant hospital doctors in the public hospital service indicate that less than 3% of posts are currently vacant. The shortages occur mainly in the speciality of anaesthesia. My Department has been involved in a number of initiatives to improve the recruitment and retention of junior hospital doctors in the public health service.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific difficulties relating to the recruitment of doctors in the speciality of anaesthetics, a delegation recently visited India and Pakistan to recruit doctors for training posts in Ireland and to promote Ireland as a destination for further training for such doctors. The trip was very successful and should mean that all vacancies in anaesthetics will be filled in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation have recently negotiated improved terms and con<Col N="600" /> ditions for junior hospital doctors. These include a substantial increase in the rate of pay for overtime worked, a training package to be put in place amounting to IR£10 million and the appointment of a senior manager in each major hospital with specific responsibility to manage non-consultant hospital doctors hours. It is also important to note that the medical manpower forum is addressing the main service, training, research and career issues relating to junior hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that legislation was passed this year amending the Medical Practitioners Act to allow for temporary registration of doctors to be extended from five to seven years. I am confident that these measures will not only be helpful in retaining the NCHDs already in the health services but also attract more junior hospital doctors to work in our hospitals. With regard to medical cover for private hospitals, this is a matter for the hospitals concerned.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Health and Children, I am aware that environmental tobacco smoke is considered to be the most significant indoor pollutant because of its prevalence and impact on human health. A link between lung cancer and passive smoking has been accepted for some time. Environmental tobacco smoke is classified as a class A carcinogen, similar to asbestos. While there are prohibitions, restrictions and voluntary codes of practice on smoking in many workplaces, I would like to see measures in place to protect all workers who do not wish to be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in their place of work. A Bill is being prepared in my Department which will, among other things, address this issue.</P>

      <P>As you are aware, adult cardiac bypass surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and since September 1998, St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Paediatric cardiac surgery is carried out at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis. I can confirm that at the end of June 2000, the most recent period for which information is available, there was a total of 587 adults awaiting cardiac surgery over 12 months and 205 waiting for three to 12 months. This represents a reduction of 229 when compared with the figures as at end of December, 1999 of 816 adults awaiting cardiac surgery over 12 months and a reduction of 93 when compared with the end of December 1999 figure of 298 <Col N="602" /> awaiting cardiac surgery for three to 12 months. There was a total of 66 children awaiting cardiac surgery over six months, and ten waiting for three to six months as at 30 June 2000. The total number of cardiac surgery operations carried out on adults and children in the years 1997, 1998, 1999 is 1,531, 1,696 and 1,703 respectively. This includes cardiac surgery procedures purchased under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiatives.</P>
    <P>In 1998, my predecessor allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, my predecessor made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am making a further £4 million available in 2000. I am confident that this year's funding will build on previous years' success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has had and will continue to have a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients, adults and children, awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1586 in September 1997 to 868 in June 2000, which represents a reduction of 55%.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and the proposed new cardiac surgery developments at University College Hospital, Galway, will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50%. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital, to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 644 and 645 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of school medical services, as an integral component of child health services, is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. Arising from the identification of the need for a review of child health services in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated a review of the services in question. This review resulted in the launch of the report, Best Health for Children, at the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>In so far as the school medical services are concerned the report recommends a core programme for child health surveillance for all primary schools in close co-operation with parents and teachers with selective medical examination of children with problems. In addition, the report recommends that children with special needs should receive particular attention. The need for adequate training of key professionals is also underlined.</P>
      <P>With regard to the follow-up process arising from the diagnoses arrived at in the course of the school medical examination programme, the report makes reference to the need for the provision of appropriate referral and treatment services. In particular, the report notes that &ldquo;there should be clearly defined and locally agreed referral pathways, secondary examination and treatment services must be available and appropriate and there should be timely feedback to the referrer and to the GP.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The implementation of the report is a matter for the health boards. The chief executive officers of the health boards have established a national conjoint child health committee and appointed conjoint national child health co-ordinators for the purpose of overseeing implementation of the recommendations of the report in the health boards. The conjoint co-ordinators have indicated that the North-Western Health Board will pilot the new school health services programme in its region in the near future and report the outcome of the evaluation to the co-ordinators. It is anticipated that the pilot programme will commence at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>The school booster immunisation programme did not come within the scope of the Best Health for Children report. I am not aware of any recent evaluation undertaken in relation to this service. However, it is appropriate that, to the greatest extent possible, booster immunisations should continue to be delivered through the schools as this offers the best opportunity to achieve a high uptake in the target population.</P>

    <P>In regard to comparisons with other European countries I understand there is no State funded orthodontic service in Italy, Portugal, Spain or Greece. Orthodontic care is provided for children under public or private health insurance with patient charges in Belgium, France, Germany, Austria and Netherlands. Orthodontic care is provided free of charge through a salaried public service with orthodontic specialists in Denmark and Finland and in Norway and Sweden with patient charges for less severe cases. In the United Kingdom orthodontic care is provided for children through the NHS and the hospital dental service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy on child care is to increase the number of child care places available and to improve the quality of child care services for the community. In support of this policy the national development plan 2000-06, provides £250 million for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to invest in a range of grant measures with the objectives of maintaining and increasing the number of child care places and facilities and improving the quality of child care service provision. The child care sector can also benefit from further supports announced by the Government in budget 2000 and contained in the Votes of the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Health and Children. More recently, the Government has <Col N="606" /> provided a further £40 million for investment in additional support measures for the child care sector. In addition to increased funding for child care, the Government has provided for an integrated approach to the future development of childcare by directing that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform take responsibility for the co-ordination of child care over the course of the national development plan 2000-06.</P>
    <P>I published draft guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities for public consultation in May this year. The consultation period has now elapsed and the submissions received during the public consultation process are being considered with a view to publishing finalised guidelines as soon as possible. The draft guidelines explicitly acknowledged that planning permission for child care facilities had been identified as an area of concern for child care service development. The draft guidelines are intended to address this concern by ensuring a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for child care facilities and to identify the planning issues appropriate to child care facilities. The draft guidelines do not relate to childminding, which is generally a small-scale, home-based economic activity and does not generally require planning permission.</P>
    <P>The guidelines will assist planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans and will also be of interest to developers, builders and child care service providers. The guidelines will also assist the planning authorities in fulfilling the requirement under the recently enacted Planning and Development Act, 2000, that the provision of services for the community, including crèches and other child care facilities, must be included as an objective in development plans. This provision will apply from 1 January 2001. In view of the importance of the issue and the advanced state of the guidelines themselves, when issuing the draft guidelines I asked planning authorities to take the draft guidelines on board straight away. The final guidelines will be issued as ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which was commenced from 1 November 2000. Section 28 requires that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála shall have regard to those guidelines in the performance of their functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 653 and 659 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is required to make a waste management plan in respect of its functional area, which <i>inter alia</i> must address infrastructural requirements in relation to the recovery and disposal of waste, and provide, or arrange for the provision and operation of, such facilities as may be necessary for the recovery and disposal of household waste arising within its functional area. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no function in relation to the provision by individual local authorities of requisite waste management infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, outlined the Government's policy objectives in relation to waste management and provided a national policy framework for the adoption and implementation by local authorities of strategic waste management plans. It strongly endorsed a major reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach utilising a range of waste treatment options to deliver effective and efficient waste services and ambitious recycling and recovery targets. In this context, Changing our Ways addressed the need for short-term flexibility in relation to the provision and utilisation of landfill capacity. It stated that there may be situations where local authorities face an imminent shortage of disposal capacity, with some situations so acute as to require action in advance of the outcome of the current strategic planning process. A commitment to the provision of new landfill facilities, in isolation from the broader issues which require to be addressed, should as far as possible be avoided. Every effort should be made to develop <Col N="608" /> interim solutions which do not prejudice the outcome of longer term strategic solutions.</P>
    <P>Where immediate landfill capacity problems exist, action to extend the life of existing landfill facilities, rather than to provide new landfill sites, should be a priority. This can be facilitated by diverting as much waste as possible to composting and materials recovery, diverting water treatment and sewage sludges for use in agriculture and forestry, as set out in the 1993 national sludge strategy study, and seeking access to landfill capacity available in neighbouring local authority areas.</P>
    <P>Where a local authority determines that it has no option but to provide additional landfill capacity in advance of completion of the strategic planning process, consideration should first be given to the phased development of small scale cells, on or adjacent to existing facilities, rather than the acquisition and development of large greenfield landfill sites for new landfill with a lengthy lifespan.</P>

      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-02 referred to international interest in, and experience of, daytime running lights, DRL, as an instrument of road safety and stated that DRL warranted serious consideration in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following detailed consideration of this complex question, including research, the European Commission has now included DRL among road safety priorities to be progressed at EU level.  Against this background, Dublin Corporation, with the support of my Department, plans to undertake a pilot DRL campaign commencing in January. I intend that the lessons from the pilot exercise, as well as a recent similar exercise in Donegal, will inform decisions regarding further promotion of DRL at national level.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to extend the first-time buyer's grant to those buying older houses as any additional grant aid would, in present market circumstances, be likely to be absorbed in house price increases. A series of measures to assist first time buyers were introduced by the Government in Action on House Prices, April 1998, and Action on the Housing Market, March 1999. Following a further review of the housing market earlier this year and of social and affordable housing programmes the Government launched Action on Housing which contains a number of key measures to assist first-time buyers including: the removal of fiscal incentives to discourage speculators pricing first time buyers out of home ownership; major reductions in stamp duty with an exemption from stamp duty for first time buyers purchasing a second hand house priced up to £150,000; and significant improvements to the terms and conditions of a number of the social housing options, including the local authority affordable housing scheme, the shared ownership scheme, the local authority house purchase loan scheme and the mortgage allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, requires local authorities to prepare housing strategies dealing with the housing needs of all sectors of the population in their areas, including the need for social and affordable housing.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998 Ireland ratified the UNECE, Oslo, Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution, CLRTAP, on Further Reductions of Sulphur Emissions. This requires Ireland to limit sulphur dioxide, SO2, emissions to 30% below 1980 levels by the year 2000. While post-1998 data are not yet available, I am satisfied Ireland is on target to achieve its commitment due,<i> inter alia,</i> to a voluntary agreement by the ESB to cap emissions by 2000.</P>
      <P>In December 1999 Ireland signed the UNECE, Gothenburg, Protocol to the 1979 CLRTAP to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication, and Ground Level Ozone. This will involve further emissions reductions, including a reduction of SO2 emissions by 76% below 1990 levels by 2010. A draft EU directive sets the same national SO2 ceiling for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessary reductions will be achieved by the continuation and intensification of existing <Col N="621" /> measures, including, <i>inter alia,</i> the extension of the EPA's integrated pollution control licensing system to existing electricity generating stations; the implementation of a draft EU directive to set lower emission limits from large combustion plants; the ban on bituminous coal now operating in 12 major urban areas; and reductions in the sulphur content of automotive fuels and other liquid fuels.</P>
    <P>In addition, the recently published National Climate Change Strategy, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, contains a number of cross-cutting measures which will further facilitate a reduction in SO2 emissions, including in regard to the ESB Moneypoint plant, the single largest SO2 point source in the State; the use of cleaner fuels in electricity generation; improving efficiency of electricity generation, and improving efficiency in the domestic and industrial sectors.</P>

      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 indicated that, in common with a majority of EU member states, the Government does not propose at this stage to regulate for a specific prohibition on the use of mobile phones <Col N="627" /> by drivers. The safe use of mobile phones by drivers was instead to be promoted through information campaigns, including campaigns supported by the mobile phone industry. Initiatives in this regard which have already been taken include the sponsorship of a National Safety Council leaflet by Esat Digifone and a further leaflet produced by Eircell and the AA in association with Esso. Notwithstanding the absence of a specific prohibition, use of mobile phone which causes a driver to act in a manner which could be regarded as dangerous or careless may be prosecuted under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

      <P>Kilkenny County Council submitted seven applications to my Department for consideration under the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme in 2000, including an application for funding of £497,400 for the Kilkenny inner relief road-circular road. This application, with all other applications under the specific improvement grants scheme, was considered in my Department, having regard to the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme in 2000. In the event, the Kilkenny inner relief road project was not among the six projects totalling £1,267,000 which were selected from the Kilkenny County Council submission for advancement in 2000 under this scheme.</P>
      <P>It is open to Kilkenny County Council to seek funding for this project when submitting its applications for 2001 under the specific improvement grants scheme, which are due in my Department by 17 November 2000.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of his recent criticism of local authorities and their actions in relation to regional waste management plans, he will place on record the salient points from the recent United States environmental protection agency consultation document suggesting significantly higher health hazards than previously believed from carcinogenic dioxins produced by incinerators; and the views of his expert advisers on the findings.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The United States Environmental Protection Agency, USEPA, has, since 1991, been engaged in a comprehensive reassessment of dioxin science, which it hopes to complete this year. Last June, the USEPA published two chapters of its proposed report for the purpose of scientific peer review. In so doing, it cautioned that the material concerned should not be cited as the agency's final assessment of dioxin risks, and stated that the question of using the outcome of the reassessment for regulatory purposes does not arise until the review procedure is completed.</P>
      <P>The USEPA now characterises the most toxic dioxin compound as a human carcinogen, and proposes to re-evaluate upwards its own 1994 assessment of cancer risk attributable to dioxins. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, has since 1997 classed the relevant dioxin compound as a known human carcinogen. WHO guidelines for tolerable daily intake of and recommendations for dioxins, from 1998, take this classification into account. The USEPA considers that its draft findings are supportive of the WHO position.</P>
      <P>Clearly, because of the potential toxic effects of exposure to dioxins, their emission must, where possible, be strictly controlled and minimised, to ensure exposure does not exceed relevant guidelines and standards. In licensing incineration facilities in Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency already applies a flue gas emission limit value for dioxins of 0.1 nanograms, that is, one ten thousand millionth of a gram, per cubic metre of gas emitted. This extremely stringent standard will shortly be adopted by the EU generally, under the proposed Council directive on the incineration of waste. By comparison, dioxin emission standards issued by the USEPA last year, which will only apply to US hazardous waste incinerators from 2002, are between two and four times higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission estimates that the implementation of the proposed new directive will result in a 99% reduction in emissions of dioxins from waste incineration, relative to 1993-95, and anticipates that the contribution of municipal and clinical waste incineration to overall emissions of dioxins in Europe would be <Col N="630" /> reduced to 0.3%, assuming the output of other sources remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>My Department will monitor the outcome of the ongoing USEPA work.</P>

      <P>I understand following a decision of the courts, Cork Corporation has completed the sale <Col N="631" /> of a number of apartments which were included in the 1989 tenant purchase scheme which allowed for the sale of such dwellings. I have asked the corporation for a report on the management and maintenance arrangements which govern these sales and for an update on their operation to date. In a further case the corporation is appealing to the High Court a decision of the Circuit Court. I also understand the outcome of court actions initiated by other tenants of Cork Corporation and of certain tenants of Dublin and Limerick corporations in relation to the purchase of their local authority apartments is awaited.</P>
      <P>A detailed examination of the sale of apartments under the tenant purchase scheme, undertaken in conjunction with local authorities, concluded that no practical arrangements for the sale could be made that would be satisfactory to purchasers, local authorities or other tenants of the apartments who did not wish to purchase. The sale of local authority apartments to tenant purchasers carries a real and unacceptable degree of risk that the purchasers would end up with a property on which they are paying unaffordable service charges and which they have no prospect of selling at a realistic price. To encourage sales under these circumstances would be a grave disservice to tenant purchasers. Having said that, local authorities will facilitate tenants of apartments, where possible, to transfer to a local authority house, so that they can have the opportunity to purchase that house under the tenant purchase scheme.</P>
      <P>In regard to the sale of maisonettes, local authorities have been advised, under the terms of the current scheme, which took effect on 1 May 1995, that they should consider their sale, particularly those which do not have common areas, where satisfactory arrangements can be devised which do not involve the difficulties that arise in the case of flats.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to introduce a new scheme, I would be prepared to consider favourably any proposals from local authorities, where the authorities are satisfied that apartments could be sold to tenants on terms which would address, to the satisfaction of both the tenants and the authorities, the management and maintenance issues involved.</P>

      <P>The affordable housing scheme, which provides for the sale to eligible purchasers of houses at a discount from the market value, includes provision for a claw-back. As part of the measures to increase the supply of affordable housing set out in Action on Housing, I introduced a site subsidy for houses provided by local authorities under the affordable housing scheme and also in respect of new houses sold by local authorities under the shared ownership scheme. I also brought the provisions of the claw-back under the affordable housing scheme in line with the claw-back provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and I extended those provisions to the shared ownership scheme for new houses sold by local auth<Col N="634" /> orities at a discount from market value. A claw-back provision in the terms of the sale of sites scheme operated by local authorities, where such sites are sold at less than their market value was also introduced.</P>
      <P>The provision of a subsidy financed from public funds is necessary to enable eligible households to attain home ownership while the provision for a claw-back is also necessary to ensure there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a subsidised house or site. In the particular case referred to by the Deputy the sites with a market value of £20,000 are being sold under the sale of sites scheme at a discounted cost of £3,000 per site, that is, at a discount of 85% on the current market value.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 693 and 694 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy on road safety 1998-2002, recognises that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is, however more complex than for alcohol. A number of research programmes are being undertaken internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments.</P>
      <P>In order to advance research in relation to drugs and driving in Ireland, my Department has pledged additional funding, of which some £100,000 has so far been allocated, to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to implement a two year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens. The preliminary findings of this programme were recently made available by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. These findings are based on blood and urine samples submitted to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety between 1 July and 31 December 1999 which were under the legal limit for alcohol; 37% of the samples tested were screened positive for drugs, the most common being cannabis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These early findings underline the Government's view expressed in the road safety strategy that drugs and driving is an issue of growing concern. While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the research programme when completed will, with other international analysis and research in this area, inform the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and pro<Col N="636" /> cedures and possibly changes to existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation it is illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 699 and 703 to 705, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government approved the drafting of a road traffic Bill on 26 July 2000, which will have the principal purpose of providing for a penalty points system. The Bill will also provide for some elements of random breath testing and the further refinement of the legal framework for the detection and processing of offences. The drafting of the Bill is proceeding as a matter of urgency, with a view to its publication by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>To support the administration of the penalty points system, section 25 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, will be commenced, at an appropriate time, to require the carrying of a driving licence while driving.</P>

      <P>The computer application for creating and maintaining a national driver file is scheduled for completion by the end of this year. The next stage will be to install the system in over 30 motor taxation offices throughout the country. This will involve converting all the existing driver information to <Col N="639" /> a single database and setting up a countrywide network linking all the motor taxation offices to the central driver database in Shannon. It is planned to have this completed and to have a national driver file in place by the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>The creation of a national driver file has been linked to a major project to develop a single national system for motor taxation. The central element of the motor taxation system has been operating successfully in Shannon for the last two years. A pilot of the motor taxation office element of the system identified some technical issues which delayed completion and roll-out of the system with consequential delays in the completion of the driver element. These technical difficulties have now been resolved.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> The 2000 non-national road grant allocations included a new funding provision of some £680,000 to enable low cost safety improvement works on non-national roads to be carried out by local authorities. In March 2000 local authorities were requested to submit proposals under this scheme in consultation with the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>Some 175 schemes were forwarded to the Department for funding totalling £2.8 million, 59 schemes were selected for funding this year totalling £685,581. Work on the selected schemes is progressing.</P>

      <P>The potential for international emissions trading is set out in the report of the Consultation Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading which I published together with the National Climate Change Strategy on 1 November 2000. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Sixth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at The Hague later this month is expected to finalise negotiations on the principles, modalities and guidelines for the operation of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, including international emissions trading. Emissions trading has the potential to reduce the costs to parties of meeting the targets of the protocol by identifying and prioritising the least-cost, most economically efficient greenhouse gas emissions reductions within economies and as between parties with targets. It has the potential, therefore, to reduce the costs of making reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The EU negotiating position recognises also the need to undertake action at a domestic level and seeks to put a ceiling on the level of access to international emissions trading.</P>
      <P>The cost of traded emissions units will depend on the operation of any market in such units and may vary over time. I cannot predict what the cost of units may be, but am satisfied that if it is cheaper to make reductions without trading, the preferred choice will be to make the reductions in this manner.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the views expressed by Minister Meacher in regard to recent weather event in the UK. I am satisfied that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are contributing to climate change and will cause further significant changes in the global climate system.</P>
      <P>Anticipated changes arising from human induced climate change in Ireland were set out in Climate Change: Studies in the Implications for Ireland (Department of the Environment, 1991). The recently published National Climate Change Strategy indicates that an updated assessment of the impact of climate change on Ireland will be undertaken, and the EPA is considering research proposals in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to attribute specific weather events, or the weather of any particular season, to <Col N="645" /> the effects of climate change, due to the natural variability of regional climate systems. Nevertheless, the pattern of change in climate to date is widely regarded as indicative of a substantial contribution by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions to observed climate change over the last 50 years.</P>

      <P>Until the 1970s the qualifying age for old age pensions was age 70. In 1970, the retirement pension (RP) was introduced for contributors who retired at age 65. Eligibility for this pension at age 65 is conditional on being fully retired from employment and/or self-employment. A person is regarded as being retired if his/her earnings from <i>(a)</i> employment are less than £30 per week and <i>(b)</i> self-employment are less than £2,500 per annum.</P>
      <P>The old age (contributory) pension (OACP) becomes payable at age 66 and there are no earnings limits associated with this payment for the pensioner. Significantly increasing, or eliminating, the earnings threshold for RP would, in effect, reduce the qualifying age for OACP to 65 and could have significant cost implications.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing the qualifying conditions for old age contributory (OACP) and retirement pensions (RP). The report on the first phase of this review was published recently. Changes to the schemes in question will be considered in the context of the second phase of this review which will get under way in the next few months.</P>

      <P>My Department has for a number of years operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which provide a wide range of support for local self-help and community development groups, and the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs. The focus of the community development programme in particular is on providing support to locally-based community groups involved in anti-poverty work within their communities by supporting these communities to develop their capacity to change their situation for the better, to enable them to participate in society and have a real say in their own development.</P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000 my Department was committed to identifying 30 new priority areas for inclusion in the community development programme. The technical group which advises me on areas for expansion of the programmes, first gathered baseline information on levels of disadvantage and poverty. In this regard the group had available to it, the report Targeting Disadvantage under the Community Development Programme, which was commissioned at its request by the Combat Poverty Agency. The report ranked all areas of the State in terms of comparative disadvantage. Further research was undertaken by the regional support agencies funded under the community development programme to further identify the priority areas for assistance under the programmes.</P>
      <P>County Sligo was not identified as a priority area of disadvantage as part of this process and consequently pre-development work under the programme had not been initiated. Nonetheless, my Department has just received an application, through the Deputy, from a group, which is currently being funded under the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, for inclusion in the programme. Their application will be processed in accordance with the procedures set out for administering the programme and my Department will communicate with the group as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 725, 737 and 747 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment, administered by my Department, for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. Based on the research carried out in the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. There are currently 16,176 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures indicate that 32% of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 75% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, an increase of 115%.</P>
      <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was the extension of carer's allowance to carers of children with disabilities in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance from the health boards. This allowed this group of carers to apply for carer's allowance under the same qualifying conditions as other carers.</P>
      <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his/her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of these changes mean that a couple with two children could have a joint annual <Col N="648" /> income of £9,152 and qualify for the maximum carer's allowance while a couple with up £19,500 could still qualify for a minimum carer's allowance, and also receive an annual respite care grant and the free schemes.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of abolishing the means test and extending carer's allowance at existing levels to all full-time carers would be in the region of £179 million annually. If one were to cost this proposal using the number of carers estimated by the care groups, this figure would rise to £547 million annually.</P>
    <P>The review also examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. The practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments, including those in payment from another country.</P>
    <P>Foreign social security payments are treated in the same manner as their Irish equivalents and are not disregarded when determining income. This ensures that limited resources are not used to make two income payments to any one individual. The review concluded that the payment of two concurrent income support allowances would not be an effective use of resources.</P>

      <Quest>if he will intervene on behalf of a person (details supplied) in County Sligo and have her back to school clothing allowance granted in view of correspondence attached; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCF) is administered on behalf of this Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme allowances of £63 and £78 are payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and 12 to 22 years respectively. These current rates represent a £20 increase on the rates which applied last year.</P>
      <P>The North Western Health Board was contacted and confirmed that a cheque for £126 for BSCF allowance for two children was issued to the person concerned on 19 September 2000. They also confirmed that they have no record of an application for the allowance for the 1999 scheme. It is open to the person concerned to contact her local community welfare officer to discuss this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) is payable to persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The fact that they might previously have been in receipt of another social welfare allowance that has been discontinued is not recorded, as this is not material to their entitlement to SWA. Consequently, as I informed the Deputy in my reply on 25 October 2000 to a similar question the information sought is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information is available in relation to the num<Col N="650" /> ber of people who are paid SWA while awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a disallowance of either disability benefit (DB), unemployment benefit (UB) or unemployment assistance (UA). This includes appeals made by people whose initial claim was rejected with no payment having been made, as well as appeals in cases where payments were made and subsequently discontinued.</P>
    <P>On 20 October last there were 1,109 people in this situation. A table is attached showing the number of people over the past 12 months who received supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) while they were awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a disallowance of either disability benefit (DB), unemployment benefit (UB) or unemployment assistance (UA). A full set of figures for the year prior to this period is not available as computerisation of the SWA scheme was not completed until mid-1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 728 and 750 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent to any person in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined <Col N="652" /> by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which a person is required to pay from his-her own resources towards accommodation costs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, all applicants, including pensioners, are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent. Under the terms of the capital assistance scheme, capital grants are made available by the Department of Environment and Local Government, through local authorities, to approved voluntary bodies to provide accommodation for persons accepted as qualified for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The CAS scheme and rent supplementation to its tenants were examined as part of the December 1995 report of the Review Group on the Role of Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) in relation to Housing. It was noted in that report that in addition to the non-repayable capital grants, subsidies were being paid under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988, and SWA rent supplement was paid to the tenants. In the circumstances, it was decided to set a limit on the amount of rent supplement payable where the tenancy is in accommodation provided under the capital assistance scheme. This is set at £21 per week for a couple and £19 in any other case.</P>
    <P>Rent supplements in general will be examined under the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my <Col N="653" /> Department and other relevant agencies has been established to carry out the review and a report is expected by the end of next year. The level of rent supplementation to tenants of CAS schemes will be examined by the working group. Any proposals for changes in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to lone parents and long-term unemployed persons to return to the labour force. The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people who need the additional income support which the scheme provides to make it financially attractive to them to return to employment. The rules of the scheme, therefore, require that an application must be made prior to taking up employment. Claims made after the person has started work indicate that the person was in a position to take up employment without the need for the financial support which the scheme provides.</P>
      <P>The person concerned commenced employment on 14 April 2000. His application was received in the Department on 19 June 2000 &ndash; over two months later &ndash; and was refused on that basis.</P>

      <Quest>the position in relation to means for the free fuel allowance where a person is over 75 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April regardless of the temperature.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the scheme are that the applicant satisfies a means test, and must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right. There are no exceptions to these conditions on the basis of age and, consequently, people who are over 75 years of age must also satisfy the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who qualify for means tested pensions or allowances such as old age non-contributory <Col N="654" /> pension are accepted as satisfying the means-test. However, if the household includes a person who is in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit or occupational injury benefit then that household will not qualify for a fuel allowance. The benefit recipient could qualify for a £3 smokeless fuel allowance if they are residing in one of the specified areas and are on benefit for more than three months.</P>
    <P>In the case of contributory pensioners such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensioners the income of the qualified adult is assessable as means for the purpose of entitlement to a fuel allowance. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings-investments of up to £30,000 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of fuel allowances to pensioners and I am also conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare system, whenever possible. However, any changes would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>To qualify for participation in the back to education allowance programme an unemployed person must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months (156 days) prior to commencing an approved course of study. The person concerned had been in receipt of unemployment benefit for 71 days prior to participation in a third level course and she is not, therefore, eligible for the allowance.</P>

      <P>The special flat-rate old age contributory pension payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, was introduced for those who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50% of the standard maximum rate, that is, £48 per week from May 2000. The measure, which is in line with the Government's commitment to extend contributory pensions to as many categories of people as possible, is designed to provide a contributory based pension for a group who would otherwise receive no or a very reduced pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support in the event of certain contingencies. As a general rule, where more than one contingency occurs at any one time, only one social welfare payment is payable. In the circumstances, paying a special pre-53 pen<Col N="656" /> sion in addition to a widow/er's contributory pension would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for the WCP are more flexible than those for the OACP. Entitlement may be based on either the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years. In addition, a widow or widower may qualify on either her-his own or the late spouse's insurance record. Where a widow/er has paid PRSI contributions in his-her own right it is open to the person to transfer to the OACP on reaching age 66, provided he-she satisfies the relevant social insurance contribution conditions; the person is entitled to the higher payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 735 and 741 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, as well as to carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance. It is also available to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> In regard to travel for people requiring medical treatment it should be noted that under the provisions of the Health Acts, a health board may make arrangements for the conveyance of patients to and from hospitals. Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    <P>A person is eligible to receive a companion free travel if he or she is in receipt of a disability allowance and is medically assessed as being unfit to travel alone; or is over age 66 years and is in receipt of a qualifying payment and prior to reaching age 66 years, he or she was in receipt of disability allowance and is medically assessed as being unfit to travel unaccompanied; or is residing in health board approved residential care (irrespective of his/her age) and: (<i>a</i>) he or she was previously in receipt of disability allowance or he or she was assessed as being medically suitable for disability allowance and (<i>b</i>) he or she has been medically assessed as being unfit to travel alone, or is blind or severely visually impaired, and he or she satisfies any of the following conditions: (<i>a</i>) receives a blind person's pension; (<i>b</i>) satisfies the blindness condition for the blind person's pension; (<i>c</i>) is registered as a blind person with either the National Council for the Blind of Ireland or the National League of the Blind of Ireland; (<i>d</i>) is age 66 years or over and is in receipt of a qualifying payment and prior to reaching age 66 years, was in receipt of a blind person's pension from this Department or a blind person's tax free allowance; is in receipt of one of a qualifying payment and is certified by either the Irish Wheelchair Association or by his-her GP as being a permanent wheelchair user; is in receipt of full-time care and attention from someone who is receiving carer's allowance from this Department; is age 75 years or over and is medically assessed as being unfit to travel alone. If Deputy Bruton has a specific case in mind, I will have this examined.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin in April this year, examined the issue of extending the companion free travel pass scheme to all people with disabilities and noted that CIE has expressed concerns about the operation of the companion pass, in particular that anecdotal evidence would suggest that some pass holders are quite capable of travelling alone. In this regard, the review notes that companion passes should be issued only to people who have definite needs.</P>
    <P>In view of the free travel scheme's objective to encourage recipients to remain mobile, the review recommends that a free travel companion pass should be issued to all people in receipt of invalidity pension who are unable to travel alone. This would standardise the qualifying conditions <Col N="658" /> for a companion pass for both invalidity pension and disability allowance.</P>
    <P>The report examines a large number of issues and requires detailed consideration. I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in this report in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme an allowance of £63 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. This represents an increase of £20 on last year's rates.</P>
      <P>Full statistics for the scheme for this year are not yet available. While the closing date for applications is 30 September 2000, processing and payment of late claims continue after this date and final returns from the health boards have not yet been received.</P>
      <P>However, indications are that the total value of payments made in 2000 will have increased by about 19% over 1999, while the number of children in respect of whom a payment is made will have fallen by about 15%.</P>
      <P>A BSCF allowance was paid in respect of 249,000 children in 1997, 209,300 children in 1998 and 183,708 in 1999. The decrease in the number of payments being made in recent years is due to increased employment, with more people moving off social welfare less people are qualifying for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by low income households when faced with providing clothing and footwear for children at back-to-school time in September each year. I am also very conscious of the importance of supporting low income families so that their children can participate fully in the education system to the maximum extent possible. In that regard, I have established a working group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is examining all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well the income limits, the means <Col N="659" /> test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues.</P>
    <P>I expect to have the working group's report by the end of this year.</P>

An appointment was made by a investigation officer to interview the applicant on 3 November 2000. On receipt of the investigation officer's report the claim will be considered further.</P>

      <P>The Christmas bonus, which has been paid at a rate equivalent to 70% of a person's normal weekly payment since 1989, subject to a minimum payment of £20, will be increased this year to 100% of a person's normal weekly payment. It will be paid in the first week in December to some 716,000 long-term social welfare recipients at a cost of £65.7 million.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid to recipients of the following payments: disability pension, death benefit, by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pension, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, farm assist, disability allowance, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance, and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus is not payable to recipients of short-term payments such as unemployment benefit or short-term unemployment assistance. Any change in the categories of persons to whom the bonus is paid would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of other priorities and commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million was again provided for the scheme in 2000.</P>
      <P>My Department aims to ensure that individuals are aware of the scheme by advertising it on a national and provincial basis and by disseminating information on the scheme through a range of voluntary organisations and through the community liaison section of the Garda Síochána. In November 1999 in order to further enhance the profile and promote greater awareness of the scheme, my Department circulated a newsletter to some 311,000 pensioners, outlining details of all relevant schemes including information on the scheme of community support for older people. This extensive promotional campaign ensured that all potentially eligible, elderly people, were advised of the scheme and informed of its benefits.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under the scheme is 90% of the once-off costs of purchasing-installing the necessary security equipment. However, the actual level of funding made available for individual applications varies according to individual needs and circumstances and according to the overall demand to be met in relation to the available resources. It is necessary to assess all applications at the same time so that an appropriate level of funding can be determined for each application, taking into account the need to target funding at those most in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to facilitate this process it is necessary to have one closing date for receipt of applications so that an accurate assessment of the total number of applications received and the level of funding sought can be made. This process also <Col N="661" /> reduces the administrative responsibilities of the voluntary organisations who work tirelessly in their communities to improve the social support of the most vulnerable older people and to promote the benefits of the scheme. While the closing date for receipt of applications this year, was 26 May 2000, the regional offices of my Department were flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>
    <P>The scheme is operated on the basis that the security equipment sought by proposed beneficiaries by way of a voluntary group, is purchased and installed upon receipt of grant aid by the voluntary group. The scheme is not intended to reimburse voluntary groups for costs incurred in the advance purchase-installations of security devices. An independent review of the scheme was completed in 1999 and there are no plans to amend the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Following consideration of the evidence by the Department's chief medical adviser an appeals officer has decided that an oral hearing of the appeal is necessary. This will be arranged as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The care recipient was awarded disability allowance with effect from 10 May 2000 at the weekly rate of £190.50 which includes increases in respect of his wife and five children.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups, including people who have been unemployed for a certain minimum period, to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the active work force. To qualify for participation an applicant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, 156 days, immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study. The person concerned was awarded unemployment benefit, which is a qualifying payment for the back to education allowance, with effect from 3 July 2000, a total of 75 days prior to commencing his course of study. Under the rules of the scheme he is not entitled to payment of the allowance.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 11 November 1999 to 13 April 2000 when he was found fit for work by a medical referee of my Department. He appealed this decision and in October an appeals officer upheld the decision to disallow payment of this benefit.</P>
      <P>Periods spent in receipt of disability benefit do not count towards satisfying the condition requiring a minimum of 156 days receipt of a qualify payment. There are, therefore, no grounds for revising the decision in this case.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the weekly rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which a person is required to pay from their own resources towards accommodation costs.</P>
      <P>In addition to the minimum contribution, all applicants, including pensioners, are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent. When budget increases are applied, a rent or mortgage interest supplement recipient who gets an increase in their weekly payment which is greater than the increase in the basic rate of SWA will see a reduction in their rent or mortgage interest supplement equivalent to the difference in the two increases. These rules also apply to unemployed people and other rent supplement recipients who take up part-time employment.</P>
      <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of rent supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area. The limits take into account information received from local auctioneers and letting agents regarding average rents charged in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regu<Col N="664" /> larly by the health boards to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>The manner of calculation of rent supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has been established to carry out the review and a report is expected by the end of next year. Any proposals for changes in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> The question raised by the Deputy relates to the treatment of spouse's earnings for the purpose of means-tested social assistance payments. In assessing the means of a claimant's spouse for such payments, account is taken of the spouse's net earnings, that is, earnings net of income tax, PRSI, health insurance contributions, superannuation and union dues. Currently, an income disregard of £30, plus travel costs, applies where the spouse-partner is working three days or less. A disregard of £70, inclusive of travel costs, applies where such employment exceeds three days per week.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the tapering arrangements which currently apply were improved substantially as a result of measures introduced following the 2000 budget. These measures were designed to ensure that, at the lowest levels of income, that is, where the spouse's earnings are below £95, the family is never worse off as a result of an increase in earnings. Additionally, the poverty trap arising from the withdrawal of the QAA combined with the assessment of the spouse's earnings in the case of recipients of social assistance payments, was further eased by the increase in the spouse income disregard from £45 to £70 where the employment exceeded three days per week.</P>
    <P>Any further relaxation of the means test along the lines suggested by the Deputy would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the Government's priorities.</P>

      <Quest>if he will revise the payment of social welfare contributions to allow a person when they reach the age of 66 years to continue to pay contributions if they had not built up sufficient contributions to qualify them for a contributory old age pension in view of the fact that some people are working beyond the age of 66 years and would be quite happy to receive their pension later than the age of 66; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years more and more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme. Some of the more significant improvements in recent years include the introduction of pro-rata pensions for people with mixed insurance records, the reduction in the number of contributions required for the old age contributory pension to a yearly average of ten and the introduction of a special old age contributory pension for self-employed people in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, this year's Social Welfare Act provided for further recognition of contributions paid prior to 1953 through the introduction of a <Col N="666" /> new flat-rate, 50%, pension for people who had previously failed to qualify for an old age contributory pension due to the yearly average test or who qualified for a pension payment at a lower rate. This is in line with this Government's commitment to extend contributory pensions coverage to as many categories of people as possible.</P>
    <P>These improvements have led to a significant increase in the number of people who can now qualify for a contributory pension. My Department is currently reviewing the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. The report on the first phase of this review was published recently and proposed, amongst other things, that the average contribution test, on which entitlement is currently based, be replaced by a system based on the actual number of contributions paid-credited. The implementation of this system will be considered in the second phase of the review. Further improvements will be considered in a budgetary context in the light of this work.</P>

      <P>The recently published White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector recognises the need to promote the active involvement of people in community and voluntary groups as an essential component of a democratic society. A range of concerns an interesting proposals regarding recognition and encouragement of volunteering have been put forward in the course of the White Paper consultation process.</P>
      <P>These concerns and proposals will be examined by the National Committee on Volunteering as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This committee, with participation from all the relevant interests and stakeholders, will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the international year, but for the longer term.  </P>
      <P>This committee is currently in the process of being established and nominations for its membership are due to be submitted to my Department by the end of this week. A budget of £1 million has been allocated to the workings of the committee and its work will take account of the importance of proactively fostering a culture of support for volunteering. It will also examine and make recommendations on the possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer; measures to widen pool of volunteers; and the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering.</P>
      <P>The United Nations has designated the year 2001 as International Year of the Volunteer. It is proposed that the initial function of the national committee be to agree a broad strategy for IYV 2001. The main objectives of the year are the recognition, promotion, facilitation and networking of volunteering contributions world-wide. The international year provides an opportunity to further raise the profile of volunteering in Ireland and progress the Government's policies with regard to development of social capital and encouragement of voluntarism. The international launch of International Year of Volunteers will take place on 5 December 2000.</P>

      <P>I am looking generally at the issue of the cost of goods and services on the offshore islands. It is widely recognised that the costs of goods and services on our offshore islands largely reflect <Col N="673" /> higher transportation costs. In recognition of this, I have already improved or initiated new subsidised ferry services to 11 offshore islands. Furthermore my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government have radically increased the new house grant payable on offshore Islands and very recently I announced a major increase from £3,450 to £12,000 in the house improvement grant on Gaeltacht islands. In relation to the specific question of the cost of home heating oil, I am actively considering, in consultation with other relevant Departments, various ways to ameliorate the effect of this on the islanders.</P>

      <P>I am still awaiting formal approval for this scheme from the EU Commission but if the person referred to considers that compensation is due because his use of his land has been restricted, he should contact the Dúchas regional manager for his area, in this case: Dr. Noel Kirby, Connemara National Park, Letterfrack, County Galway.</P>

      <P>The lifting of the suspension of funding relating to the proposed golf course at Doonbeg, County Clare, arose out of confirmation of the respective positions of the Irish authorities and the EU Commission on the following issues: The EU Commission confirms that the existing management agreement for <i>Vertig Angustior </i>is technically acceptable as a means of ensuring that the golf course project does not have a significant negative effect on the snail population present on the golf course site. The Irish authorities are committed to the full implementation of the existing management agreement. The Irish authorities are committed to formally transmitting all outstanding sites, that they are considering for <i>V. angustior </i>and fixed dunes with herbaceous vegetation, grey dunes, by November 2000. The Irish authorities are prepared to positively respond, within the framework of the directive, to any legal concerns of the Commission in relation to the basis for proposing Ireland's Natura 2000 contribution for <i>V. angustior </i>that may remain after 30 November. Any additional measures required will be completed within a four month period. The commission's notes the view of the Irish authorities that the remaining Irish sites for grey dunes, to be formally transmitted by 30 November 2000, should satisfactorily respond to the commission's concern that the Irish contribution of sites for grey dunes may prove to be insufficient.</P>
      <P>I was pleased that, by entering into formal commitments to carry-out my policy in regard to the Natura 2000 Network, the commission were enabled to lift the suspension on co-funding referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In May, 1998 I appointed, with Government approval, the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, to conduct a review of services and arrangements in place in this jurisdiction to meet the needs of those who had suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years. In his report &ldquo;A Place and a Name&rdquo;, Mr. Wilson made wide-ranging recommendations on measures to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering of those in question.</P>
      <P>My Department has been involved in detailed discussions with other relevant Departments and agencies on the implementation of the recommendations, and in some areas work has already commenced on implementation.</P>
      <P>As regards the balance of Mr. Wilson's recommendations, including the recommendation that a high ranking civil servant, preferably in the Department of the Taoiseach, should be designated to advance and monitor the implementation of the report's recommendations, I am now finalising a detailed implementation plan, based on the consultations which have taken place, and I intend to submit this to Government very shortly for approval.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, permits the application of different height criteria for men and women provided that the criteria chosen are such that the proportion of women in the State likely to meet the criterion for women is approximately the same as the proportion of men likely to meet the criterion for men.</P>

      <P>Following the establishment of the European Union, the European Commission has adopted a series of eight directives to date in relation to summer time arrangements in the European Union. The most significant development to come from these directives has been the harmonisation of the date of change to summer time in member states.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has commissioned a comprehensive study on summer time. The study was aimed at identifying and evaluating the effects of summer time in all member states of the Union and, in particular, in the fields of energy consumption, public health, working conditions and lifestyles, agriculture, environmental protection, road safety and the tourism and leisure industries.</P>
      <P>The Commission's study will be considered in conjunction with proposals for summer time arrangements with the other member states of the European Union.</P>

    <P>A total of 12 individuals serve on a prison visiting committee at any one time. Members of committees are appointed by the Minister for a term not exceeding three years. At that point they are automatically removed from the committee and are either reappointed for a further term or are replaced by new members. Where a committee shows a number in excess of 12 this can be explained by members of visiting committees resigning before the expiry date of their term and being replaced by new members.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note: </i>Travel and Subsistence at appropriate rates is paid only when actually incurred.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the person referred to was, together with a number of other prisoners, transferred to Ireland from the United Kingdom on Friday, 3 November 2000. The remainder of his sentence will be enforced in accordance with the laws and regulations which apply to sentenced persons in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As I have explained in the past, the Council Of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, requires that extensive documentation be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the prisoner concerned. On receipt of those consents, an application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the prisoner concerned and his/her continued detention here. Finally the practical arrangements, including whatever security arrangements are considered necessary, must be put in place prior to effecting the transfer of the prisoner concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These procedures are required under the convention and must be adhered to in processing each application. Completing all the required procedures takes time. However, I can assure the <Col N="702" /> Deputy that every effort was made in this case to complete all the required procedures as quickly as possible and no undue delay occurred.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): The Firearms Acts, 1925 to 2000, provide that it is not lawful for any person, with some exceptions such as firearms dealers, to have in his/her possession, use or carry a firearm unless such possession is authorised by a firearm certificate granted under the Acts.</P>
    <P>The power to grant or refuse to grant a firearm certificate to any person resident in the State is vested in the superintendent of the Garda district where the person resides. One of the conditions for the granting of a firearm certificate is that the superintendent shall be satisfied that the applicant can be permitted to have the firearm in his/her possession without danger to the public safety or to the peace. I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that new firearm storage requirements were introduced earlier this year which are being challenged in the High Court by way of an application for judicial review. As this matter is the subject of High Court proceedings, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>

      <P>It is not the general practice to comment publicly on individual applications for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence with the expectation by the applicant that such confidence will be preserved. However, I can confirm that the applicant referred to was interviewed in connection with his asylum application on 3 October 2000. The application is currently being considered and it is expected that a decision will issue to the applicant shortly.</P>
      <P>Applicants for asylum are currently dealt with under &ldquo;The Procedures for Processing Asylum Claims in Ireland&rdquo; as notified to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee &ndash; UNHCR. All applicants are at present provided with an information leaflet in one of 24 languages at the time of their initial application and prior to interview which sets out these procedures and advises them of their rights including access to legal support. The leaflet also includes details of useful contacts including the Refugee Legal Service &ndash; RLS. These procedures provide for applicants to contact at any time, the UNHCR representative and/or a legal representative of his or her choice.</P>
      <P>Any applicant may seek legal assistance from the RLS at any stage of the asylum application process. With effect from 2 March 2000, the RLS was given full responsibility for the State funded scheme of legal assistance to asylum seekers. Under these arrangements an individual who wishes to obtain legal advice or assistance in relation to his or her application has the choice of either using the services of the RLS including its private practitioners panel or of engaging private legal representation to provide advice in relation to their application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interviews are scheduled on the basis that it will take on average three and a half hours to conduct an interview. There is no defined time limit on the duration of an interview as each interview will vary in length from as little as one hour to five or more, depending on the circumstances of an applicant. On average an interview takes approximately three hours. An applicant may be accompanied by a representa<Col N="704" /> tive at interview and the representative is given an opportunity to make any points at the end of the interview. In addition, at any point before or up to five working days after the interview, the applicant or their representative may make written representations relating to the case.</P>
    <P>Applicants attending for interview are provided with interpretation facilities where practical and possible in their chosen language for interview, a waiting area, rooms for consultation with legal representatives and toilet facilities in the interview suite at the Refugee Applications Centre in 79/83 Lower Mount Street.</P>

      <P>The visa application in question has recently been refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of a study visa. The application in question did not comply with my Department's student visa guidelines in that the applicant proposed to participate in a part-time publicly funded course of education and had not displayed sufficient evidence of obligations to return home following her stay or of resources to support herself while studying here. It is open to the applicant to appeal the refusal of a visa by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 786 and 794 together.</P>
      <P>The report referred to is the report on the general health care study of the Irish prisoner population which was undertaken by the National University of Ireland, Galway, and published last August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report will help to inform the development of policy on the prison medical services and will be considered by the group to review the structure and organisation of Prisons Health Care Services. The terms of reference of this group, which I established in November 1999, includes: <Col N="707" /> to consider and make recommendations regarding the structure and organisation of primary medical and nursing services within the prison environment in light of the development of health care services generally and the needs of the prison population; to consider and make recommendations regarding the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners, taking into account changes in service provision generally and the potential ramification of possible new mental health legislation; to consider the appropriate need and level of in-house provision of specialist medical services and make recommendations accordingly; to consider structures for the legal and professionally appropriate control of pharmaceutical products within the prison system; to consider the present organisation of prison dental services and make any appropriate recommendations; and to consult with all relevant professional and representative bodies in this connection.</P>
    <P>The review body is under the chairmanship of Mr John Olden, Second Vice-President of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment of Persons in Custody, and former Secretary of Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The membership of the review group consists of representatives of: Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Department of Health and Children; Department of Finance; Director of Prison Medical Services; a senior prison governor; a nominee of the Irish College of General Practitioners; a nominee of the Royal College of Psychiatry; a nominee of An Bord Altranais; a nominee of the Pharmaceutical Society; and a nominee of the Irish Dental Council. As the review is still ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the group's work at this time. I expect to have a report from the group by summer 2001. It is my intention that this report will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I have appointed a full-time doctor to the new prison at Cloverhill in Clondalkin, and propose to do so in the Midlands Prison in the near future. I have also recently obtained Government approval to proceed with a strategy to address the drug problem in partnership with the health authorities. This will entail the appointment of doctors, nurses, psychologists and addiction counsellors as well as the training of prison officers. Already 49 nurses have been appointed to the prison service, which includes 16 in the remand prison at Cloverhill.</P>

      <P>An application for naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 19 October 2000. Due to the various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation in respect of a person of full age, together with the high number of applications being received, the average processing time at present is approximately two and a half years.</P>
      <P>Extra resources are currently being allocated to the Immigration and Citizenship Division of my Department with a view to,<i> inter alia</i>, reducing the time involved in processing naturalisation applications. These resources will impact considerably on present delays. As soon as full consideration has been given to this application, I will advise both the applicant and the Deputy of my decision.</P>

      <P>Since this Government came into office, there have been 11 appointments to the District Court. These appointments are a matter of public record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> As I stated in reply to a parliamentary question on 5 October last, I have received over 40 representations from Members of the Oireachtas in respect of judicial appointments. Eight persons, on whose behalf representations were made, were subsequently appointed, all to the District Court Bench.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that it goes beyond the protocol of this House to name individual people who have been the subject of ministerial representations. However, the most important point is that there could well be cases where the recommendations were made without the knowledge of the person involved. Accordingly, it would be grossly unfair to provide the details of these representations and thus provoke possible misguided speculation in respect of members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>In any event, again referring back to the reply I gave on 5 October, these representations are not particularly relevant because it has been the practice of this Government and indeed the previous Government to make appointments solely from the list submitted by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board as provided for under the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has committed £250 million to the child care measure under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. In April of this year, I announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for child care providers under the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
      <P>Since I announced these measures in April, more than 140 requests for application forms have been received from County Meath. To date, three completed applications for funding have been returned. These three applications were for capital funding from private child care providers. Of these, two of the projects have been approved for funding totalling approximately £34,000. The third application is under consideration. The Minister of State at this Department, Deputy Mary Wallace, addressed the annual conference of the Irish Pre-school Playgroup Association in Meath last weekend and appealed to existing and new providers to return their completed grant application forms to my Department. My Department has no closing date on the childcare grants scheme to facilitate the return of application forms but we can obviously only allocate money when applications are submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October I announced details of the Govern<Col N="710" /> ment's anti-inflationary package for child care which provides £40 million over and above the £250 million already allocated to child care. My own Department has been allocated £26.5 million of this which will be used as follows: a sum of £9 million will be provided for capital grants for private providers of more than 20 childcare places &ndash; this new grant will allow providers to establish or improve childcare facilities; a sum of £5 million to provide grants for community-based/not-for-profit childcare facilities which do not qualify for existing grants schemes; a sum of £1 million for improved staffing grants for community-based/not-for-profit projects &ndash; this will allow staffing grants of up to £80,000 to be allocated to these projects; a sum of £6.5 million for a national childminders initiative &ndash; this is the first national initiative targeted specifically at childminders and will involve start-up grants, information campaigns and other supports; and a sum of £5 million for improving quality through training and research &ndash; this will help ensure that people working in child care can progress in their careers and that the highest standards are achieved in childcare.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Environment and Local Government have been allocated funding under the £40 million anti-inflationary package for child care as follows: a sum of £2.5 million for the use of spare classrooms for child care. More than 100 schools have already indicated a willingness to allow their spare classrooms to be used for child care and this funding will provide them with financial support towards this; a sum of £5 million for a national after-school initiative. This will provide grants for schools to put in place programmes running until at least 6 p.m; a sum of £1 million for child care employment grants. Valued at up to £5000 these grants will be available through city and county enterprise boards for private providers who take on new child care workers; and a sum of £5 million for the provision of child care in local authority developments. This will involve existing as well as new housing schemes.</P>
    <P>Application forms for the measures operated by my Department may be obtained from my Department's Equal Opportunities Child care Section. My Department will give consideration to any applications for funding for child care facilities from providers throughout the country.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the present recruitment of applicants to the Garda Síochána did not await the outcome of the review of height requirement for entry to the Garda Síochána, as announced by him on 14 June 2000.</Quest>

      <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000 by the end of 2002. In order to achieve this objective, it was necessary to advertise the new competition in October with a view to holding the competition for selection of Garda trainees in December. There is a lengthy time gap between the commencement of a competition and the actual intake of recruits due to the time required for the processing of applications, the holding of tests and interviews, medical examinations, security clearance etc.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána physical competence test review group is currently looking at the question of pre-entry physical competence tests for applicants wishing to join the Garda Síochána and the validity of the present height requirements. The review group is due to report before the end of the year and I will carefully consider whatever recommendations are contained in their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the present height requirements, any recommendation for change in this regard <Col N="713" /> would, if acted upon, require the amendment of the existing Regulations &ndash; the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988.</P>
    <P>I should also say that experience in other countries which have introduced a physical competence test indicates that a period of validation of the proposed test is required before its final adoption. This is especially important in terms of assessing the impact of the test in the context of gender.</P>

      <P>The building and major refurbishment of Garda stations is carried out in conformity with a priority list compiled in consultation with the Garda authorities, Garda staff associations and the Office of Public Works. Although it is the intention to build a new station on the site of the old station and married quarters, there are 12/13 Garda stations on this list with a priority higher than the station nominated by the Deputy that have yet to be addressed.</P>
      <P>It should be noted, however, that works are not always undertaken in strict numerical sequence as, for instance, the commencement of a project may first be dependent upon the successful acquisition of a greenfield site for development. Although a sketch scheme for the new Garda station in question has been approved by local Garda management, it is not possible to state, at this point, when the site works might commence. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the building of the station will be progressed as far as is feasible in accordance with the agreed priority list, and to a timeframe determined by overall Garda building priorities and the availability of resources.</P>

It covers a total of 14,180 acres. The sub-district became part of the Dublin Metropolitan Area &ndash; DMA &ndash; on 23 March 1998.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas that the current personnel strength &ndash; all ranks &ndash; of Rathcoole Garda Station is 19 &ndash; comprising of two sergeants, one inspector, 14 gardaí and two detective gardaí. These figures do not include a member from Rathcoole station who is currently on United Nations duty.

    <P>I am also informed that the patrolling of Rathcoole is augmented by the divisional drug, <Col N="720" /> traffic and task force units which have a combined strength of 44 &ndash; all ranks.</P>
    <P>Rathcoole Garda station is open to the public each day from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. The extension of the current opening hours is at present under review. Outside these hours the telephone is redirected to Clondalkin Garda station and it is envisaged that the Garda &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; will be connected to Clondalkin station within the next number of weeks.</P>
    <P>A patrol car attached to Rathcoole station is operated on a 24 hour basis. Where necessary, patrol cars from other stations within the district &ndash; Clondalkin, Ronanstown, Ballyfermot &ndash; respond to calls for assistance if the Rathcoole patrol car is otherwise engaged. All these mobile patrols are directly under the control of the Garda communications centre at Harcourt Square which ensures that all emergency calls are responded to expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Outside the present opening hours, gardaí are available to patrol the sub-district. These patrols are performed in the official patrol car and by foot patrols to ensure a visible presence in the Rathcoole area. Crime figures for Rathcoole sub-district indicate a 10.9% decrease in recorded crime during the first ten months of 2000 compared to the same period of 1999. Statistics in respect of 1996 to 1999 (January to September, inclusive) are as follows:</P>

    <P>The allocation of Garda resources to Rathcoole Garda station will be closely monitored to ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness. When additional resources next become available, the needs of Rathcoole will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of all Garda districts throughout the country. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the town of Kill is situated in the district of Naas which is part of the Carlow-Kildare division. Kill has its own Garda station. Rathcoole was part of the Naas district prior to its inclusion in the DMA.</P>

I am further informed that this dealing refers to an application under section 49, that is, acquisition of title by virtue of long possession, of the Registration of Title Act, 1964. I understand that, due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49 which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that queries issued to the lodging solicitor on 31 August 2000 and that the dealing cannot progress until these queries have been satisfactorily resolved. I assure the Deputy that on receipt of a satisfactory response to these queries, the application will receive attention.</P>

      <P>Under the sports capital programme for 2000, 1,650 applications were received in my Department and 677 projects have been allocated grants this year. Accordingly, the programme for 2000 is now closed but I am planning to announce details of the 2001 programme next month and it will be open to the college in question to apply in accordance with the criteria and conditions stipulated under the programme.</P>

I understand that following the recent resolution of outstanding issues between the Irish Sports Council and the Irish Amateur Boxing Association the balance of the annual grant for 2000 has now been issued.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the 2000 sports capital programme I recently announced grant allocations totalling £324,000 to 64 boxing clubs around the country. Among these was a grant of £30,000 to the Holy Family Boxing Club in Drogheda.</P>

      <P>I presume the body to which the Deputy refers is the Tourism Marketing Partnership, TMP, which was established by me in April 2000 and involves representatives of the tourist industry working together with Bord Fáilte in developing complementary strategies and plans for the totality of their combined annual marketing expenditure.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the tourism industry is a very diverse sector made up of many different interests, representative groups and thousands of individual firms. Their principal overall representative body is the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC.</P>
      <P>I understand from ITIC, which made the industry nominations to the TMP and its two sub-groups, that their nominations were designed to achieve an equitable balance between the various interests and to allow for the broadest sectoral representation, including strong representation by air and sea carriers.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, very conscious of the important contribution which low cost carriers make to tourism traffic development. I have encouraged any such carrier who has made representations to me on the subject to take appropriate steps to open up the possibility of their representation on the TMP institutional framework through the agreed industry nomination procedure.</P>

      <P>Following the public advertising of the sports capital programme for 2000, 1,650 applications were received, including an application from the organisation in question. All the applications were assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions governing the programme. Following this assessment, allocations were made to 677 applicants, including the group in question. This is additional to the grant allocated to this group in 1998 which is still to be drawn down. The group subsequently wrote to my Department on 4 October 2000 requesting permission to change the purpose for which both grants were allocated, due to extenuating circumstances. This was agreed to in principle on 5 October 2000 and my Department is still awaiting further details from the organisation in question so that the grant can be confirmed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the commitment set out in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of the Regional Tourism Authorities, RTAs, was carried out during 1999. The objective of the review was to ensure that RTAs would be positioned to make the optimum contribution to the realisation of national tourism objectives and targets set by Government, while taking into account regional priorities and customer focus.</P>
      <P>In the context of the review, a report on the RTAs was commissioned by Bord Fáilte from Fitzpatrick Associates to assist their deliberations. In September last year I received from the chairman of Bord Fáilte a copy of the Fitzpatrick's report, together with the board's opinions on it's main recommendations. Discussions between officials from my Department and Bord Fáilte on issues arising from the review process were concluded earlier this year. Since then, Bord Fáilte has outlined a new vision for the future of the RTAs to each authority, setting out roles and performance indicators for them.</P>
      <P>This is incorporated in annual performance contracts, between Bord Fáilte and each RTA, covering issues such as Bord Fáilte Éireann funding, visitor servicing, marketing and promotion, tourism development, and the co-ordination role of the RTAs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, RTAs have welcomed this new contractual framework and, to date, all the RTAs <Col N="728" /> have signed up to, or agreed to sign up to, the contract. I am confident that this new framework, which marks a major advance in the regional administrative structure, will give increased clarity and focus to the work of the RTAs, enabling them to maximise their contribution to regional and national tourism performance. </P>
    <P>The Fitzpatrick's report was one input, albeit a very important one, into the overall review process and as such I have no plans to formally publish the report. Copies of the report have, however, been made available to the Members of the Dáil Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation and I would refer any other interested parties to Bord Fáilte which commissioned the report.</P>

      <Quest>if the FÁS community employment schemes will still remain as options for the employment of school secretary's and caretakers as the £4,000 grant, which his Department now sanctions for these services, is in no way sufficient to provide an adequate level of service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23919/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the use of the community employment schemes by schools, responsibility for the operation of such schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in that Department regarding this issue. In general, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision by my Department of additional assistance to schools for secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme <Col N="731" /> has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
    <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil, £20 per pupil in respect of each service, subject to a maximum of £20,000, maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
    <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided.</P>
    <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January this year. Furthermore, with effect from September this year, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or fewer.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools are receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>At second level the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements at second level.</P>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services under the PESP scheme. There are also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools.</P>
    <P>All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am satisfied that my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from September 2000 is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. While provision <Col N="732" /> for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>

      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters.

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, is currently engaged in a project that involves all national schools in County Monaghan. All remedial teachers in the county have received training in the administration and scoring of group tests of intelligence and of attainments. They are now about to administer the tests in schools. When this phase of the project has been completed, each remedial teacher will have an extended consultation with one of the NEPS psychologists. This will include discussion on children about whom concerns have been expressed and advice will be offered on educational programmes and behavioural management. If necessary, individual psychological consultations will be arranged for some of the children.</P>
      <P>The child named by the Deputy would be included in this project and will be offered the appropriate educational psychological assessment in the course of the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Inclusiveness and transparency are core principles underpinning the leaving certificate examination. The examination was made more inclusive this year by allowing a student, depending on his or her special need to, in effect, obtain a waiver from an element of the examination in a subject. Drawing on best international practice this significant improvement was enabled by having an explanatory note accompany the grade.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases the grade awarded is a full and accurate reflection of the candidate's performance in the examination and the examination certificates issued by my Department will state that unequivocally.</P>
      <P>This new measure enables a candidate to obtain maximum marks for the subject even though his or her special need precludes him or her from demonstrating attainment in core elements of the standard assessment. In other words the grade awarded which will subsequently be used to calculate points for third level admission purposes need no longer be based on some element of standard assessment that he or she would have difficulty with. While recognising the autonomy of third level institutions in relation to setting their admission policies the overall policy thrust is to ensure increased participation by those with special needs at third level and I fully expect this measure to assist in that regard. It is also consistent with the report of the commission on the points system which set out the need to facilitate in every way possible those with special needs both in terms of initial access to third level and thereafter in terms of their needs while at third level.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the Exploring Masculinities programme. This is a programme in personal and social development for transition year and senior cycle young men, age 15-18 years. The programme, a manual, including teaching materials and video, is available to schools to use as resource material.</P>
      <P>The programme covers a wide range of issues that are relevant to the lives of males and puts them in the context of the changes that are affecting the lives of men and women in the world of today, economic, legislative, social. It is based on recommendations from extensive research and from Government reports and is set within the legislative framework of this country and the European Union as well as the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
      <P>The programme was initiated by the equality committee of my Department in 1995 and was developed in association with the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland. It was externally evaluated by a team of educationalists from the University of Limerick.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of programmes in gender equality for girls since the mid-1980s. In the early 90s, the European Commission issued guidelines in relation to the need to develop educational materials which would specifically address the issue of equal opportunities for boys and girls, women and men. This country was invited to participate in an initiative in this area and the materials developed as part of this initiative, BALANCE-Who cares?, are in use in a large number of single sex girls schools and co-educational schools. However, since there was little take-up of the materials in single sex boys schools, despite their being made available to them, the Exploring Masculinities programme was developed, specifically targeted at single-sex boys schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> The use of the programme by schools is entirely voluntary and they are free to offer the programme or to use it as resource material, subject, as with any other similar programme, to the agreement of the parents and pupils concerned.</P>

      <P>The enrolment at the school in question decreased from 212 pupils on 30 September 1998 to 203 pupils on 30 September 1999.

In addition the school has the services of a language support teacher.</P>
      <P>An enrolment of 205 pupils on the 30 September 1999 was required in order to retain the seventh mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year. Therefore, I regret that this post cannot be restored to the school for the 2000-01 school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years, a range of initiatives has been introduced to ensure a sufficient supply of skilled personnel in emerging labour market needs areas. These initiatives have focused to a large extent on the needs associated with the strong growth of the information technology, IT, sector.</P>
      <P>The first of these initiatives was the Joint Public-Private Initiative for Capital Funding, 1996-2000, aimed at providing some 6,200 additional new places in areas of agreed labour market needs, including 1,800 places in the computer science area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> Following the report of the interim skills group in late 1996, which identified emerging skills needs, an additional 650 places in software engineering and over 500 additional places in engineering technician programmes were approved for the 1997-98 academic year as part of the Government response An Action Plan for Skills. Subsequently, the Government announced the establishment of the £250 million education technology investment fund and the Scientific and Technological Education Fund Bill was enacted in December 1997. One of the objectives of the fund is to develop new areas of activities in third level institutions, especially where emerging skills needs have already been identified. The fund provided investment of £60 million for the skills area to provide an additional annual output of 1,000 software graduates and 750 technicians.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the Government established the expert group on future skills needs as part of the business, education and training partnership set up to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skill needs, manpower needs estimation and education and training for business. The first report of the expert group on future skills needs was published in December 1998 and addressed the needs of the information technology sector. In response to the needs identified, this Government approved an additional investment of £75 million for the provision of 5,400 third level places, predominately in the engineering and computer hardware and software areas. Some £6 million was provided for the continuation of the post-graduate conversion programmes in IT related areas and there are some 1,500 students currently participating in these programmes.</P>
    <P>The accelerated technician programmes, which the institutes of technology introduced in January 1998 in manufacturing technology, have since been expanded to include information technology. These programmes are aimed at non-standard applicants, for example, mature students, women returning to work, disabled people and under employed people, and those in employment who wish to advance their skills, The programme provides for structured work placement for six months and are based on a partnership between industry and institutes with industrial involvement in course design, selection and placement. To date, some 2400 students have participated in the programmes, which are aimed at alleviating identified skills shortages.</P>
    <P>The second report of the expert group focused on a wider range of skills needs. In relation to the IT sector, the report notes that, as a result of this Government's investment, the projected annual supply of IT degree professionals will be more than double the 1996 levels by 2003, while the supply of IT technicians will increase by more than 50 per cent. Given these trends, the expert group did not recommend a further increase in places. The expert group will, however, continue <Col N="749" /> to monitor the situation within the IT sector and will bring forward recommendations as appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Exploring masculinities is a programme in personal and social development for transition year and senior cycle young men, age 15-18. The programme, which includes a manual including teaching materials and video, has been made available to schools requesting it. The use of the programme by schools is entirely voluntary and they are free to offer the programme or to use it as resource material subject, as with any other similar programme, to the agreement of the parents and pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>The programme covers a wide range of issues relevant to the lives of males and puts them in the context of the changes affecting the lives of men and women in the world of today-economic, legislative and social. It is based on recommendations from extensive research and from Government reports and is set within the legislative framework of this country and the European Union as well as the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> The programme was initiated by the equality committee of my Department in 1995 and was developed in association with the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland. It was externally evaluated by a team of educationalists from the University of Limerick, who concluded that teachers and students participating in its development welcomed the thrust of the programme and saw it as having positive outcomes for students.</P>
    <P>While the programme has attracted some adverse publicity in the media, the response from schools and other educationalists who have contacted my Department has been extremely positive.</P>
    <P>I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to review the programme, with particular reference to the response to the programme, the use and outcomes of the programme in schools, to include the views of teachers, parents and young persons participating in the programme. In addition, I have asked the council to provide me with an assessment of the content and process of the programme, having regard to best practice in this and in other countries, the implications of relevant current policy and legislation in this area and the issues raised in the current public debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a function of each class teacher to monitor the progress of pupils with Down's Syndrome in his or her classroom. This should be undertaken on a regular basis and should be broadly based, covering the various curricular areas and the different areas of child development. In general, this type of regular monitoring is adequate. Where there is cause for concern, the pupil can be referred for re-assessment to the service that originally conducted the pupil's assessment. Such assessments can also be arranged at key stages in the pupil's school life.</P>
      <P>Schools are advised to communicate regularly with the parents of all pupils, including those with Down's Syndrome. Teachers do so at parent-teacher meetings, at informal meetings with parents and in written progress reports. I can assure the Deputy that I would regard it as very important that parents of all pupils, including those with Down's Syndrome, be kept informed of their children's progress.</P>

      <P>My Department's response to special education needs is based on the following categorisations: visual impairment; hearing impairment; profound hearing impairment; mild general learning disability; moderate general learning disability; severe-profound general learning disability; emotional disturbance; severe emotional disturbance; physical disability; specific speech and language disorder; specific learning disability; multiple disabilities and autism-autistic spectrum disorder.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that individual children can suffer from more than one disability and in varying degrees. Ultimately, the response provided is determined by reference to the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>Precise details of the number of children involved in each specific disability category are not readily available in my Department. However, I can confirm that approximately 7,400 children are enrolled in special dedicated schools; a further 4,000 approximately are enrolled in special classes attached to ordinary schools; and approximately 7,100 children with special needs are attending mainstream schools on an integrated basis.</P>
      <P>In October 1998 the Government decided that all children with special needs within the primary system should be entitled to an automatic response to their needs, irrespective of the level of need involved or their location. As a result of this development my Department has now sanctioned a total of over 660 full-time resource teachers and over 1,440 full-time special needs assistants to support children with special needs in integrated settings. Further resource teacher and special needs assistant posts are being allocated on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs. In addition, there are approximately 1,000 teachers employed in the special school system.</P>
      <P>The allocations in question are not limited by reference to available finance. Rather, the number of posts allocated is determined solely by the level of need which requires to be addressed.</P>
      <P>In the second level system, the equivalent of 70 whole-time special needs assistant posts and 240 whole-time resource teacher posts have been allocated to cater for children with special needs.</P>

      <P>The Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, was located originally in Blackrock. It subsequently moved to Clonskeagh and will move to its permanent location in Grange, County Meath, early in 2002.</P>
      <P>The educational facilities for children of FVO staff is a matter of ongoing discussions between officials of the FVO and my Department. Arising from these discussions it has been agreed that international annexes would be established in two locations, one in the south Dublin area and the other adjacent to Grange or its environs.</P>
      <P>A working party consisting of the Association of the Personnel of the Food and Veterinary Office and the Department of Education and Science is currently examining all aspects of the establishment of the international annexes. Final decisions will be taken when all the implications have been clarified.</P>
      <P>Children of the countries of the European Union whose parents live and work here on a temporary basis tend to attend schools adjacent to their Irish domicile. In the Dublin area, German and French nationals tend to favour St. Kilian's German School, Clonskeagh, and the Lycee Franco-Irlandais, in Foxrock, County Dublin.</P>

      <P>Resource teacher support is allocated to assist children with special educational needs who are attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis and where such support is necessary to enable the children to function successfully in the integrated setting. The level of support provided in any individual case is determined by reference to the professionally assessed needs of the individual child or children involved.</P>
      <P>All applications for resource teacher support are initially examined by the school's district inspector whose recommendation in each case is forwarded to the relevant senior inspector for final adjudication. Throughout this process, full regard is had to the assessed needs of the individual children.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, I understand an application was received seeking resource teacher support for eight pupils attending the school in question. I further understand that all members of the inspectorate involved in assessing the application were agreed that resource teacher support was only warranted in respect of one of the children mentioned. In the case of that child, an allocation of resource teacher support has been made. The needs of the other children were not considered to be such as to warrant resource teacher intervention. A final decision on the case in question had not been taken when I responded to the Deputy's parliamentary question of 3 October, 2000.</P>
      <P>The school authorities are free to appeal this decision to my Department's special education section. I can assure the Deputy that any such appeal and all documentary evidence supporting the appeal will be given full consideration by officials in my Department.</P>

      <P>I understand that the scholarship in question is one of the Easter week commemoration scholarships. These prestigious awards have been in existence since 1966 and only seven scholarships are awarded annually. One scholarship is awarded for each of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation of Independence.</P>
      <P>The person in question was awarded his Easter week scholarship in 1995. However, the practice of issuing certificates and medals to the successful students, usually at a formal presentation ceremony, was not introduced until 1996. Accordingly, the issuing of a certificate and medal to the person in question, and other award winners prior to 1996, does not arise.</P>
      <P>Easter week commemoration scholarship winners are funded in respect of fees, where applicable, and maintenance to pursue one undergraduate and one postgraduate course as approved under the terms of the scholarship scheme.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a doubling in the value of the Easter week commemoration scholarships in order to give greater recognition to the achievement of the students who, through their performance in the leaving certificate examination, are awarded these scholarships.</P>
      <P>The increase, which is effective for all scholarship holders from the 1999/2000 academic year, means that the higher non-adjacent rate of the scholarship increases from £1,740 to £3,500 and the adjacent rate increases from £726 to £1,500. For the 2000/01 academic year, the rates will attract the 5% increase applied to the third level maintenance grants and, accordingly, the non-adjacent and adjacent rates have increased to £3,675 and £1,575 respectively.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to clarify the existing policy of the Department of Education and Science on such matters. Implicit in the issue which the Deputy has raised is the exploitation of schools, their pupils and parents by companies in pursuit of opportunities to expand their market share. I assure the Deputy that the use of educationally linked promotional activity with such solely commercial motives cannot be condoned under any circumstances and my Department is careful not to endorse any such promotions.</P>
      <P>In the commercial world, private companies are free to promote their businesses in accordance with accepted marketing practices, such as the provision of vouchers which can be redeemed for a variety of purposes. There are also accepted marketing standards, such as compliance with advertising regulations which guide, inform and control the relationship between the vendor and potential customers. I recognise the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotion initiatives linking schools, pupils and parents to commercial activity. However, it would be inappropriate to prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives provided such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of requiring additional expenditure, that children are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects serving national educational initiatives.</P>
      <P>Official circulars were issued by my Department to the management authorities and principals of primary and second level schools concerning the promotion and marketing of commercial products through schools. The circulars noted the Minister's concern at the pressure on schools from time to time to become involved in the marketing and promotion of commercial products.</P>
      <P>The circulars impress on school authorities the need to consider carefully the implication of allowing situations to develop which would result in undue pressure to purchase particular commercial products. It is my policy to request the co-operation of school authorities in taking steps to eliminate any undesirable practices in this regard and in formulating agreed school policies in relation to commercial promotions.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the details of this case.</P>
      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible</P>
      <P>An educational needs questionnaire has been completed by the child's mother to assist with the identification of his educational needs and to provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, on behalf of her child. The advice of my Department's inspectorate is being sought in this case, and every effort is being made to find a suitable school placement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students, which are administered by the local authorities and vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>County Waterford Vocational Education Committee has confirmed to my Department that the student in question has been awarded the full adjacent rate of grant, currently £710, under the third level maintenance grant scheme for trainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants scheme and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to <Col N="759" /> students through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies. I have recently increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>In this regard, if he has not already done so, the student to whom the Deputy refers may wish to contact the student welfare officer in the college attended for further information on the fund.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries while improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the setting up of an action group on access to third level education, with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students in third level education. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by students in three disadvantaged groups &ndash; students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second chance students. I have asked the action group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access, and as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced on 14 September 2000 the introduction of a special maintenance grant, payable to disadvantaged grant holders early in 2001, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. Tentative indications are that in the region of 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education.</P>
      <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to it under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provisions of the Act will be commenced as appropriate. It is envisaged that membership of the designate board would, as far as possible, mirror that of the final board. My Department has requested nominations to the board from the education partners and relevant Government Departments. I will be in a position to establish the designate board once all of these have been received.</P>
      <P>The number of educational welfare officers required for the implementation of the Act will be determined as part of the preparations for the implementation of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to the Deputy's query regarding the specific arrangements for the northside of Dublin, it is my intention that the new educational welfare service will, ultimately, cover the entire country. The service will be implemented on a <Col N="762" /> phased basis, in line with a plan to be developed by the designate board. The priority in the initial stages will be on areas of disadvantage generally.</P>

      <P>The assessment of means for all applicants under the third level student support schemes is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments.</P>
      <P>When assessing income from self-employment and farming, the amount assessed is the adjusted profit/loss for income tax purposes from all self-employment activities, both Irish and foreign, whether or not they are exempted or relieved from Irish income tax. Capital allowances and other capital related costs, such as interest on borrowings used to purchase fixed assets, are not deductible from the adjusted profit in computing reckonable income for grant purposes.</P>
      <P>These means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and are of general application. County Kilkenny VEC, the relevant body charged with the administration of the scheme in this case, has confirmed to my Department that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the prescribed income limit and the candidate in question was, therefore, ineligible for a grant. I have asked the VEC to review this assessment in the light of the information furnished by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms and conditions of the student support schemes are of general application and, <Col N="763" /> accordingly, it is not possible to make exceptions in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes, support is also available to students through my Department's student assistance/access fund.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 894 and 902 together.</P>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil &ndash; £20 per pupil in respect of each service &ndash; subject to a maximum of £20,000 per annum &ndash; maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided.</P>
      <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January this year. Furthermore, with effect from September of this year, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools are receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year <Col N="765" /> to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that the PESP scheme does not discriminate against schools that have increased their student and teacher numbers in recent years, as the increase in the grant rate of 33% that I put in place this year applied to all schools in receipt of PESP grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the original pilot job-sharing scheme for teachers which was introduced in 1993, job-sharing teachers who held or were promoted to A or B posts of responsibility were required to stand down from these posts and forfeit the relevant allowances while job sharing. Following a review of this scheme and consultation with school management and teacher representatives, a new job sharing scheme for teachers was introduced from the 1998-9 school year. It provides that special duties and assistant principal, formerly A and B, post-holders may retain their positions while job sharing, subject to the relevant school management authority being satisfied that the duties of the post can be performed in full by the teacher.</P>
      <P>Following further discussions in the matter, my Department agreed earlier this year to restore the allowance which would have been due to any job-sharing teacher during 1997-8 if the teacher was not required to stand down from a post of responsibility under the terms of the original scheme. This is subject to the condition and understanding that any such teacher was willing and able to carry out the duties appropriate to the post during the period in question.</P>
      <P>A circular on the matter is currently being issued to all school management authorities together with application forms to enable teachers to make the necessary claim for payment of the appropriate allowance. I wish to assure the Deputy that any claims received by my Department will be processed as speedily as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Points System, which was published last December, made recommendations in relation to a wide range of complex issues including lifelong learning, access to third level education for mature students, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and students with disabilities, entry to healthcare courses, the leaving certificate grades and points system and many other topics.</P>
      <P>I support the commission's main recommendation that the points system be retained on the basis that it is well established, is broadly fair and transparent and is generally accepted by the public at large. Since the report was published, consultations have taken place with the Higher Education Authority, third level institutions and other interested parties on an implementation strategy with a view to addressing weaknesses and drawbacks in the present system while retaining its strengths.</P>
      <P>The following are some of the key issues which have been addressed since the report was published. I have established an action group, chaired by Dr. Cormac MacNamara, to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated national framework to promote the participation at third level of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second chance students, building on the experience of current initiatives.</P>
      <P>The group will have specific regard to the objectives on third level access in the national development plan and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, as well as the recommendations of the points commission. The action group held its first meeting on 14 September and has been asked to report within three months.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority has been asked to establish a committee, as recommended by the commission, to explore the issue of introducing a preliminary third level course in life sciences as a prerequisite for entry into the healthcare courses.</P>
      <P>Following careful consideration of the recommendation in the report of the Commission on the Points System that the bonus marks for answering through Irish in the leaving certificate should be abolished, I have decided to retain the present system of awarding bonus marks. In taking this decision, I took account of the wider issues of public policy towards the Irish language, not least the fact that this is a valuable incentive which encourages wider usage of Irish in education and gives due recognition to the extra effort put in by those studying through the medium of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remaining recommendations in relation to higher education are generally the responsibility <Col N="767" /> of third level institutions. I have asked the Higher Education Authority to examine in detail the relevant recommendations of the report. The authority has sought meetings with the representative bodies of the main providers of higher education to discuss the issues involved and the arrangements which should be put in place to progress matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. When assessing the means of students other that mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that these provisions can give rise to difficulties in individual cases and my Department is examining the issues involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about truancy from schools, caused by whatever reason. Due to the link between non-school attendance and early school leaving, my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally-based educational welfare officers, to schools and families, rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the Act provides that when a student is either suspended for longer than six days, or misses more than a cumulative total of 20 days in a school year, or displays what the principal considers to be irregular attendance patterns, the principal shall inform the education welfare officer. This trigger mechanism aims to prevent problems before they emerge, rather than treating the symptoms later.</P>
      <P>However, legislative solutions are not in themselves enough. For that reason it is vitally important that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative was introduced in 1998. One of its key objectives is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. The initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-00. I have decided to extend the existing 17 projects for a further phase, for the period 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched in 58 schools. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to <Col N="771" /> design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. At the end of May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that the curriculum provided in our second level schools meets the needs of all pupils. The leaving certificate applied and the junior certificate schools programme are examples of measures which have a real impact and we need to build further on these.</P>
    <P>Improving school attendance and preventing early school leaving are not simple matters to resolve and, in order to have a real chance of success, the solutions must be wide ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals he has to assess PAYE workers on net pay for the purposes of third level grant; if his attention has been drawn to the hardship caused due to the rise in inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24614/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments.  Any proposal to move to a means assessment system based on net income would have significant financial implications, in addition to equity issues, which would have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase, annually, third level maintenance grants in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the <Col N="774" /> average industrial wage. In line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the maintenance grant and of 5% in the income limits to qualify for a grant, for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
    <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 2000-01 academic year is £20,200. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part-maintenance grant, 50%, in respect of which the income limit is £21,400. Where two or more children, or the candidate's parent, are attending full-time approved third level courses the above income limits may be increased by £2,270 where there are two such children, by £4,540 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,270.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The question of further raising the reckonable income limits could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries while improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the setting up of an action group on access to third level education, with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students in third level education. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by students in three disadvantaged groups &ndash; students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second chance students. I have asked the action group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access, and as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced on 14 September 2000 the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of maintenance grant <Col N="775" /> will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college. Tentative indications are that in the region of 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>

      <P>These projects are being developed on a design, build, finance and operate basis. The competitive process is now under way and private sector bids are due in February next year. The structure of any Exchequer payment for the schools will only be established following a value for money assessment of the bids received. In the PPP process, while the maintenance and operation of the buildings will be a matter for the successful bidder, for the duration of the service contract, normally around 25 years, the management of the schools and their day to day running will remain with the school management authorities. The State will retain legal ownership of all properties.</P>
      <P>The capital cost for the five schools is estimated at a total of £35 million and it is intended that the new schools will be available for September 2002.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he is taking to ensure that a substantial number of schools make their premises available for after school child care if he has assessed whether there are any barriers to the rapid take-up of this, such as insurance for security costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that, where feasible, spare accommodation would be made available for child care purposes by school authorities.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's £40 million anti-inflation package, a total of £7.5 million is being made available to support the development of after school child care in a school setting. This includes: £2.5 million to facilitate minor refurbishment works to make the premises suitable for child care purposes; and £5 million to support the development and management of services that combine educational and recreational elements of child care through the provision of a financial contribution to schools towards additional heating, lighting and insurance costs.</P>
      <P>To ensure an integrated approach, details of the scheme to support schools in this way will be finalised in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an initial step, my Department has undertaken a survey of spare accommodation in all primary and post primary schools. To date 932 primary schools &ndash; 28% &ndash; and 417 post primary schools &ndash; 55% &ndash; have submitted returns. Over 140 schools have indicated that they have spare capacity and are willing to consider use of such capacity for child care purposes while 85 have spare capacity currently being used for other purposes which may have potential use for child care purposes. Detailed follow up on each positive response will be necessary, however, to establish <Col N="778" /> the precise position with regard to individual cases. This will include identification of barriers to rapid take-up which may include insurance.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, an amount of £5 million was provided in the 1999 budget to provide grants to schools that set up and run after school child care services. My Department is currently finalising details of a scheme for an after schools support service in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which has also been allocated £5 million to support community based groups to develop after school child care services in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that my Department's scheme will be confined to schools in disadvantaged areas. In the case of the primary sector, schools will be selected on the basis of criteria developed by the Educational Research Centre for the new more targeted child centred programme being introduced following the survey of all primary schools. Selection at second level would generally be based on retention levels but would include the schools currently being selected for inclusion in the stay-in-school retention initiative.</P>
    <P>Finally, my Department has also provided £2.3 million this year for child care to support access of participants to Youthreach, Traveller Training Centre programmes for early school leavers and the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme for unemployed people. The funds are allocated to the vocational education committees for direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on existing commercial or community crèches and for the payment of childminders subject to compliance with tax and registration requirements under the Child Care Acts.</P>

Information on such options is available by contacting the local VEC, FÁS office or third level college or the Employment Support Offices of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students, which are administered by the local authorities and Vocational Education Committees.</P>
      <P>County Dublin Vocational Education Committee has informed my Department that the person in question has been awarded a full maintenance grant at the non-adjacent rate, currently £1,775, under the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grants scheme and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies. I have recently increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the student to whom the Deputy refers may wish to contact the student welfare officer, or other officer responsible for administering the fund, in the college attended, for further information on the fund.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I previously welcomed the report referred to by the Deputy, which represents a comprehensive review of the funding provisions for second level schools.</P>
      <P>At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements, are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. The Deputy will be aware of the historical anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I draw the attention of the Deputy to my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from September of this year. My approach in establishing this fund is to address <Col N="782" /> deficiencies in the existing funding structures. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for second level schools and I will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

      <Col N="783" /> The figure for staff numbers includes job-sharers and part time staff. The unit cost is based on the full operating costs of the schools, both pay and non-pay expenditure, and includes the salary costs of the teaching staff.</P>
    <P>A significant proportion of those placed in young offender centres would already have a track record of offending. While the centres do <Col N="784" /> not maintain specific tracking systems on the rate of re-offending, a previous analysis indicated that approximately 25% of those admitted to reformatory schools had already been in industrial schools. A survey carried out some years ago indicated that up to 75% of the young people who had been in Trinity House School had subsequently re-offended. This finding is broadly in line with the experience of recidivism rates in other countries.</P>
