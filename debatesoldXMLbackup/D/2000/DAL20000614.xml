      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Howlin and Sargent. I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted notices to my office. I first call on Deputy Howlin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I wish to give notice of my intention to seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the latest official figures from the Central Statistics Office which show year on year inflation running at 5.2% which has effectively cancelled out the benefit of the general social welfare increase announced in the budget and this year's pay element of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; the implications of these figures for our economic development and the future of social partnership; and the need for the Minister for Finance to take urgent corrective measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to suspend the business of the House under Standing Order 31 to demand that the Government address the issue of urgent public importance, namely, the huge increase in inflation as revealed by the latest CSO figures; the continuing inaction by the Government to deal with the consequences of inflation; and the implications for the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 35, Planning and Development Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m. Private Members' business shall be No. 93, Housing Policy: Motion (Resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister for Finance's inflation projections have now been completely discredited, does the Taoiseach intend to meet the ICTU as a matter of urgency to look at the implications for social partnership? Would he also indicate whether, as signalled in the newspapers, he intends to introduce supplementary budget measures regarding social welfare and other direct and indirect tax measures to the House? Would he indicate if that is his intention and when the House will be informed of the proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the strategy outlined in the budget is now in disarray and since the Taoiseach promised a second Finance Bill, will there be a second Social Welfare Bill also? Does he accept that the Minister for Finance, who inherited an inflation rate of 1.5%, has now managed to triple the inflation rate, double the rate of increase in house prices and put social partnership in jeopardy? What specific measures does the Government intend to take to address this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same matter, will the Taoiseach respond to the concerns raised by IMPACT and other trades unions regarding the inflation figures and the implications for their members? Will he take into account the widespread concern there is at the decision to join the monetary union given the effects this is having as the UK is not a member? Would it be possible to address this in the supplementary budget which is being discussed?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> On proposed legislation, will the Finance Bill, which is being mooted but not definitely promised, be introduced before the recess of the Dáil since the figures on inflation have shown that the wage increases have already been wiped out and we cannot wait until the autumn? In that regard, what is the Taoiseach's proposal now that national partnership has been exposed as nothing but a ploy to keep wages down while allowing speculative profits, rents and profits generally to go through the roof at the expense of ordinary working people; and the fact that partnership has been exposed as a sham which benefits only a tiny <Col N="311" /> section of employers, bosses, rack-renting landlords and land speculators?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of important issues must be addressed. Proposals will be issued by Government to deal with housing. There are other areas, such as competition, with which the Government is dealing and with which it will continue to deal. Another issue is certain trades, especially in the services industry, where there have been substantial increases without substantial increases in productivity. Competition and competitiveness is a key issue in this. The House will know that our competitiveness position in OECD terms is now seventh, having increased from 21st, so we have improved our position. However, we will have to continue to deal with these issues.</P>

It has given us the lowest unemployment figures and more stability in the economy than we have ever had. It has given enormous tax cuts and a standard of living and quality of life this country has not had since its foundation. I reject the Deputy's assertion.</P>

Does he also agree that the fundamental problem concerns the supply side of <Col N="313" /> the economy in that there is an inadequate supply of housing and outlets for petrol, drink and other price sensitive products?

In the context of the promised new Finance Bill, will the Taoiseach address the issue of the botched job the Minister for Finance has made in his forecasting of economic developments this year, and does he accept that the halving of capital gains tax was a dramatic mistake which should be reversed?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are addressing the issue of profiteering where people benefit from large increases in prices. I have already cited a number of examples in that area and we have endeavoured to deal with it in a number of ways. Deputy Bruton asked about supply side constraints and clearly they exist. There have been price and wage increases in the services industry in the order of 15% in return for productivity of 1%. That does not match. I have made this point for a number of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say what is being done about it. Despite a very difficult programme, the Government correctly maintains the argument, and most people would agree with it, that wage increases should be kept at the relatively low level of 5.5% so that we do not make the major mistake which was made for decades of getting caught in the spiral of trying to follow price increases with wage increases. We will not do that.</P>

      <P>It will be relevant. The Minister both on Committee Stage and with this amendment has gone some way towards acknowledging the special position of the Gaeltacht in relation to planning and development. However, his amendments relate largely to the development plan and regional planning guidelines and not to the individual planning application. As I stated on Committee Stage, An Bord Pleanála has power to override a development plan. A local authority could have a development plan acknowledging the position of the Gaeltacht and regional planning guidelines that would have the same effect. A planning application for a large housing development, holiday homes and so on, the effect of which could be to dilute the use of the Irish language in a Gaeltacht area, could be turned down by a local authority but could succeed on appeal. I do not believe that what the Minister is doing, welcome as it is, goes far enough.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not have a second shot at this. The Minister spoke about the commission on the Irish language but this Bill will determine the physical developments that will take place in the Gaeltacht and other areas. The impact of development on the Irish language has been severe. Yesterday Deputy McCormack spoke about the spread of suburban Galway. As he pointed out, the only way Galway can expand is to absorb the Gaeltacht areas on its east and west side. It cannot expand to the north because there is a lake nor to the south because there is the sea. Some people on the eastern side of Galway city speak Irish as their daily language but the numbers are diminishing and it is only a matter of time before Carnmore, Castlegar, Menlough and so on where Irish had been spoken will be developed at the rate at which the city is expanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One now has to travel quite a distance west of Galway city before one comes to what one would recognise as a Gaeltacht area. The village of Barna is no longer recognisable as a Gaeltacht village and Spiddal village is just about so. There are people living there, both native to the area and others who moved there, who speak Irish. The spread of development along Cois Fharraige westwards of Galway is gradually absorbing the Gaeltacht areas. There is new development further out. The same is happening in Donegal, Kerry and other Gaeltacht areas though it is not to the same extent in Ring and Rath Cairn. In Galway, Kerry and Donegal there is considerable <Col N="321" /> absorption of Gaeltacht areas by increased development.</P>
    <P>There are two pressures causing this and it is important to recognise them. One is because of the remoteness of Gaeltacht areas they are seen as desirable places in which to live. The irony is it is only a short while ago that they were seen as anything but desirable and the State had to introduce special mechanisms, such as Údarás na Gaeltachta, to encourage development in these areas. There has been a dramatic change particularly as regards housing development. The second pressure comes from within the Gaeltacht itself. The sale of sites is the new cash crop. Those who own land which in the past was not seen as attractive land to farm is now desirable as sites and there is an understandable wish on the part of such landowners to cash in on it. The problem that generates for local people who wish to set up home in the area is they are priced out of the market. If we are serious about preserving the language we need young people to remain living in the areas. Such people grew up with the language. It is the first language they spoke and learned as children but they cannot buy sites in these areas. Gaeltacht areas, where officially we want to preserve the Irish language, are rapidly becoming places where only those who have money can afford to buy sites and settle there and those who grew up and lived there must move into the suburbs.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue for Gaeltacht areas. There is an official policy on preserving the Irish language and Gaeltacht areas. We spend quite an amount of money on it. There is a special Department for it and Údarás na Gaeltacht. There is support for the Irish language through various <Col N="322" /> grants and official speak in many ways yet, at the same time, we are permitting Gaeltacht areas to be developed in ways that effectively undermine them.</P>
    <P>My amendments are essential if we are to protect and preserve the Gaeltacht. They relate directly to individual planning applications. I acknowledge that the Minister's amendments, which relate mainly to the development plan, will improve the position but they are at one remove from dealing with the problem. I want us to deal with it when the planning application is made so an application for a scheme of houses, an individual house or any development in a Gaeltacht area would have to outline the linguistic impact the development would have on the Irish language. In other words, there should be an obligation in the first instance on an applicant to show the development will not have a damaging effect on the language.</P>
    <P>Someone who is native to an area and who submits an application to build a house in Carraroe or any Gaeltacht area would be able to show the development would have a beneficial effect on the language. It is also fine if someone proposes to move in from outside a Gaeltacht area and he or she is able to speak Irish, has a great love of the language or whatever. However, it is a different matter if someone proposes to build a development of holiday homes or whatever which would swarm an area with people who have no interest in or knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>I wish to press this amendment as this is an important issue. Officially at least, the Irish language has always been one of the main concerns of those in public life and this is a critical issue for the future of the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I tabled this amendment is response to an amendment tabled by Deputy Dukes on Committee Stage, which requested that where a development required a discharge licence, that fact should be indicated on the register. The amendment meets the intent of the Deputy's amendment. I cannot accept his amendment which explicitly states that planning authorities have to have regard to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, as they have to have regard to a range of Acts and regulations, including the Air Pollution Acts, the Building Control Act, the Fire Services Act and so on.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 30, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(q) particulars of any certificate granted under section 96,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 95 currently provides that applications for developments of five or fewer houses or for land of less than 0.2 of a hectare are not subject to the requirements of Part V. On Committee Stage I said I would introduce a provision to prevent people trying to avoid the application of Part V by splitting up their land into small allotments or by making multiple applications either individually or in concert with others. In the interest of the equitable operation of Part V, it is essential to have those robust procedures in place to ensure people cannot deliberately avoid their obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 204 which brings in a new section 96 is intended to achieve this. The building of up to four houses or development of housing on land of 0.2 of a hectare or less will be exempt from the requirement to transfer land to the local authority for social housing. To avail of this exemption a person who wishes to obtain permission for the building of up to four houses or up to 0.2 of a hectare of land which is zoned with the social and affordable housing condition will have to obtain an exemption certificate in advance by applying to the planning authority. When applying for this certificate the person will have to swear a statutory declaration stating certain things such as the history of the ownership of the land and whether they have an interest in land in the immediate vicinity to allow the authority to take a view as to whether this is a genuine application or an attempt to avoid the social and affordable housing obligations. This certificate should normally be granted without difficulty but if the authority is of the view that the applicant is trying to avoid the provision of section 95 the certificate may be refused. The planning authority can refuse to grant a person a certificate if, based on the information provided by the person and any other knowledge it has, it believes that a person is trying to avoid the application of the section. If the certificate is refused the applicant may appeal that decision to the Circuit Court and <Col N="326" /> the court will decide whether the authority was right to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a very strict time limit on the period for the authority to make its decision on an application for a certificate of four weeks from application or from receipt of further information, if requested. If the authority does not make its decision in that time, a certificate is granted in default, which is similar to the planning permission procedure.</P>
    <P>The section also introduces major penalties for obtaining certificates fraudulently or for providing false or misleading information or whatever. In addition to the normal penalties set out in the section, the court can revoke the certificate and make the person pay to the planning authority the equivalent of any gain they made by their crime.</P>
    <P>There are a number of consequential amendments. Amendment No. 36 to section 7 provides that particulars of the certificate must be put on the register &ndash; that is important for subsequent conveyancing of the land. Amendment No. 194 to section 95 provides that the application of that section will be subject to the provisions of section 96. I am satisfied that these amendments will achieve our objective of ensuring that the provisions of Part V cannot easily be avoided and, therefore, will operate fairly as between all developers of housing. The twin aims are to counteract any attempts at avoidance of Part V and to ensure a level playing field for developers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to oppose this amendment. However, I wish to make it clear to the Minister that in not opposing the amendment and in not taking up the issues in the other two amendments linked with it, I am not agreeing with the provisions in the Bill that have to do with housing generally. I have tabled a number of amendments to those parts of the Bill. That I am not opposing this amendment is not to be taken as an indication that I will not oppose the later parts. If the Minister is to go ahead with the very ill-advised scheme he intends to bring in for housing in Part V, he will need something like this. If, on the other hand, he were to take wiser counsel and substantially change that scheme, the anti-avoidance provisions would have to be of a different nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I support the provisions in Part V. However, my criticism of Part V, given the size and scale of the housing crisis, is that I do not think the 20% provision for social and affordable housing will be sufficient to meet the need. The Minister acknowledged on Committee Stage that the affordable schemes would apply typically to a couple on a combined income of about £40,000. Given that it is people on that level of income who will have to qualify for affordable housing, clearly 20% land provision will not be sufficient. My second criticism is that the 20% social and affordable housing provision is linked to the adoption of housing strategies by <Col N="327" /> local authorities which will take some time to come to fruition. It will be at least three years before any houses are provided under these measures. Having said that, I support the inclusion of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment and amendment No. 204 in particular &ndash; I ask the Minister to explain it more fully as this is the first time we have seen it, given that it was not before us on Committee Stage &ndash; is, as I understand it, to prevent a situation arising where a landowner or a couple of landowners who divide a plot of land will be exempt if the site is 0.2 hectares &ndash; a half acre of thereabouts &ndash; or if it is for the provision of four or fewer houses. Am I correct in stating that the original provision related to two or fewer houses? Is the number of houses to which the social provision will not apply being increased? Am I right in saying that this amendment will prevent the owner or owners of a site dividing up applications, in other words, if a person owned a site of two hectares and instead of making a single planning application for the two hectares divvied it up in ten different applications, all at 0.2 of a hectare, he would avoid the social housing provision?</P>
      <P>If that is the purpose of the amendment I would support it because obviously we cannot have a situation where there is circumvention of what is intended. Given that I thought the provision applied to two or fewer houses rather than four and since this is a new amendment which we did not have an opportunity to examine in detail on Committee Stage, perhaps the Minister will say if there are any further changes of substance in relation to the social housing provisions of the Bill contained in this amendment, other than the avoidance aspect, which had not been before us on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge what Deputy Dukes has said. He has been consistent in his opposition to Part V. The fact that he is not opposing this amendment does not mean he has changed his mind. I confirm to Deputy Gilmore that there is nothing of substance in this amendment to change the substance of the provisions but the amendments are substantial to prevent avoidance. The Deputy asked about the number of houses. Originally it was five rather than four &ndash; we reduced the number so that if a person wants to build five houses, one of those or its equivalent will come under the social and affordable housing scheme. That is simply a matter of mathematics. I confirm that this does not change the substance of Part V or reduce its power in any way. It ensures there is no loophole to enable a person to avoid the provisions of Part V, which we have gone through so painstakingly.</P>

    <P>This amendment is consequential on the amendment I introduced on Committee Stage concerning quarries.

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 30, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v) a record in summary form of all previous applications relating to this land since 1 October 1964,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I sought to require that the planning register would include a record, in summary form, of all previous applications relating to a site. This amendment proposes that the planning record of a site would be on the planning register and easily accessible. One of the difficulties many people have with the planning register is that it is difficult to trace the planning history of a site. One hears about planning permission being granted for a site, a subsequent planning application being granted for another part, another application being refused, and then a Bord Pleanála hearing about another matter. The tracing of the planning history of sites can be difficult. This amendment proposes that the planning history of a site is recorded on the register. The Minister did not agree with this on Committee Stage. I hope he may have reflected further on this matter which must be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I said the planning register is already a permanent record, in summary form, of the details of all planning applications made since 1964. The Deputy's amendment restates what the register is and, therefore, is not necessary. What the Deputy is trying to achieve is already in the Bill. This amendment may have arisen because the records of some local authorities are not as good as they should be or they have misplaced some registers but there is a legal obligation that the details to which the Deputy referred should be on the plan<Col N="329" /> ning register. Therefore, the amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 30, line 34, to delete &ldquo;offices&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;head office and each district office&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment on Committee Stage in an attempt to ensure all these matters would be more accessible to the public. I had put forward a formulation that the relevant records should be accessible to the public, not only at the headquarters of the planning authority but at its district offices. The Minister had a difficulty with this because in some cases local authorities have district offices for engineering and technical staff which are not necessarily open to the public, which I appreciate. However, many local authorities now have district or regional offices which are accessible to the public and are there to give the public a greater choice of points of contact with the planning or local authority to use various services.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would reflect on a formulation of this because my impression was that he agreed people should be able to gain access to records at local authorities' satellite offices or offices which the Minister has been heard to describe, at the level of ambition as least, as one-stop shops. The Minister has been commended on his work in encouraging local authorities to have more locations where the public can gain access to their services. If that is the case, I do not see why the Minister cannot adopt a measure of this kind. Perhaps the wording in my amendment is not exactly what is required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore supported my amendment on Committee Stage. I wish to bring about a situation where, for example, in the Minister's constituency, a resident of Summerhill would not have to go to Navan to gain access to records if Meath County Council had an office accessible to the public in Summerhill or a resident of Athy in my county would not have to go to Naas to gain access to records if the county council had an office in Athy. In the local authority areas where we still have &ndash; until the Minister perpetrates his violence on the system in the Local Government Bill &ndash; the offices of urban councils or town commissioners, there should be no difficulty, in this information technology age, in providing access to county council records, etc. This could be done through a unit installed at the offices of the local urban district council, town commissioner, or the local town council, as it will be if the Minister has his wicked way in abolishing the boroughs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, a number of local authorities have offices, other than their headquarters, which are accessible to the public and where they can conduct their normal business. My amendment proposes that they would <Col N="330" /> have access to the planning register. The Minister is keen to increase the use of information technology to improve access for the public. I may be wrong but I do not see any amendments in the Minister's name in this series of amendments which go any way towards meeting this concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the thrust of Deputy Dukes's argument about trying to ensure the maximum amount of information is available as conveniently as possible to the public. However, this amendment proposes that the availability of the register at all local authorities offices, district and otherwise, should be a statutory requirement. That is not very practical for a number of reasons, not least of which is that someone would have to physically update the register on a daily basis and transcribe it, by electronic means or otherwise, to the area offices.</P>
      <P>The amendments we made earlier in relation to the use of electronic mail and so on will largely meet the Deputy's general point, with which I do not disagree, about making the information available to as many people as possible. It will mean, in the context of the changes we are making to the planning system, including the electronic formats, that the register will be available to everyone with a computer with Internet access. That will make almost obsolete the need to have copies of the register in each district office.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, with the one-stop-shops, the local area offices and the way in which councils are reorganising their businesses and using electronic means of communication, what he is requiring in this amendment will happen automatically. If it does not, subsection (5)(b) allows a Minister to make regulations to prescribe additional requirements in relation to the availability for inspection by members of the public of the register. Should it be necessary, that can be done by means of regulation or direction, rather than putting a statutory provision in the Bill that could be used at some stage by someone claiming their constitutional or legal rights were interfered with by the local authority because the register was not up to date or whatever.</P>
      <P>I am wary of making it a statutory obligation. However, the spirit of Deputy Dukes' amendment is well recognised in the Bill and under subsection (5)(b) I can expressly prescribe additional requirements if that is necessary. We will keep the situation under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate there is a provision under which the Minister can make extra requirements. However, I am not happy. Not everybody who wants to consult the planning register has a laptop computer and access to the Internet. Subsection (7) deals with the status of copies of the planning register as legal documents without proof of signature and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation will be that the local authority will keep a central planning register. Local authorities are going on-line and are getting information technology. Once that is done, a central <Col N="331" /> planning register will be accessible by electronic means. Local authorities are also increasingly providing outreach offices, so that members of the public who need to contact the local authority for various services do not have to go to its headquarters, which might not suit elderly people, people will limited mobility, people with family commitments who cannot afford the three quarters of an hour it would take to travel to the county seat and so on. Those offices should be equipped to communicate electronically with the head office of the local authority and have access to everything that is accessible in the head office. It is reasonable, when we are requiring this register to be available for inspection at the local authority's office, to also require it to be available for inspection at offices other than the head office. That seems very simple to me to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister has inserted a statutory requirement in the Bill that the register should be accessible at the offices of the local authority. I cannot see how it will create any further problems or complications to extend that statutory authority to cover the outreach offices. I cannot see any problem with the updating. People might grumble if the planning register is not updated immediately. However, I think most citizens who go to consult the register at a local authority office will understand if they are told the matter was sorted out only yesterday and there has not yet been time to enter it in the register. We do not all expect everything to be done immediately, although the Minister is smiling at that.</P>

That does not necessarily have to be the head office but can be any of the offices of the local authority. As functions are devolved, the people in Summerhill will be able to go to Trim to see the planning register for their area. The current wording of the Bill is probably much better than the wording suggested by the Deputy, which would mean it would have to be at the head office and each appropriate district office. There is nothing in the current wording that prevents it being kept at the head office and district offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 32, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the need to integrate the planning and development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the population of the area and with the provision of services to that population;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second and Committee Stages I made the case that our approach to planning is a physical one and that there is a need to integrate the con<Col N="333" /> siderations of people into the process. Social, community and cultural considerations should be taken into account in the planning process.</P>
    <P>One frequently hears at meetings of local authorities and at hearings by An Bord Pleanála that certain considerations cannot be taken into account because they are not planning issues. In other words, issues that affect the people in an area are often excluded from planning considerations because they do not relate to the physicality of the area. One can look at matters such as traffic, car parking, water, sewerage, heights, sightlines, widths and so forth. All types of geometric and geographical considerations can be taken into account but the considerations of people are not always included when planning decisions are being made.</P>
    <P>This section relates to what will be included in the development plan. The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would consider my amendment and return with his own amendment on Report Stage. He has done that and I thank him for it. However, there is a distinction between what is proposed in the Minister's amendment and what I am trying to achieve in mine. The Minister's amendment states: &ldquo;in the context of proper planning and sustainable development of an area, the development of that area socially, economically and culturally&rdquo;. There is a slight difference between that and my objective which is &ldquo;to integrate the planning and development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the population of the area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Spencer Dock development as an example. One can argue that the Spencer Dock development is, in the context of the Minister's amendment, contributing to the development of the area socially and economically. I do not know if it is contributing culturally. However, whether it meets the requirements of the people living in that area is a different matter.</P>
    <P>A development might be proposed for a particular area. It might contribute to the development of that area, as we understand development, and to the economic development of the area. What constitutes social development is a matter of opinion. Some people might say a development will raise the tone of an area and is, therefore, social development. However, that might not meet the requirements of the people living in the area.</P>
    <P>One of our failures in discussing environmental issues, particularly planning, is that we have forgotten about people. We are great for looking at physical things and the impact of development on the physical environment, but we are not as good, and the planning laws do not permit it, at examining development in the social and community context. Look at what is happening in the housing sector at present. Communities are being ripped asunder. In my constituency there is a long history of communities with extensive networks and extended families within the locality, where three generations might live in close proximity. That <Col N="334" /> tradition is being ripped asunder because the new generation cannot afford to buy houses close to their communities.</P>
    <P>A proposed new housing development could be said to be contributing to an area and might pass muster as far as its physical content is concerned. However, whether it contributes to the social integration and community of the area is an entirely different matter. The Minister's amendment goes some way towards meeting my concerns in this regard. It provides that a development plan will have to include some reference to the social, economic and cultural development of an area. However, I am seeking something a little different, that the physical development that occurs in an area be integrated with the social, community and cultural requirements of that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I vividly remember in 1992 asking the then assistant city manager of Dublin Corporation, Mr. Derek Brady, to report back to the committee on how many families had moved into the developments along the quays. The developments enhanced the area physically but one must ask what they did for that part of the city culturally or in terms of enhancing the community. They have made little contribution in that regard.</P>
      <P>The assistant city manager did not return with a report because no families had moved into the developments. One can see the same thing happening in the new developments throughout the city, such as in Ringsend and Charlotte Quay. It is better to have something rather than nothing there but the populations in these areas are transient and separate from the indigenous community. In some cases, there is a Fort Knox type arrangement where large gates are installed in the development. This leads to a certain amount of resentment because local people cannot afford to move into them. They are seen as exclusive. If families and children do not move into a development, there will be no community or integration.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Councillor Ciarán Cuffe, was on the radio programme &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning talking about this phenomenon and contrasting our attitude to planning with attitudes in other parts of continental Europe. In those countries there is provision for families. There is no problem moving families into apartments because it is the norm. In Dublin, however, the idea, which is profit driven, is to put as many apartments as possible into an area and not to provide ancillary facilities. There is, therefore, no provision of crèches, playgrounds or open space. Instead there is high rise development with apartments packed into them. Deputy Gilmore referred to Spencer Dock. The same mistakes will be repeated there. When will we learn? When will we draft planning legislation to address this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning must be about bigger things, it must have vision. Clearly, however, this vision is not encapsulated in this legislation. That is disap<Col N="335" /> pointing and I ask the Minister to look at it again. Yesterday, we discussed sustainable development. The integration of people into planning must be part of sustainable development. If there is no continuity or community, there is no sustainability. There will only be separation. People will move into an area and quickly move out again. The area is simply seen as an investment from which they will move on. As a result they do not care about the area. I am aware of this from personal experience. In the Ringsend area and inner city, these people do not attend residents' associations meetings. They are not interested in the area in which they live. That leads to even more resentment. This issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Although housing has become far more expensive, people still want to live in a house and have a garden, and I can understand that. However, the reason that attitude persists is that living in apartments is most unattractive for families. Look at the developments by Zoe Developments. The angle of the stairs in those buildings is extremely steep. No responsible parent will move their children into that type of development. In addition, the lack of facilities will just encourage them to say: &ldquo;No, I need to get out of here and get a house for my children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I support the amendment. It is an issue we must examine carefully. There must be a responsible attitude to planning. It is not just about the physical nature of the development or about profit. We cannot pander to developers who are simply interested in pushing up their profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a slightly more positive view of the Minister's amendment than do Deputies Gilmore or Gormley. The Bill would be improved enormously if the Minister's amendment and either Deputy Gilmore's amendment or my amendment were adopted. If anything, my amendments Nos. 48 and 96 are slightly narrower in scope than Deputy Gilmore's amendment, therefore, I would not have a huge preference for either amendment. However, something of that nature needs to be included. The reason I am positive about the Minister's amendment is that the reference to the development of that area socially, economically and culturally is an important starting point for a couple of very specific reasons to do with situations in parts of Dublin and Cork in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been reference to Spencer Dock. When the Town Development Bill was debated, I referred to another proposed development on the south side of the river at Ringsend. This is a monstrosity of a development which will have a 36 storey round, glass fronted, tower at one end which, in the absolutely inane blurb which accompanies these matters, is now being presented as a gateway into Dublin. Who needs a gateway into a perfectly attractive port? No one will come up the coast, see this monstrosity and say, &ldquo;Ah, there is the gateway to Dublin, turn to <Col N="336" /> port and go in there.&rdquo;  The stuff these people produce as a justification for their proposals is nonsensical. Spencer Dock and the other proposed development have one thing in common which gets away from the concerns of Deputy Gilmore and me, that is, there is no population in the area at the moment. If we talk about the need to integrate the planning and development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the population of the area, it could be argued there is no population, therefore the requirement does not have to be complied with. Similarly, in relation to my amendment which proposes the promotion of the economic and social integration of disadvantaged groups, it could be argued there is no population in that area of Ringsend, it is currently a wasteland, therefore the requirement is not relevant. The Minister's amendment captures all of this. We must remember we are talking about making a development plan which will cover the whole of the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the Minister, in making his amendment which I accept, accepts one or other of the other amendments to allay our specific concerns in areas such as the Spencer Dock area, where there is already an indigenous population who have been living in the area for generations. That combination would help to avoid some of the worst planning features put forward for these areas. The Spencer Dock development will have a residential component. Deputy Gormley is correct in saying that a big proportion of those who will live in the area will be transients. This means people are going there because it is their first independent residence and they know they will go somewhere else when they settle down. This happens because of the way in which accommodation is built in these areas. I disagree with Deputy Gormley's view about families living in apartments. Families the world over, not just in cities but in quite small towns in many parts of Europe, live happily in well designed apartment blocks surrounded by amenities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason this cannot be replicated in Dublin, Spencer Dock and Ringsend on the south side of the river.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not yet been done because we do not create the kinds of conditions, draw up the kinds of plans or include the kinds of requirements that would oblige people to build these developments. Deputy Gormley is correct because, for example, in the Customs House Dock and all that area apartments are built to suit the requirements of young upwardly mobile people. These are often one bedroom apartments &ndash; not studios anymore because they do not seem to be very profitable &ndash; with reasonable living <Col N="337" /> accommodation, which are suitable for single people or couples. These apartments are largely occupied by lone parents, sometimes with one, two or three children, who are on the local authority housing list. If the local authority does not have a place to house these people, the rent supplement is then paid by the local health board. This results in a constant turnover in the population of the area, with no sense of community. The main objective in life of these people in relation to housing is to get out of the area and find somewhere else to live. We invite this attitude by building that kind of apartment.</P>
      <P>I have not seen studies, but the yuppies or young upwardly mobile market at which these areas were aimed will not go near them anymore because they do not like the company among which they might be living. They may or may not be correct but it is not the kind of group among whom they wish to live. Therefore, the original purpose of the development is lost and the current use of the dwellings adds nothing to the quality of community life in these areas. It is a matter of specifying the kind of development which is allowed in the area. This is why we need to include something like Deputy Gilmore's or my amendment, in addition to the Minister's amendment which is the key that opens up this aspect.</P>
      <P>I will make one other point about these kinds of development which applies in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Galway, Limerick and, I hope, one day in Sligo where there will be development. It is absolutely crazy that in major sites such as Spencer Dock and Ringsend people are encouraged to build offices, conference centres, shopping malls and commercial developments with large numbers of car parking spaces. This will add to the number of people coming from outside the city into these areas in the morning and to the numbers trying to get out of the areas in the evening. In this city there is a movement in in the morning between the centre of the city and the C ring where most of the outward bound lanes are virtually empty most of the time, while they are clogged in the evening and the inner bound lanes are empty. If there was a policy of encouraging more residential development in central areas and pushing commercial development to the periphery, we would get a far better use of our road infrastructure, produce a better market for all types of public transport and produce a good deal more comfort for residents of the city. There is no reason a great many people who are now commuting from 30 or 40 miles away to office developments in the centre of the city should not be able to commute a far lesser distance to office developments on the periphery of the city. This would benefit traffic flows and add to comfort on the periphery and centre of the city.     </P>
      <P>I urge the Minister in addition to his amendment No. 47, which stands perfectly validly alone, to consider adding either Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 43 or my amendment No. 48 to ensure we get the proper steer for the people drawing up the development plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>One would not find too many developers who would accuse me of that.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with the general points made by the Deputies arising from the various amendments. That is why I brought forward amendment No. 47. On Committee Stage there was criticism that the development plan did not provide for social, economic and cultural integration in the proper planning of the local authority area. That is a concern and it is worth noting that while there is validity in the points about mistakes made in the past, some of which have been rectified, it is important to stress that there are many initiatives at local authority level aimed specifically at addressing these issues.</P>
      <P>When drafted originally it was felt that we should not overload the Bill, which concerns physical planning and sustainable development in general, with other issues. However, I accept the argument put forward and we have had a good discussion on it. It is necessary not to lose the focus of the Bill, but, as Deputy Gilmore said, the social, cultural and economic needs of a local community should be central to the development plan and the planning process.</P>
      <P>Various points were made about apartments and urban renewal. It is probably fair to say that mistakes were made. It is also fair to acknowledge that the previous Government examined the type of developments referred to by Deputy Dukes and the urban renewal scheme under the guidance of Deputy McManus and produced a report making various suggestions in relation to future urban renewal schemes on the basis of integrated area plans. The quality of the urban renewal schemes and integrated area plans currently being produced, which take into account fully the issues under discussion, is very welcome.</P>
      <P>People are aware of the legal position in which I find myself in relation to Spencer Dock, but I can talk about the docklands in general. Those who read carefully the master plan for the docklands, as I am sure Deputies have, will know it is much more than just a commercial development. The development has been planned very carefully and it is important that the master plan is put in place and that we have the social integration about which we speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments have taken place in local government which encourage local authorities to take a much more active role in the social, economic and cultural development of their areas. I refer specifically to the county and city development boards which have been given the task of drawing up a social, cultural and economic plan or vision for their areas over the next two years. Work has already started in this regard and I am <Col N="339" /> sure Deputies are aware of the activities in this regard in their constituencies. The Local Government Bill contains specific recognition of the social, cultural and economic plans which the boards will put forward. Local authorities will be obliged to ensure the provisions of the plans are recognised in their development plans. Therefore, there are many positive changes taking place along the lines mentioned by Deputies.</P>
    <P>In an effort to be as all-embracing as possible, I take the point made by some Deputies that my amendment refers to the &ldquo;context of proper planning and sustainable development of an area, the development of that area socially, economically and culturally&rdquo; and that there is no reference to the population of the area. Deputy Gilmore said the word &ldquo;integrate&rdquo; should be included in the amendment, and I propose to withdraw my amendment No. 47 and suggest the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 32, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think this includes all the essential elements referred to by the Deputies &ndash; the concept of integration, the linking of planning and sustainable development with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and the inclusion of a reference to the area and its population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for responding to the debate and congratulate him on redrafting the amendment while on his feet. It captures what I have been seeking to achieve in my amendment, namely, the concept of integration. Issues such as where children will go to school and provision for child care must be addressed if an area is to be developed. Some planning authorities would not allow child care facilities to be developed in residential areas because they considered they would not be in keeping with the area. Manifestly they are. In commercial and industrial developments car parking, canteen facilities and even hotels are provided but often child care facilities are not, even though it is known that children will be living in the area. There is a need to integrate recreational and community amenities as part of the physical planning process to meet the social, community and cultural needs of the population of an area. I thank the Minister for bringing forward the amendment to his amendment which meets what we are seeking to achieve.</P>

      <P>This certainly marks an advance. Mistakes were made in the past and continue to be made. Initially Deputy Dukes misunderstood what I said. What I am saying is that we can have apartment living. Berlin, Barcelona, Rome and Stockholm are examples of where apartment living has been integrated with community and family life but to date it has not been achieved in this city &ndash; I do not know of any examples &ndash; and that is regrettable.</P>
      <P>I hope the initiatives taken in the Bill will prod the planning departments of local authorities and that they will begin to see that they should have a more urbanised vision of what planning is about. All too often the city is seen as a place where one works and one gets out of as quickly as possible. We are moving to a stage where the city is seen as a place where one works, young people buy their first flat and then get out, but we will have to move a stage further where families will live in the city. A person complained recently on the Marian Finucane show that a few years ago we heard about various initiatives under which individuals would live over shops, for example, but nothing was forthcoming, that facilities were not being provided for children in the city and that he, like others, had to get out. This is the wrong direction to take. High density is perhaps the key to sustainability whereby people live in apartments close to good public transport links and facilities for their children. That is the way of the future but to date it has not happened.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage there was a discussion about the need for the development plan to better reflect the requirements of waste management. Section 10(2)(b) provides that the plan must provide for waste services.

      <P>The amendment refers to a waste management plan made in accordance with the Waste Management Act, 1996, under which local authorities can come together to devise a regional plan. This is a reserved function. I seek clarification on what the position would be if one of the parties to a regional plan decided to amend the waste management plan in its functional area. Let me give a concrete example. There are four local authorities in Dublin. If Dublin Corporation decided, for example, to delete from its waste management plan all references to incineration-thermal treatment-recovery, where would the regional plan lie? While it is new ground, what would happen in that instance? What would the consequences be for the development plan and how would it relate to the amendment?</P>

      <P>Waste management plans are a matter for local authorities. It was stated in the policy document, Changing our Ways, that local authorities should deal with waste on a regional rather than an individual basis. On taking office I quickly found that individual local authorities would not be in a position to provide an integrated waste management system on their own because of the volumes involved. Each local authority must, however, have its own waste management plan. If a local authority which is a party to a regional plan decides to drop out, it will still have a responsibility to have a waste management plan for its functional area. This is reinforced by the provisions of the Bill. Nobody will be able to opt out of the obligations imposed under the 1996 Act. The decision which has to be made is whether waste will be dealt with on a regional rather than an individual basis. If a local authority decides to go it alone, it will have to deal with all the waste produced within its functional area.</P>

      <P>In page 32, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the provision by the planning authority of social housing to accommodate, as far as possible, all in need, including, in particular, those on low income and the elderly;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We addressed on Committee Stage this amendment to section 10 which deals with the content of development plans. I wish to address some of the points I raised then and others that I wish to develop now. We would all recognise that the two key and critical areas of responsibility &ndash; roads <Col N="342" /> and housing &ndash; have been the traditional preserve of local authorities and any public analysis or awareness of the roles of local government will focus on those.</P>
    <P>The development plan, both for municipal and county authorities, is a critical document. It lays out the stall of the respective authority in the five year period then before it. The most recent instance in my own areas of experience, cover the period 1999-2004. The failure to refer to social housing in section 10, which addresses the content of the development plan, is alarming. The Minister has stated, and I expect he will state again today, that he addresses this area elsewhere. I do not dispute that. However, I ask him to accept that the omission of social housing from section 10 is open to interpretation. It will feed into a sector of opinion that, at best, will regard it as a very worrying signal. In many cases it will be interpreted as an indicator of the current reality and the future intent of Governments, not necessarily this one alone, regarding the provision of housing by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I know the facts will fly in the face of that fear. When the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, responded yesterday to the Private Members' motion on housing and social housing, which I support, he said investment in local authority and social housing programmes is more than £440 million in the current year. That is a sizeable commitment. Other Deputies and I argue it is not enough, but it is a significant advance on previous figures and commitments to address the housing crisis. It is the intention to provide some 22,000 additional local authority houses over the coming four years. On the basis of the 1999 annual assessment, the need is of the order of 50,000.</P>
    <P>As I did on Committee Stage, I welcome the Government's introduction of the multi-annual allocation to local authorities. That is a very important development and it shows a realisation of the seriousness of the problem and that it must be addressed in new and imaginative ways. Given what I have said, and speaking without any edged address to the Minister, it is imperative to ensure that the development plan reflects the importance of the provision of local authority and social housing within the roles and responsibility of local government.</P>
    <P>In examining any example of development plans the centrality of housing in key and critical areas is evident. I have before me one such plan pertaining to a local authority in my constituency and it appears in three sections, in both the survey and analysis, the implementation and in relation to development control. Housing is a key area in any development plan and any diminution of that reality would be a very retrograde step.</P>
    <P>A consideration of the other areas prescribed by the Minister in section 10 will show that they reflect a broad and realistic view of the areas of responsibility and address that must be included in a development plan. We must also ensure, and enshrine, the commitment of local government as <Col N="343" /> the primary means of addressing the housing needs of the least well off in our society, of those who are socially deprived, economically challenged and, very importantly, of our growing elderly population. The omission of this commitment from section 10 is very worrying and will cause untold disquiet, which will be unnecessary because the Minister will point out that he has made provision and reference to this key area elsewhere in his proposals. I appeal for a common understanding and acceptance of the importance of accepting my amendment, which proposes the insertion of a new paragraph (<i>c</i>) in section 10(2). I will reserve further comment until I hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is important that a commitment to social housing be enshrined in this section. We face the worst housing crisis ever. It affects not only those on low incomes and the elderly, but also those on average incomes. We perhaps need to extend the remit of social housing even further. For example, in traditional working class areas in this city, such as Ringsend, where I live, houses that were available for £50,000 eight years ago are now selling for £200,000, which is way outside the reach of people who live locally. It is an impossible situation.</P>
      <P>Housing lists are getting longer. They comprise people on low incomes and the elderly. Increasing numbers of people are being evicted because landlords want to refurbish their apartments and make a profit. There are loopholes in the housing legislation which allow even for the eviction of sitting tenants. These are going on to the housing list, creating an impossible situation.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for social housing. However, if people are going to move into apartments as part of that programme and if we are going to allocate 20% to social housing &ndash; that was part of the original docklands plan &ndash; amenities must be put in place. Housing and social housing are not merely concerned with physical structures. Much more is involved. The amendment sends out the right signal by making it clear that the problem must be addressed comprehensively.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was getting grief from developers because he is doing a great deal of work in this area. That is fair enough. I hope he can withstand the pressure. In each area &ndash; in Deputy Ó Caoláin's, Deputy Gilmore's, Deputy Dukes's and in mine &ndash; this is now a problem of crisis proportions. We cannot be complacent about it. That is why I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need to say I have great sympathy with the case made by Deputy Ó Caoláin and Deputy Gormley. We have battered at it in this House for the past three years, as has Deputy Gilmore, without getting a great deal of satisfaction from the Government and without getting any satisfaction at all from the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. We would very much like <Col N="344" /> to get to Part V, which deals with housing, in order to discuss it. It covers the issue raised here, as well as others. Since it is proposed in the Bill that a housing strategy should be part of the development plan, it would be much more effective and probably more to the point to discuss it in that context than separately in this context. It is with an anxiety to get to the housing part of the Bill in order that we can deal properly with the issue that I make that remark and not for any other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we get the opportunity of debating the housing part of the Bill on Report Stage because there are a number of things with which we must deal in that part. I support Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment. He proposes that there would be a requirement to include in a development plan a section which deals with &ldquo;the provision by the planning authority of social housing to accommodate, as far as possible, all in need, including, in particular, those on low income and the elderly&rdquo;. A development plan should include that provision. A development plan should state clearly what the local authority intends to do to accommodate all of those in need.</P>
      <P>However, putting it in the development plan and making it happen are two different things and, therefore, while I do not wish to anticipate the Private Members' debate, the proposals the Labour Party has made to deal with the housing crisis currently before the House in Private Members' time are highly relevant to this particular proposal. I agree that it should be inserted in the development plan, but we need to do a great deal more than put it in the development plan. We need to make sure that the land is available to enable local authorities to provide social housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>And even make sure the land is zoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, land being zoned and land being available are two different things; in my local authority, for example, there is a critical shortage of land.</P>
      <P>In addition, we need to make sure that the resources are provided to enable local authorities to provide the housing needed and that local authorities are equipped with the professional and managerial staff capable of advancing house building programmes. I agree that we should put it in the development plan but it will require subsequently a degree of activity in order for it to happen in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this debate on Committee Stage and I dealt with this amendment in great detail at that time. I want to acknowledge the fact that Deputy Ó Caoláin recognised the efforts being made by the Government to try to meet the needs of the people specifically mentioned in his amendment. Nevertheless, as I said to Deputy Ó Caoláin previously, the needs of people who cannot provide housing for them<Col N="345" /> selves, etc., are dealt with fully in section 93 and subsequent sections. I agree with the Deputy that it is important that it should be clear from the Bill that it is important, but inserting it here does not underline one whit more the importance attached to it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 10, with which we are dealing, states:</P>
      <P>(1) A development plan shall set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the development plan and shall consist of a written statement and a plan . . .</P>
      <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a development plan shall include objectives for&ndash;</P>
      <P>The first objective is the zoning of land for a variety of uses, including residential purposes. That is the general rule or regulation regarding a development plan. Residential needs are mentioned at the outset. In a sense residential uses and housing are not omitted.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers here to general objectives, etc. In keeping with its record in trying to tackle the problems which have arisen in the housing market over the past three years, the Government devoted a complete part of the Bill to the provision of social and affordable housing for the people for whom the Deputy expressed concern forcefully here and previously.</P>
      <P>Section 93(1)(a) and (1)(b)(i) and (ii) outlines clearly the idea of the housing strategy, the fact that it must take into account the housing needs of everybody. It also acknowledges that the housing strategy must take into account the most recent housing assessment. Again all the people the Deputy mentioned will be included specifically in that housing needs assessment. Under section 93(3)(b), it must take into account the different levels of income of people looking for housing in the area. It mentions specifically in section 93(3)(c) the necessity to have a mixture of development and the elderly as part of that development and again mentions the aim of counteracting rather than avoiding social segregation in the housing strategy.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Deputy, inserting an amendment in section 10 will not make it any clearer. If people do not have the message at this stage that housing for the people about whom the Deputy has spoken is such a high priority that we will ask local authorities to put housing strategies in place and they will become part of the development plan for that area, and that it must be done within a particular timescale, then I do not think his amendment will convince them or make it any clearer for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the Labour Party's Private Members' motion. At the tail end of Committee Stage I stated, in reference to the critical shortage of land for housing in Deputy Gilmore's local authority area and without wishing to become involved in the deliberative processes of a local authority, that there is land available in that area. Although I may be wrong, it is <Col N="346" /> my understanding that one or two of his party colleagues are preventing discussion on an integrated area plan regarding the provision of housing in that particular area. Therefore if I could see a little more action supporting some of the developments to provide housing and integrated area plans in various places, I would be much more convinced about the bona fides of the Labour Party at a local level &ndash; I am not questioning the Deputy's bona fides.</P>
    <P>The efforts are being made by management of local authorities around the greater Dublin area and, indeed, throughout the country to meet these needs. The Government indicated that the finance is available. We indicated that the necessary staff is available to them, particularly in the planning and development area, although I recognise that many of the local authorities are working below staff quota levels in the area but that is not because the Department or the Government prevented them from recruiting people &ndash; it is one of the constraints of the market at present. We are giving every assistance possible to local authorities to provide the necessary housing. We are doing that, whether that is assistance for local authority housing or the voluntary sector or getting the provisions of this Bill through the House, so that we can initiate the land strategies and obtain land at a reasonable cost to provide houses for the people to whom we refer. It is a priority for the Government. I share the concern of Deputies that these measures be passed as quickly as possible so that the problems faced by many young people are dealt with fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister was not present in the House when I moved the Private Members' motion on behalf of the Labour Party last night. It is wearing a bit thin three years into office for the Minister to try to shift the blame for the housing crisis from himself and the Government to anyone else he can think of. He chooses a different target every week &ndash; it is the builders one week and local authorities the next. He has had a go at banks and, this week, he is having a go at the Labour Party. When one is three years in office, one stops blaming other people for one's failure to deal with a problem.</P>
      <P>The Government now presides over the worst housing crisis in the history of the State. House prices in Dublin have doubled under the Government. Rents in the private rented sector have doubled and the number of people on local authority housing waiting lists has doubled. It is high time the Government stopped blaming others for that, took responsibility for it, apologised to the House for the fact that the policies it has adopted until now have manifestly failed and dealt with the problem. If the Minister addressed the problem rather than taking swipes at everyone else, people would not be waiting years for housing and would not be in a position where they cannot afford to buy or rent.</P>

      <P>In the points made by the Minister on section 10(2)(a) which refers to &ldquo;the zoning of land for the use solely or primarily of particular areas for particular purposes (whether residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, as open space&rdquo; or otherwise, he suggested that the reference to residential goes some way to meet the concerns I expressed. The zoning of land for residential purposes as stated in the section does not meet the requirement of my amendment. Not only that, it does not even address it. That must be patently obvious to all here, including the Minister. My amendment seeks to ensure that a housing authority provides for social housing to accommodate as far as possible all those in need with special emphasis on those on low incomes and the elderly. There is no reference to that critical area of responsibility of local government in this section dealing with development plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Members, I look forward to engaging with the substantive area of the Bill which addresses housing. However, there will clearly be no meeting of minds between the Minister and me and, I suspect, other Deputies, despite the conciliatory approach I adopted in my opening remarks in support of the amendment. I find it <Col N="348" /> beyond understanding that we cannot include a section in the prescriptive section of the Bill dealing with the content of development plans which accommodates the reference to local authority and social housing.</P>
    <P>There is, as I indicated earlier, the potential for misinterpretation. I make an interpretation because I cannot fathom nor understand the resistance and that, therefore, poses questions for me which I have not been able to answer so far. As regards Deputy Gilmore's motion on which I spoke yesterday evening, I reiterate my support for several elements of that motion because it proposes to address critical areas which will impact positively in tackling the crisis we face in this jurisdiction where 50,000 household units seek local authority housing. That fact cannot be disputed and that figure has probably grown since the 1999 assessment of needs.</P>
    <P>I will not rehearse the arguments again because I have already gone through them in some detail on Committee Stage and again here. There is a stoic resistance but I am of the view that the amendment is valid and sound and is required in the Bill. Therefore, I give notice to the Chair and Members that I intend to press my amendment.</P>

There is reference in the section dealing with the content of development plans to the preservation of the character of architectural conservation areas. There may be architecture which will not reach the required standard to be included in such areas but, in its own right, deserves a degree of protection in the development plan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to impose a requirement on planning authorities to include objectives for the conservation and protection of the architectural heritage in the development plan. The amendment is not necessary because these obligations are already set out in paragraphs (e) and (f). Paragraph (e) states:</P>
      <P>the protection of structures or parts of structures which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (f) states:</P>
      <P>The preservation of the character of architecture in conservation areas.</P>
      <P>These paragraphs give specific and comprehensive objectives for protecting structures and areas of special architectural interest and are sufficient to cover the points made by the Deputies. The provisions inserting a new chapter in Part II specifically to deal with this issue strengthens the Bill. On Committee Stage it was suggested that there was an intermediate point between an area that is worth declaring as being of architectural interest and one that is not. It may have been Deputy Gilmore who mentioned a Victorian suburb in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is so well travelled I should have known that. If an area such as that requires special status the local authority should designate it as such. The Bill is not restricted to any particular era. Where an area is designated a higher degree of planning control is required regarding development on the exterior of the buildings. That is as it should be and Deputies would agree with that. What is the effect of having an objective to protect the architectural heri<Col N="351" /> tage in an area that is not designated as such since the higher degree of planning control does not operate automatically?

      <P>This concerns areas covered by the major accidents directive. I do not have a difficulty with the Bill as it stands but there is an aspect that should be taken into account. There are installations that come within the scope of that directive that have been in existence for some time. During that time and before the provisions of the directive came into force developments took place around those sites that would not now be permitted or even proposed. The directive and this Bill allow planning authorities to examine the matter and require changes to be made in the installations that give rise to the problem. In fairness, it should be possible for planning authorities to examine some of the development that has taken place since then that comes within the areas that would be affected by Seveso type flights.</P>
      <P>It may be that some of those developments could be reasonably terminated or altered to bring the whole area within the scope of the directive.</P>

I have no knowledge of how he would have had information on any of the facts. I accepted some of his invitations to perform official openings, including one for Merck Sharp and Dohme, which was a big occasion, and I also accepted one in respect of a renewal scheme in Roscommon when I was on tour there.</P>

      <P>I know that place in Roscommon quite well. I visited it a week before the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will he confirm a point that might be useful to have confirmed? There is a distinction between the gross space of a shopping centre and net retail space and it has been suggested that the ultimate decision would have allowed a larger amount of <Col N="353" /> net retail space than the original decision. Can the Taoiseach confirm there was no change in the decision in the period between Mr. Dunlop's representations and the ultimate confirmation of the decision? If he cannot confirm that now, he might do so at a later point.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the question, but I would be less than honest if I told the Deputy I could confirm that. I will have it checked. As I recall, there was no change, but to be certain I would rather check it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Blair in London on Wednesday evening last, 7 June. We discussed a range of recent developments in Northern Ireland, including the re-establishment of the <Col N="354" /> Executive and the other institutions and the recently published Police Bill. In this latter regard, the Prime Minister is very much aware of our concerns and those of the Nationalist parties and community generally. Our overriding objective must be to have a police service that is representative of both communities and is accepted across all of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I also discussed arrangements for plenary meetings of the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council. I took the opportunity to raise the cases of Pat Finucane and Robert Hamill.</P>
    <P>On Thursday last, 8 June, I met members of the family of Robert Hamill, who died in May 1997 from injuries sustained in a brutal sectarian attack in Portadown. The family members were accompanied by their solicitor, Mr. Barra McGrory, and the director of the committee on the administration of justice, Mr. Martin O'Brien. The Hamill family briefed me on recent developments in the case, including the decision of the Belfast coroner not to hold an inquest into Robert Hamill's death. They expressed the view that only a public independent judicial inquiry could now resolve the issues surrounding the case.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to have the opportunity to meet the Hamill family. The Government has followed this case closely over the past three years. Very serious and unanswered questions have been raised about the role of individual police officers at the time of the attack and the detailed reports we received add to our concerns in this regard. This case is a matter of urgent public interest and the issues of concern involved must be satisfactorily addressed in a manner which will command the confidence of the community. In all the circumstances, I believe that it should be the subject of an independent judicial public inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share completely the Taoiseach's concerns about the circumstances of Robert Hamill's death and the apparent inaction of the Royal Ulster Constabulary on the occasion. Will the Taoiseach indicate what reasons were given by the coroner for being unwilling to undertake an inquest into this case? One would have expected an inquest would be appropriate in a case of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton is probably aware, the coroner issued a very detailed report in this case, which is rather unusual. He makes it clear in the report that he is very dissatisfied with the position in which he finds himself. Mr. Barra McGrory has kept me informed of his discussions with the coroner on this case over quite a long period and he has since made most of that information public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coroner has raised a number of issues. Any fair interpretation of his report would lead one to conclude that the reason he is not stating any more is that he believes that if he draws the people into it whom he could draw into it, they <Col N="355" /> would be subject to dangerous intimidation within their communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>From whom and from which community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can make the assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>From people who are opposed to the ceasefire on the loyalist side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>And maybe people who are not. The coroner finds himself in a position where he obviously has a substantive amount of the information but cannot use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this says some disquieting things about the state of law and order in Northern Ireland in certain areas where people feel they cannot give truthful evidence at an inquest about the death of a fellow citizen. Does the Taoiseach propose to take any other approach in this matter in addition to seeking a full public inquiry, which could take a very long time? Are there other steps he could usefully take with the Executive or the Secretary of State to move this forward as this type of situation has a deeply damaging effect on both communities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. We tried with Barra McGrory, whom you will agree is a very fine member of the legal profession in Northern Ireland, to find ways around it. I would prefer not to say any more. I am at an advantage in that I have read the report of the director of the committee of the administration of justice but I have been asked not to make it public. However, I have been asked to assist in getting a copy of that report to both the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. I think we will wait for some time until they examine it. It is deeply disturbing and certainly not helpful on policing issues generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions for the Taoiseach. Does the Taoiseach still hope to be in a position to recommend to young Nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland that they join the new police force when the Bill, in its amended form, as discussed by him and the British Prime Minister, passes through the Houses of Parliament in Westminster? My second question relates to the murder of Mr. Hamill. Has the Taoiseach raised with the relevant authorities, including the British Prime Minister, the possibility of an inquiry being undertaken with the help of protection for witnesses and the anonymity of witnesses being ensured as has been the case in a number of other circumstances? Did the coroner, Mr. Leckey, make this decision on his own or did he have political guidance, which is extraordinary for a coroner, when he arrived at this political judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="356" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, the Bill is in committee this week in Westminster. Through all the meetings we have had we have made known our concerns about the importance of ensuring that in the end the police service is representative of both communities and accepted across all of Northern Ireland. I do not think we will get all the amendments we wish, following our representations and those of the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Catholic Church and many community and cultural bodies. I hope the central and important ones will be accepted. If the amendments about partnerships are accepted I would passionately like to be positive, because in this one has to be positive or negative, there is no in between. We have to be positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That view is certainly shared by the SDLP who want to be in that position. We have had our meetings. In fairness to the Secretary of State and the British Prime Minister we have had a good audience in explaining in enormous detail the cases and the arguments. I hope the case is taken on board. On the second question, as I understand it Mr. Leckey's report is his own. I know from Barra McGrory that he spent quite a good deal of time reflecting on this issue. He also highlighted that he can go no further on it. His report in itself gives a clear indication of what he thinks about this case. In regard to the protection system, unfortunately I do not think that would carry much weight in the circumstances. Given the dangers, it may not be wise and safe to use it. As Deputy Bruton and Deputy Quinn have said, there is a long delay in these issues. One does not have to study in detail the files or the facts relating to the Pat Finucance case, the Robert Hamill case and the Rosemary Nelson case to be aware of the similarities and the bottom line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not inspire confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, without being unduly critical, those are the facts. I hope the British Government will look not just at the evidence of the coroner but at the compelling facts in the CAJ's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Will the Taoiseach agree that it establishes a dangerous and disturbing precedent that a proper investigation into a crime such as the appalling murder of Robert Hamill could be stymied for fear of intimidation by forces close to those who carried out the crime? Will he agree that in Northern Ireland, where horrific incidents like this take place, the same precedent could be used for not holding a proper investigation into a whole range of disturbing and brutal attacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am sure we all <Col N="357" /> accept that the safety of innocent parties, or maybe not so innocent parties, who would be vulnerable to reprisals will have to be taken into account and one would have to be sensitive about that. Will he agree that a means will have to be found to take care of that while ensuring we come to the truth about the matter of the tragedy on the night in question? Will the Taoiseach agree that members of the RUC were prominently on location and by all accounts deliberately failed to intervene and that a searching inquiry into their role on the night would not now be carried out because of the difficulty raised about witnesses? Did the Taoiseach raise this matter at his most recent meeting with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair and, if so, did the Prime Minister express a view as to how the matter could be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points here. I raised the issue and have also raised it previously. These are very serious matters. Deputies will appreciate that I know most of the facts from the coroner's point of view and I know most of the allegations but the only way they can be resolved at this stage is by a full independent tribunal. I cannot do it. If it was just a matter of intimidation&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very cumbersome. That is a long-term way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A proper inquest is what is required sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be a proper one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty for the coroner is that he felt he could not bring his&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The same difficulty would apply for a public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It could well. Certainly the legal teams believe they will have an opportunity then to put the full facts which they have, the contents of the CAJ report and the evidence they have into the public domain. The coroner could not do that because, as anyone who reads his report will see, it was not just a question of intimidation but the safety of the individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that problem not arise in the public inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the public inquiry, the legal team of Barra McGrory and others will be able to put the facts of this case. The difficulty they have and the coroner had is that it is not just a matter of what allegedly happened. There is no doubt that Robert Hamill was killed but the allegations about who did what and who was there on the night remain allegations. It goes further <Col N="358" /> than that and is about what happened after that night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to ask the same question as Deputy Higgins on precedent. Does the Taoiseach agree that in terms of confidence building, it is difficult to think of a case other than the Hamill case in which some movement towards justice would be more valuable in terms of the relationship of the community with the RUC and law and order? Does he agree that the precedent being created here is so serious that if the coroner cannot hold an inquest, it is up to the British Government to devise a satisfactory substitute? They have previously found ways around road-blocks which have been put in the way usually, and unfortunately, to create the impression that justice was not the objective. Does the Taoiseach agree it is essential to find some way around this roadblock?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was asked by Deputy Quinn about advising republicans and Nationalists to join the new police service. Does he agree this is the acid test? Anything else could make this exercise not worth a candle. This point of view should be constantly emphasised to the British Government. As someone who spoke at the meeting across the road with Les Rogers of the Police Federation, who impressed everyone who attended, does the Taoiseach agree that the contrast between the tone of what he said at that meeting is so different from what he said at the meeting of the Police Federation yesterday, it is a matter of some concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, I agree with Deputy Currie on the policing issue. Getting the policing Bill right and the amendments in place will be a major part of the process. The importance of this has been emphasised by Deputy Currie and others who take a close interest in the matter. We can then go ahead and urge confidence in it.</P>
      <P>I have no more to say on the Robert Hamill case, other than that having read the report, listened to Barra McGrory, met the Hamill family and discussed the matter with the British Government and having had many opportunities to listen to those involved, the circumstances surrounding the murders of Robert Hamill and Pat Finucane, which is a similar case, are profoundly disturbing. The case for a public inquiry in these instances is compelling. There is no other way of dealing with it. We have reached the end of the road as far as the overall process is concerned. The coroner has been very helpful and has done far more than he normally would for a report like this. His difficulty is clear. If we want to see confidence in justice and the rule of law work, a full independent tribunal of inquiry is the only way to deal with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What plans are there for the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council? What is the expected frequency of its meetings? On a related matter, regarding the Taoiseach's <Col N="359" /> meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair, has he discussed with him the prospects of British entry to the euro, given that North-South arrangements are adversely affected by the fact that the Border is one of the few currency borders in western Europe? There are clear issues of national interest to be considered. Obviously, there are some advantages to us if Britain stays out because we can attract investment which might otherwise go to England but there are also considerable disadvantages because of Northern Ireland staying out of the euro. What does the Taoiseach think is best for Irish interests in terms of the likely British decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The various North-South sectoral formats are up and running once again. Nine meetings are scheduled before the Northern Ireland authorities take their break early in July. It has not been decided when a full meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council will take place and whether it will be in July or September. However, all the sectoral meetings will take place before the break or towards the end of July.</P>
      <P>I did not discuss the other matter at last week's meeting but I did on previous occasions. It has always been my view that it is better if everyone, including the British Government, joins the euro &ndash; hopefully the Greeks and Danes will also join. This will assist the stability of the euro. I have no reason to change that view. Whatever the British Prime Minister says formally or informally is the same as he has told me, that if he is Prime Minister in the new administration, he intends to hold a referendum on joining the euro. That still seemed to be his view in his meeting with Prime Minister Aznar this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it will be difficult to promote the level of trade which should be taking place between Newry and Dundalk if a currency risk is involved, while there is no currency risk involved in trade between Newry and London or Dundalk and France? The existence of a currency risk is one of the great inhibitors of trade. The British Government should realise that isolating themselves as a currency island in a large sea constituted by the euro is not in its national interest or the European national interest. There is a convergence of interests here and not the artificial division of interests promoted by ill-informed debate in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. I have said for a long time that they should at least experiment, perhaps using the North, which I accept was not too realistic. When assessments of EMU were carried out in the approach to Maastricht almost a decade ago, currency risk was shown to be the biggest cost barrier to trade in Europe. The cost of currency and exchange is a prohibition against trade and co-operation in many ways. Trade between Dublin and Belfast is only <Col N="360" /> about one third of what it would be if the two cities were located elsewhere in Europe. Anything which is a barrier against trade is not good. The debate in the United Kingdom will continue for some time before a final decision is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I ask you to note that I tabled a question on Northern Ireland for today, seeking a progress report on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, but for some reason it was regarded as repetitious which, considering the number of questions of a similar nature, was strange. Does the Taoiseach accept that unless there is a proper, full investigation into Robert Hamill's death, the implementation of the policing Bill will face a huge hurdle and the acceptability of the police force will be difficult to achieve? Did the Taoiseach raise the question of what the British Prime Minister felt about that matter? Did the British Prime Minister update the Taoiseach on the British view of amendments from various Northern Ireland parties to the policing Bill during their meeting?</P>
      <P>Was the problem relating to symbols and flags discussed? Will the Taoiseach take into account that a three stranded approach might provide some breakthrough in the logjam over that matter, in that strands one, two and three could have different interpretations of where the flags and emblems issue might lie?

      <P>I have already answered the Deputy's question on Robert Hamill's death. In regard to policing, we went through all the amendments, proposals and suggestions that have been put to us by various parties and our conclusions, including which ones I think are more important. They are all important but there are degrees of importance. The policing board, the partnership board, the involvement of the community, the prospect of being able to have inquiries, investigations and look back and the transparency between the NIO security sections and the police authority are the most fundamental ones because they are the long lasting issues.</P>
      <P>We discussed the issue of flags, symbols and emblems. There was a debate on that in the Executive last week. An attempt is being made by the Executive &ndash; I do not know how it will work out but I wish it well &ndash; to try to resolve some of these issues about flag flying days and so on. If agreement could be reached on some of these issues within the precincts of the Executive, that would be the best way to handle it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I will attend the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira, Porto, from 18 to 20 June. This is the second European Council of the Portuguese Presidency, following the Special European Council on Employment which was held in Lisbon last March. While I have not received a formal written communication, as of yet, on the issues to be discussed at Feira, I spoke with Prime Minister Guterres by telephone on Wednesday last. Accordingly, I expect the summit to include discussions on the Presidency report on the intergovernmental conference, an oral report from former President Herzog on progress on the charter of fundamental rights, a follow-on report on implementation of the Helsinki conclusions on European security and defence and a range of economic issues, including follow-up on the Lisbon Summit, Greek entry to EMU and the outstanding tax package. I would also expect the European Council to consider a number of external relations matters including Russia, the Balkans and the current situation in the Middle East. While not mentioned as a formal item for discussion, I would expect the situation with regard to Austria to be among the issues for discussion during the course of the summit.</P>

      <P>In regard to Question No. 10, following the reports that Austria may hold a referendum on its attitude to the EU and its enlargement, has the Taoiseach given any further thought to Ireland unilaterally ending our role in the sanctions against Austria? What is the litmus test for Austria at this point, given that I am not aware of anybody who can say Austria is in any way breaking any EU law or the spirit of any such law?</P>
      <P>In regard to Question No. 11, I understand the arming of an EU police force to be deployed in different ways throughout the world is to be discussed in Portugal. Would this represent the formation of a new armed police force in Ireland? Is Ireland to take part in this development? Will this development be UN mandated? How will it differ in its deployment from the deployment of a military force, given that it is being called a police force?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the 14 have no <i>locus standi</i> in this matter? They just happen to be 14 members of a 15 member club, which is known as the European Union. The European Union rules do not provide for 14 members to impose sanctions on the fifteenth. There is no provision for that. The only way that can be done is not collectively but individually. However, if it is done individually, these sanctions can equally be reversed individually.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is entirely wrong, both in policy and in law, in claiming he must act collectively in this matter. He can and should make up his own mind on whether it is justified to sanction a country and refuse to receive that country's ambassador, simply because of a party that happens to be in the government of that country, without regard to the actual policies being pursued by that government. The Irish Government has no expressed objection to any of the policies being pursued by the government in question and has no basis, therefore, for its continued sanctions. The Taoiseach's party has prided itself on its willingness to take an independent stand on foreign policy matters. It also takes pride in the fact that Ireland is a neutral country and can, therefore, be somewhat superior to the rest of the EU which is supposedly polluted by participation in a military alliance. This is a case on which Ireland could take an independent stance but it has not done so. It is hiding behind this entirely bogus collective notion&mdash;</P>

      <P>Technical conservation measures are an integral part of the Common Fisheries Policy and are designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fish stocks by conserving and pro<Col N="367" /> tecting juvenile and undersize fish. EU conservation regulations prescribe, among other measures, minimum mesh sizes for fixed and towed gear which may be used in various fisheries as well as landing sizes of fish and shellfish.</P>
      <P>I am aware of allegations that certain fishing vessels operating off the south-west coast are using gear which does not conform with the EU technical conservation regulations. I assure the Deputy that I take a very serious view of the matter. Illegal fishing of this nature is detrimental to the conservation of fish stocks which is already under pressure. My Department has, therefore, requested the Naval Service to be highly vigilant in relation to checking fishing gear during boardings of fishing vessels at sea. My Department's sea fisheries officers are intensifying their port based inspections of nets and gear of fishing vessels for compliance with conservation regulations. The Deputy can be assured that appropriate action will follow in every case where illegal gear is found to be in use.</P>
      <P>I have already underlined to Commissioner Fischler the need for enhanced EU conservation measures over and above those already in place. Greater protection for undersized and juvenile fish stocks is required. With the support of the Irish fishing industry and backed up by the work of the CFP strategy group on technical conservation, I will continue to press the case in the coming months. In the meantime, ensuring and enforcing compliance with existing conservation measures will continue to be a key priority for our fishery protection services.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the past year there has been extensive use of Castletownbere port by foreign fishing trawlers when approximately 300 of them called at the port? There is extreme concern among the fishing community in Castletownbere that the vessels are using under sized mesh measuring 90 millimetres as opposed to 120 millimetres. Will the Minister indicate what can be done in relation to the size of the nets these vessels are using which can be proven on landing, though they cannot be physically caught at sea? Will he clarify the reaction of his Department to a complaint raised some weeks ago concerning a 150 feet French steel trawler off the 12 mile zone? This trawler intimidated wooden trawlers of up to 70 feet from the Castletownbere area and was using gill nets up to 12 miles long. How seriously do we take this type of incident given that the French trawler was allowed to get away? Interestingly, the trawler called the <i>Magdalene</i> was arrested and brought to Castletownbere today for fishing with these types of nets. Can I take it on the basis of the Minister's reply that there will be increased vigilance by the Naval Service in ensuring many more arrests where this type of intimidation takes place and where under sized fish are being caught by these trawlers?</P>

      <P>In the first instance, there is no evidence to date of the allegation made by the Deputy. Fishermen in the south and west have made allegations that certain foreign vessels are fishing with nets which do not comply with EU regulations. Checking of gear type is a standard practice of inspections by the Naval Service and the Department's fishery control staff. There have not been significant instances of the use of illegal gear by foreign fishing vessels in the recent past. However, as the Deputy said, there have been some developments recently and I will ask both the Naval Service and my sea fishery officers to increase their surveillance in response to the point made. The type of illegal operation with nets or the type of incident to which the Deputy referred cannot be accepted and I will do my best to stamp it out.</P>

      <P>Can fishery control officers take action within a port if the mesh size of nets on board vessels can be physically seen and do not conform to recognised EU standards? I am aware vessels can be boarded at sea if it can be proven they are catching undersized fish. Obviously the Naval Service have detention in mind in this type of situation and can take these vessels ashore to prosecute them. If it is proven that nets are on board a vessel, can the fishery control officers take action by impounding the vessel or the nets or can they take action against the vessel itself?</P>

      <Quest>when a decision will be made as to whether the gas find in the Corrib field will be declared commercial; the independent information available to him as to the extent of the find; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect Enterprise Oil and its partners to be in a position to decide on the commercial viability of the Corrib field in December of this year. The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of the wells, market availability and price and the cost of the development. The size of gas accumulation is being assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further appraisal drilling aimed at firming up on reservoir volumes is currently being undertaken. If the results are such that the company <Col N="369" /> can establish that the field is commercial, Enterprise Oil will apply to me forthwith for a petroleum lease with a view to its development. Should the field be declared commercial, I understand from the company that it would be its intention to have the field in production by early 2003.</P>
    <P>All data and information relating to the field are submitted on an ongoing basis by the company to my Department. This data is analysed by my Department using in-house expertise in conjunction with consultants. The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with this assessment is commercially sensitive and, therefore, must remain confidential. However, I should point out that Enterprise Oil is reported as saying that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of more than one trillion cubic feet of gas. This compares to more than 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas produced to date from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields. As I have already stated, it is too early at this stage to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensee will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister that as far back as 1988 it was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> that his Department was saying it would be a highly commercial activity and that it would effectively produce 63 million cubic feet of gas per day, which is very substantial. The company has had meetings and consultations, yet we are not in a position to say independently what the facts are. I suspect there may be an attempt by the company to under-sell it at this stage because much of the activity in relation to the gas find will find its way into the public sector. Has the Minister any plans to have this issue examined independently because it will be mainly public money which will be used for the development process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has first-hand information from the company on the progress being made in the drilling programme. We are extremely lucky to have top class expertise available in the Department and we are benefiting from the expertise of consultants who continue to evaluate the information being made available by the company. I am quite satisfied we are being kept fully informed about what is happening in the drilling process which is currently taking place and that it is not necessary to engage independent consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather strange that discussions have been taking place in the State and semi-State sector on this huge gas find while at the same time the company is throwing cold water on it and playing it down. Is the Minister satisfied the company is not doing this for purely commercial reasons? In his initial reply the Minister stated it is a very sensitive matter, which I understand. I have no doubt he has the expertise in his Department, but is he satisfied the experts and officials in the Department are receiving the accurate and <Col N="370" /> up to date assessment figures being produced and examined by the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department receives the same information at the same time as company headquarters in London. There is no question but that we are receiving the accurate information the company is receiving. Regarding the commerciality of the find, the Deputy is correct in saying the company announced a significant gas find two years ago. However, it has not yet declared that find to be commercial. The appraisal wells being drilled will establish the commerciality or otherwise of the field. It is important to point out that this is an extremely difficult location, some 37 or 38 miles off the coast. Clearly, the company must be sure of the commerciality of the find. The Deputy is correct in saying tentative investigations have been carried out. However, until such time as the company is in a position to establish commerciality from its appraisal wells, there is no point in anyone thinking further ahead.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the status of the mid-term report on the multi-annual guidance programme recommending a 10% reduction in the Irish fishing fleet; and the strategy he will adopt to ensure the recommended cuts are not considered, which would be to the detriment of the Irish fishing industry.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16781/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council decision in 1997 on the multi-annual guidance programme required the Commission to present a mid-term report. The report is required to address the state and evolution of fish stocks based on the most recent scientific advice available. It is also required to assess the impact of fleet programmes as well as conservation, control and other policy measures on the state of the resources and on the sector.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledges that the expert committee, STECF, found no evidence that stocks had in general deteriorated or improved since the adoption of MAGP IV. The committee was therefore unable to comment on whether MAGP IV has had any influence on the status of stocks. Nevertheless, the Commission's report asserts that the current exploitation rate of stocks in European waters is too high and that there is a large problem of over capacity in the EU fleet. On this basis, the Commission's report deems the reductions set under MAGP IV to be inadequate in purely structural policy terms as opposed to impact on fisheries resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's report suggests that the programme be radically rewritten and extended to the end of 2002. The Commission wants to return to the large fleet cuts rejected by Council in 1997. It also wants to redesign the system to require that all fishing effort reductions are achieved through capacity rather than activity reductions. This approach would lead to significant capacity <Col N="371" /> reductions in the short term for the Irish fleet, particularly in the pelagic sector.</P>
    <P>The Commission's report does not as yet have the status of formal proposals. The Commission will have to submit a formal proposal for Council decision if it intends to proceed. This would fall to be considered during the French Presidency and a prolonged and difficult debate could be expected.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler will present the report to Council next Friday, 16 June. I will spell out in debate my fundamental views on the flawed assumptions, limited analysis and unacceptable conclusions of the report.</P>
    <P>I will also meet the incoming French Presidency in Dublin over the weekend to exchange views on the way forward. I expect him to agree that the Commission's report is not the way forward. MAGP IV should run its course. What is needed is an objective and detailed debate on EU fleet policy, backed up by comprehensive analysis of the impact of all the policy measures at our disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Franz Fischler says we have to reduce our fleet at sea because of over capacity. The Commission's proposals are to reduce the Irish fishing fleet by 11.2% and to reduce the Spanish fleet by 3.6%. How can the Spanish fleet with 26,000 vessels be equated with the Irish fleet which has 2,300 vessels? This proposal will have to be fought tooth and nail on the basis of being unrealistic. Our quotas are very much undermined on an ongoing basis. I entirely support the Minister's stance on these draconian proposals which would equate with taking about 250 trawlers out of circulation and which would have a profound impact in terms of employment in our ports and in downstream activities. It would take at least 1,000 fishermen out of the sector as well as other people in the processing industry. I hope the Minister will tell the Commission this is totally unrealistic.</P>
      <P>Franz Fischler represents Austria, which has no fishing fleet. His proposals should be based on reality. Ireland certainly deserves a fairer deal than what we have been getting at EU level in the past.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the information gathered by a delegation, headed by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, which went to Chile on a fact finding mission on the salmon farming industry; and the way in which these ideas will further the development of the salmon farming industry in Ireland.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12685/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish farmed salmon is already a recognised quality product with a competitive edge in the marketplace. The challenge now is to build on the potential for sustainable expansion of the sector. The Minister of State headed the fact finding mission to Chile last year to assess the progress made there in the salmon farming sector. The Chilean salmonid farming industry has many similarities with the Irish industry and produces Atlantic salmon, Pacific salmon and rainbow trout. The salmon industry in Chile is a relative newcomer but in just ten years its production levels have increased dramatically and Chilean production is now second only to Norway. Total salmon production reached 215,000 tonnes last year and output is largely exported to the US and Japan.</P>
      <P>The Irish salmon farming industry produces around 18,000 tonnes valued at £46 million with 75% of production exported to EU and international markets. The visit entailed a wide-ranging assessment of all stages of the Chilean salmon farming industry, as well as the policy, regulatory and research frameworks. The objective was to gain an understanding of the key success factors in the rapid sustainable development of aquaculture in Chile and to see whether that experience can be applied in the Irish context.</P>
      <P>The Irish delegation visited coastal communities where salmon farming has transformed areas of high unemployment with jobs and growth. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, also had detailed discussions with his Chilean counterpart and with key players in the industry. There are well established links between the Irish and Chilean industry with significant salmon ova export trade to Chile from Ireland. Salmon cages have also been designed and manufactured in Chile under licence from an Irish company.</P>
      <P>Salmon processing plants were particularly interesting. A key feature of Chilean production is the level of value added achieved. Most of our farmed salmon is exported in whole or nearly whole form. The Chileans by contrast, who are geographically remote from their main markets in the USA, Japan and Asia, market their fish as added value fillets, steaks and other cuts of frozen and fresh fish. More than 15% of its salmon is exported in value added forms which allow for higher economic returns. While the whole fresh market will continue to be a vitally important one for Irish producers, opportunities for expanding the value added side must be systematically developed and we can learn from Chile in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Backed up by significant funding support under the national development plan, a new strategic framework for aquaculture development is being put in place. The Circa report into the future of Irish aquaculture which was launched last week provides the basis for these <Col N="373" /> new directions. The strategic objectives are to achieve critical mass and increase value added in production, diversification into new species, best practice in line with stringent environmental guidelines and high standards of quality assurance. These will be critical to Irish success in the highly competitive market for top quality seafood products worldwide.</P>

      <P>While I congratulate the Minister on his exotic trips to Chile on behalf of the salmon farming sector and to New Zealand on behalf of the mussel farming sector, I still cannot comprehend what effect they will have on either sector. We are surrounded by the north Atlantic in which the quality of fish is unique. The quality of fish in the south Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean does not compare. We could set a headline for the Chileans and New Zealanders to emulate by managing our mariculture and aquaculture sectors properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister committed to supporting them? Will he discern whether we can increase our exports of salmon cuts and aquaculture products to European and world markets, particularly the Far East, through more sophisticated marketing? What steps have been taken to explore the Chinese market? I know the Minister is new to the Department but the least that I expect from him is a commitment to promote and expand the mariculture and aquaculture sectors and to generate the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that a more sophisticated approach is required to the processing and marketing of our seafood right across the spectrum, not just aquaculture and shellfish. My top priority is to improve this aspect considerably. It was useful to learn how the Chilean industry has expanded over such a short space of time. It has been very successful in adding value and exporting product to Japan and the United States through sophisticated marketing and packaging methods.</P>
      <P>The salmon farming sector has significant potential. We are only producing 18,000 tonnes of farmed salmon. This compares with a figure of 100,000 tonnes for the Scots, 215,000 tonnes for the Chileans and almost 500,000 tonnes for the Norwegians. If the new technology now coming on stream proves successful and lessens the impact on the environment we should aim to increase the projected figure of 35,000 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes in coming years. There is no reason this cannot be achieved now that we have passed through one of the big bottlenecks in dealing with the difficult issue of licensing.</P>

      <P>BIM and seafood exporters have been actively pursuing seafood market opportunities in eastern Europe and China in recent years. They are very different markets requiring specific strategies and work in both is continuing with a view to maximising opportunities for the Irish sector.</P>
      <P>I have asked BIM and the Department as a priority to review and enhance seafood marketing strategies and capability. Seafood exports are now worth around £250 million per annum. We need to position the sector to capitalise further on the buoyant international seafood market for quality value added fish products. Fundamental changes are ongoing in the seafood market at trade, retail, catering and consumer level. These changes, with changes in fish supply, will determine the direction of Irish seafood processing and marketing in the next decade.</P>
      <P>The current consultancy review of the fish processing sector will inform strategies for its future development. The new marketing strategy which will be developed in light of this review will be critical to success. I have asked for a full assessment of seafood market opportunities and challenges at home and abroad. This will inform strategies to secure the highest sustainable added value and returns at all points in the chain. The necessary funding support for seafood marketing has been secured under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>I have recently clarified and agreed with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development the respective roles of BIM and Bord Bia in relation to seafood exports and marketing. Under the agreed strategic relationship BIM retains the specialist marketing focus as the integrated development agency for the seafood sector. Bord Bia will have an ongoing role in terms of incorporating seafood into food promotion and trade activities overseas working with BIM. BIM will continue to work closely with Enterprise Ireland whose overseas work in eastern Europe, the Far East and elsewhere provides important contacts and services.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct with regard to the processing side. The processing industry is small and disparate. It needs to be fundamentally restructured.

      <P>In the recent past there has been an increase in the number of incidents between Irish and foreign fishing vessels, particularly off the south west coast &ndash; those Cork fellows again &ndash; and an increase in the number of complaints of intimidation and harassment from fishermen. In excess of 50 such incidents have been reported to my Department over a five year period. A <Col N="377" /> detailed review of these incidents has been undertaken and while it is accepted that there were genuine cases of accidental collisions due, in the main, to failure to keep a proper look-out, poor navigational practice and unattended bridge areas, the majority of the incidents which had occurred involved vessels protecting, or trying to protect, their own fishing gear.</P>
      <P>I will bring legislative proposals to Government in the very near future to deal with incidents between fishing vessels at sea. These proposals, which are in the course of preparation, involve the giving of powers of arrest to the naval authorities in circumstances where a vessel is suspected of having caused malicious damage to another vessel or its gear. Such powers will, it is envisaged, apply within the 12 mile limit and on the high seas within the 200 mile limit.</P>
      <P>The proposal for new legislation follows detailed analysis by my Department, with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Foreign Affairs, of the adequacy of existing legislative powers of the State under fisheries, maritime safety and international legal codes. This has included the commissioning of an independent report from a major authority in the field of international maritime law, in-depth analysis by the Attorney General's office, the preparation of a technical report by my Department working with BIM and the Naval Service and, more recently, the receipt of senior counsel advice and the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The objective of the proposed new legislation is to provide a framework in Irish law to deal with cases of harassment and intimidation at sea. The proposals are based on the piracy provisions of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention 1982.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with our naval resources? When does he expect the proposed legislation to counteract piracy at sea within a 200 mile zone to be ready? The Taoiseach indicated it may be ready before December. It was originally promised for the end of April. Is the Minister satisfied we have the necessary resources to effectively implement the legislation when it is enacted?</P>

      <P>Given that we have such a huge area of sea to protect, nobody could be happy that we have the ability to protect it as effectively as we would all like. While the Naval Service and the Air Corps are doing a good job, it is fair to say that, given the great demands for adequate fishery protection, we would like to see a far more efficient job done. I am satisfied that a good job is being done in the circumstances. There are proposals to improve on that and the impending legislation will give the necessary additional powers to the Naval Service and the Air Corps to deal more effectively with these kinds of incidents. The preparation of the legislation is proceeding apace. I am not aware of any time in the past when so much legislation was introduced to the <Col N="378" /> House or was in the course of advanced preparation as has been the case in the past few months.</P>

      <P>The State has powers to arrest vessels only inside the 12 mile limit and outside of this the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea applies, including the rights of free passage. There is, therefore, a need to put in place this legal framework to deal with incidents of harassment and intimidation committed in the maritime area.

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, in line with Commissioner Fischler's undertaking to me, the Commission has convened a meeting of specialist representatives of member states involved in the relevant pelagic fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting will take place in Brussels on 11 July and will consider all aspects of control in the mackerel and other pelagic fisheries, including the scope for placing observers on boats. This is a welcome development and I assure the Deputy that the Irish representatives will press the case <Col N="380" /> for an observer programme for the larger vessels in the EU pelagic fleet. I share the concerns the Irish fishing industry has expressed about high-grading and discarding on large pelagic boats and will continue to press for action to get to grips with this.</P>
    <P>The presence of independent observers, as the Canadian experience has shown, can play a critical role in deterring potential conservation breaches such as discarding high grades and misreporting. I will take the opportunity to review the Canadian experience with the Canadian Fisheries Minister next week.</P>
    <P>I will keep in touch with Commissioner Fischler on developments. I also discussed my concerns with my Dutch counterpart, Mr. Faber, during our bilateral meeting last month.</P>
    <P>I want to see progress in this area. I am encouraged that the Commission is responding positively to my concerns. I will press for tangible co-operation from the other member states concerned.

Will he indicate from where the manpower for these observers will be drawn? Will they be drawn from Ireland or other EU member states? I assume there will not be observers on every boat every day. What will be the criteria on board ships to implement this policing policy? I am satisfied that this will be a major step forward in improving the mackerel stock in the future.</P>

      <P>Complaints have been made by <Col N="381" /> fishermen who use other types of gear, about alleged damage to fishing grounds caused by vessels which engage in beam trawling. These criticisms are rejected by the beam trawling sector. In the interests of better co-operation between Irish fishermen using different types of gear in shared fisheries, my Department has encouraged dialogue between beam trawler owners and other fishermen. We will continue to facilitate further discussions.</P>
      <P>As I have previously advised the Deputy, there are six vessels in the dedicated beam trawler segment of the Irish fishing fleet. There are also a number of vessels in the polyvalent segment of the fleet which are not precluded from fishing by means of beam trawls, or which are permitted to engage in beam trawling for a proportion of their fishing time. Quantification of the number of such vessels is under way in my Department as part of a comprehensive analysis of beam trawl entitlements within the polyvalent segment. This analysis has proved more complex and time consuming than anticipated originally, but the aim is to complete the work by September and we will provide the Deputy with comprehensive information at that stage.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that there seems to be no urgency on his part or on the part of his Department in dealing with this problem; as a consequence of this problem the fishing grounds in the south-west are being damaged; and there is a suspicion in the south-west that there is a conspiracy afoot because there are supposed to be only six beam trawlers licensed in Ireland and yet upwards of 30 beam trawlers, all of which are from the south-east, have been recorded fishing in the south-west? Has it anything to do with the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, is from the south-east? Will he accept that there is an urgent need to deal with this problem to ensure that what amounts to wholesale illegal fishing approved and sanctioned, if not officially, unofficially by the Minister of State from the south-west is not taking place?</P>

I asked my Department to come up with the details of that analysis as quickly as possible in order that we can take decisions. I will be happy to discuss this matter with the Deputy at that stage.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that his answer is totally unacceptable to the fishermen of the south-west? Earlier this year I was told that this analysis would be completed by <Col N="382" /> mid-June. Where is the analysis? Does he accept that the analysis is simple? There are six boats with licences to fish by means of beam trawls. We must accept that. How can he accept upwards of 30 boats from the south-east rampaging in the south-west and causing damage to the fishing grounds because they are beam trawling? On what basis are they allowed to do so other than that they come from the Minister of State's constituency? Will the Minister agree that ducks and drakes are being played with the law in this regard and it is entirely unfair to the fishermen of the south-west that their fishing grounds are invaded and damaged by people acting illegally with beam trawls without any sanction other than what appears to be unofficial sanction from the Minister or the Minister of State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my response to previous questions from the Deputy, the fishing activities in which a fishing boat may engage are determined in accordance with the terms of licences issued under section 222(1)(<i>b</i>) of the 1959 Act. Certain vessels in the polyvalent segment of the fleet are not precluded by the terms of their sea fishing licences from fishing by means of beam trawls or they are permitted to engage in beam trawling for a portion of their fishing time. These vessels were considered more appropriate for inclusion in the polyvalent segment given the nature and pattern of their fishing activities.</P>

    <P>I assure the Deputy that full consideration was given to the coastal protection needs of all coastal <Col N="383" /> counties, including County Cork, in drawing up the programme for 2000. The main priority scheme identified by Cork County Council is at The Warren, Rosscarbery. Given the need for further detailed scientific investigations before this project could proceed, it would have been premature to allocate further funding to the project at this stage. The position will, however, be kept under close review in light of the situation at Rosscarbery and the overall progress of projects generally under the 2000 programme. I will continue to keep the priorities of Cork County Council in mind in the context of future coastal protection funding decisions, including Youghal and Barleycove where funding was made available in 1999, as well as Rosscarbery.</P>

      <P>Much of the problem with the Cork coastline is that the homework has not been done. I examined Youghal which Deputy Stanton mentioned and we commissioned a coastal protection programme last year in respect of a study of the protection needs of Youghal and paid £40,000 for it. We still await the results of that study which are not available yet. Other locations mentioned were found not to have the urgency and priority of other areas around the coastline which were chosen. Consequently, we were not in a position to provide west Cork with an allocation of money on this occasion.</P>
      <P>We will be happy to re-examine the Rosscarbery situation and I have told the local community there, following the strong representations which I received from Youghal, that we would be interested and anxious. The west Cork Deputies' colleague, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, who brought me to Rosscarbery, was anxious that we examine the situation there with a view to doing something. I will be glad to visit Sheep's Head and other places with Deputy Sheehan when I am next in west Cork.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 111:</P>
      <P>In page 50, line 44, to delete &ldquo;on payment of the prescribed fee and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the Minister's proposal to introduce a fee. It requires people making submissions or observations to a planning authority about a planning application to pay a fee. He indicated previously that this fee will be made by way of regulation and it is generally accepted that it will be a fee of £20 or thereabouts.</P>
      <P>I regard this proposed fee as fundamentally undemocratic. The planning system is there for the public, it is a public system. The whole basis of our planning system is to enable the public to have access to that system and to enable it to make its point of view known. For example, the reason we require planning applicants to put a notice on a site and place an advertisement in newspapers stating that they intend to make an application, that planning decisions are not decided immediately and that there is a period of two months within which members of the public can make their observations known, inspect the planning file and make submissions to it is precisely to give the public an opportunity to have its say on planning applications. If somebody, for example, has an objection to a particular planning application, he or she has a democratic right under our planning system to make his or her point of view known, to state it to the local authority and to have it taken into account when a decision is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister proposes to do here is to require people to pay £20 each time they write to their county council or local corporation about a planning application. If a citizen has a concern about a planning application and wants to lodge an objection to it, he or she must accompany that <Col N="388" /> objection with a cheque for £20. Each time a residents' association wants to make its point of view about a planning application known &ndash; some residents' associations will do this in regard to several applications which are of concern to their community &ndash; it will have to submit a cheque for £20 for each application. That is undemocratic. It is standing the rights we now have to participate publicly and openly in the planning process on their head and it should not be included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This measure is strongly opposed by residents' associations, citizens and even the professionals in the planning system. The Irish Planning Institute, for example, has come out very strongly against this proposal. It is one which should not be included in the Bill. The amendment I propose, along with Deputy Dukes and Deputy Ó Caoláin, is to excise that provision from the Bill and restore the position we have now, that is, that a citizen can express his or her point of view without having to accompany it with a cheque when writing to the county council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with everything Deputy Gilmore said. The position in regard to what the Minister proposes to do is even worse than has been outlined by Deputy Gilmore because there is another provision in this Bill which provides that unless a person who wishes to make a comment, an observation or an objection does so at the planning application stage and pays the fee, that person will not have the right, in the event of the planning authority making a decision that he or she does not like, to appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Pleanála. There is a double interference in the democratic right of the citizen to make a comment on developments which will affect him or her in any way as a result of the activities of other people.</P>
      <P>The Minister said people are getting something in return for this proposed charge. They will be slapped with a limitation in regard to their right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála if the Minister has his way, which I hope he does not. However, the Minister claims they are getting something valuable in return for this charge in that the Bill provides that comments, observations or objections made by individual citizens or any of the groups mentioned by Deputy Gilmore will, under the provisions of this Bill, have to be taken into consideration by the planning authority whereas he told us today the planning authority does not necessarily have to have any regard to them. That provision or that step forward is welcome but it is not one which requires a provision for a charge to accompany it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning system is there to regulate planning and development and, although the Minister will not have it in the Title of the Bill, to promote the idea of sustainable development in so far as it impinges on physical planning, which it does to a very marked degree. It is there to provide a public good, a service to the community, to respond to the development needs of the com<Col N="389" /> munity and to ensure they are met, as far as we can do that, in a sustainable way. It is part of the public service, the basic infrastructure of the State and of society, which we are entitled to have provided for us and for which we pay through our general tax system.</P>
    <P>Proposing, as the Minister does, that there be a charge for defending our individual rights in relation to planning matters is tantamount to proposing that there should be a charge any time we call on a member of the Garda Síochána for assistance or on any other public agency to carry out its statutory duty on our behalf. I do not believe that is right. There are a number of services to which the public is entitled as of right. One is law and order and the protection of that. Another is the protection of the environment, especially in the operation of the planning laws.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as a free lunch or a cost free service. The State, local authorities and planning authorities incur costs in carrying out their activities. There are some costs which it is fair to reflect directly on the community but there are others which it is not. I commend the Minister on providing that observations or objections made by individuals to planning applications should be statutorily taken notice of by local authorities but I reject the idea that there should be a charge for making such observations or objections. I also reject the notion that those who do not make an objection or a comment at the planning application stage lose their right to appeal against the decision of a planning authority, for all the reasons we spoke of on Committee Stage and I know the Minister understands them as well as anyone on this side of the House or the multitude of objectors to this provision.</P>
    <P>A planning application that may appear to be unobjectionable at the time it is made can result in a planning decision being made by the planning authority that has conditions attached to it that make it objectionable in some way to those who are affected or who have an interest in whatever way we define that. It is wrong, unjust and out of keeping with the intention of our planning law that someone who finds the original application unobjectionable but subsequently finds the planning decision objectionable should lose his right to appeal simply because he did not make an observation on or object to the original application. That is unfair. It is doubly unfair that the person should have to pay a fee. It is not required to make the Bill work, fund the planning system or make it fairer.</P>
    <P>This provision will make the planning system less accessible and amenable to the public and is to be rejected. I ask the Minister to delete this provision. There is no good reason for it. None of the reasons advanced by him in favour of it has reality in terms of any philosophy of public participation in planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputies Gilmore and Dukes in commending this amendment to the Minister. The arguments that have been so <Col N="390" /> cogently laid down by both of them merit little repetition but I will refer to just a few.</P>
      <P>It is critically important that we recognise that the imposition of a prescribed fee is patently unjust and, even more importantly, unnecessary. I have taken the views of both county and town planners and not only within my own constituency. While everyone does not sing from the one hymn sheet unquestionably the overwhelming number of those with whom I have spoken regard the imposition of a prescribed fee as a further administrative burden on planning staff who are already over stretched in coping with all the elements of the process to which they must attend. This fee will not aid a better planning service or ensure earlier decision-making but will add to the nightmare that is the day to day reality for planners and their staffs in authorities throughout this jurisdiction. The fee of £20 will not pay for itself in terms of the negative impact it will have in the operation of planning sections.</P>
      <P>As regards paragraph (<i>c</i>), enabling persons to make submissions or observations on payment of the prescribed fee, unquestionably people have made submissions and observations that have assisted and informed the planning decision-making process over many years. Planners fully acknowledge the input of the wider public, people with a special knowledge of the given circumstances, those with local knowledge and pertinent information, that has informed and guided planners in making correct decisions on various applications through the years. Now we are looking at imposing a penalty in terms of a monetary fee to be exacted from them for doing what is a public service, which is often the case. That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The presence of this element in the Bill also indicates that it is the intention of the Minister, if this is followed through, that the opportunity to offer submissions, observations or objections is to become the preserve of those who are not struggling to meet domestic and family needs. That may be scoffed at and dismissed by asking what can £20 seriously do to the weekly budget of Irish families today? That may be the view of the Minister for Finance but as a Deputy representing a Border constituency it might very well be an important element in any of the given situations to which I am privy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, on the collective argument that has been presented, to withdraw this element from the Bill. It is damaging and at variance with the purpose and intent of making the process an open and accessible opportunity for all members of society and all groups. There is no guarantee we are talking in terms of £20. There is no ceiling on that. Where is the guarantee that it will not be increased in the future? There is not any. People will be dissuaded because of the requirement of this fee and the further downside of that is, perhaps following on a decision by a local authority they will find themselves further inconvenienced or discommoded as a result of conditions that may apply and, as Deputy Dukes <Col N="391" /> said, will be excluded from participating at further stages of the planning hearing appeal stage and An Bord Pleanála stage. That is another deficiency that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the deletion of the reference to the payment of the prescribed fee and I hope he will afford us a positive reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to this section. This is a serious situation and I agree with the comments made by previous speakers. This Bill will be on the Statute Book for a long time and the Minister will accept it has taken at least two years to bring it before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Public participation is vital to the planning process. However, the Minister is introducing a provision which will restrict people's democratic rights. This is not just a question of the fee but that people will be precluded from objecting to An Bord Pleanála if they do not make observations when the application is made to the council. That is a serious situation.</P>
      <P>I have much experience of planning over many years and it is important to ensure the public has its say. I do not understand why the Minister is providing that people cannot appeal to An Bord Pleanála if they do not make observations in the first instance. This is a serious proposal which does not make sense.</P>
      <P>The £20 fee is also a serious issue. A substantial fee is already involved if people go to An Bord Pleanála and it is becoming very expensive for people who have a democratic right to object to a planning permission if they feel it interferes with their family or building. I object to these two provisions and I hope the Minister will withdraw this section in respect to the £20 fee and, particularly, the making of observations.</P>
      <P>The Minister will accept that councils grant many planning permissions but, in many cases, people may not see notices placed in newspapers or on sites. Some newspaper notices appear in Irish which people may not understand and it is only when planning permission is granted that the application is brought to the attention of those concerned. If people do not make observations at the planning stage the Minister is excluding them from appealing to An Bord Pleanála. This is a serious proposal which must be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support these amendments. The Minister and the Government are taking a regressive approach. This Bill was published on the basis it was making planning <Col N="392" /> more accessible but charging a fee for the right to make submissions is going in the opposite direction. This proposal will be a serious barrier to ordinary people, residents' associations and groups making an input into the planning process. The fee of £20 has been mentioned, and it is a significant enough sum, but there is nothing to prevent that figure being increased. The tendency has been for local authorities to go higher than £20 for all kinds of charges and fees.</P>
      <P>This proposal raises a question of natural justice. By its nature, a planning application impinges and imposes on the community in which the development is to be sited and can affect the community in many ways, including its quality of life and its physical make-up. Groups who wish to make submissions and observations on how a planning application will affect them, and who are acting in the best interests of communities, did not ask for the application to be made. The application is being imposed on them by a third party whose interests can sometimes be in conflict with those of the community. In such circumstances it is totally unjust to require residents' associations or individuals affected by an application to pay a fee to ensure proper planning for their areas and for responding to something over which they had no control.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that it can be quite costly for residents' associations or individuals to make submissions and observations. Depending on the proposed development, an application may be complex and individuals and residents' groups often have to hire planners and engineers to make a comprehensive and professional observation and analysis of a project. This can be costly in terms of money, time and effort. In many cases people are already stretching themselves as regards observations and submissions.</P>
      <P>In the case of a significant development, perhaps of a commercial nature, those who propose the development generally have no restrictions on the amount of money they can spend. The Flood tribunal has shown how people in pursuit of large scale developments have thrown money like confetti at politicians and others to secure favourable decisions. However, individual residents and residents' associations have no such funds available to protect their communities and their environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tendency for certain elements in society favourable to developers and such like to try to railroad proposals through the planning process and to ride roughshod over the rights of community organisations, residents' associations and individuals who make submissions and, particularly, objections. For the most part this tendency is unspoken but it will grow. On at least one recent occasion, even the Taoiseach made derogatory remarks about people who have objections to significant infrastructural developments such as the port tunnel. Communities see this proposal as affecting their quality of life and their environment. Whether one agrees or disagrees with their arguments is not important, <Col N="393" /> but one must agree they have an absolute right to make those arguments.</P>
    <P>The Government claims the national development plan will involve infrastructural developments costing £40 billion over five to seven years. Community associations and residents' and environmental groups perform a crucial function but there is a tendency to see them as an inconvenience to developers who wish to roll in the concrete at any cost.</P>
    <P>On a broader scale, such thinking has reduced the magnificent resource of the Amazon to dire and dangerous proportions due to the destruction caused to it. The whistle is being blown too late in this regard and, as a public representative, I am not prepared to stand by and see any such tendency being allowed to take over and dictate policy. However, I am afraid this provision, and some of those in later sections which restrict the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála and to seek a judicial review, are going in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long debate on this issue on Second and Committee Stages in this House and in the Seanad. The arguments expressed this afternoon have been made on a number of occasions. I am sure the Deputies opposite will forgive me if I refer to the replies I gave them previously. This section is probably the one that has been debated most on earlier Stages. If this aspect of the Bill were taken in isolation, I could accept that the observations and accusations levelled at the Government by the Deputies are justified, but this aspect cannot be taken in isolation.</P>
      <P>The intent of the overall effort put into the Bill is to make the planning system more accessible and open and to encourage people, as far as possible, to participate fully in the planning process at the appropriate time. I have said on a number of occasions in the past that people tend to wait until planning permission has been granted, or until there is word of it being granted, for a development before they bother to check what is happening in their locality. Many people become aware of a planning application in their locality when they see the required notice displayed on the site and then they become exercised about it, which is only right, as it may affect them. Very few people bother to check draft development plans at which stage zonings and various decisions of a general nature are taken on planning, which will affect people in their local areas. It is at that stage people should commence participation in the planning process and not, as many do, allow local authorities to draw up development plans that provide for the zoning of an area for residential purposes and seek to change that provision only when the notice for the planning application is displayed on the site.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed in a balanced way to direct people to use the planning and development laws more productively, to realise their rights and to exercise them at an earlier stage. That would prevent some of the confrontation in the planning process. The Bill gets the balance right in that regard</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> With regard to the specific amendments before us and the provision in the Bill to impose a fee on people who want to make representations, observations or objections to a planning application, if I were proposing to slap a prescribed fee on such people, I probably could agree with some of the points made by the Deputies, but I am not doing that. I am not merely proposing to impose a fee on such people to increase the revenue accruing to local authorities, although some financial contribution should be made towards the cost of the services they provide. For the first time ever, I am providing in law for statutory recognition to be given to submissions or observations on specific planning applications made by members of the public to local authorities. We can talk all evening about whether people have that right, whether they should be charged for it or whether it is a right, given that most of the planning systems throughout Europe do not allow, as a right, third party observations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have led the way on this and, as Deputy Dukes said, there is no harm in us continuing to lead the way. We will do that, but we will go one step further by giving statutory recognition to such observations and objections submitted by members of the public to local authorities. At present local authorities do not need to take account of observations or objections submitted by members of the public but, to their credit, most of them do. I accept the argument put forward that in many cases such observations have been helpful to local authorities when they come to make decisions or in pointing out matters of which members of local authorities were not aware. I accept those are beneficial aspects of third party submissions to local authorities and I would not want to discourage them.</P>
      <P>We are conferring an important new right in this Bill, a person's statutory right to have his or her objection or submission considered by the local authority. For exercising that right, we want to charge a small fee, which I indicated will not exceed £20. It is not my intention that the level of such a fee will be such as to discourage people from making such observations, rather it is a question of the fee being paid and statutory recognition being given to that right. We will deal with the other part of the equation when we come to deal with the next group of amendments. One then has a right to make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, if one so desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes's amendment proposes that a fee should be paid only in certain circumstances, where the person making the submission or observation has a commercial or economic interest in an application or whose commercial or economic interest may be affected by it. We could not discriminate in that manner. For example, such a provision could mean a next door neighbour would have to pay a fee for making a sub<Col N="395" /> mission regarding a development that he or she considers would affect the value of his or her property, while a person living down the other end of the country, who would not be affected in any way by such a development, would not have to pay the fee. Such a provision would be found to be discriminatory and, therefore, I could not accept that amendment.</P>
    <P>This section confers a statutory right that a person's objection or observations will be recognised by a local authority. Given that the fee is very small, I do not think it will dissuade anybody who so wishes from making observations or objections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Minister's argument. This fee is being introduced to discourage people from participating in the planning process. The fee will raise a relatively small amount of money for planning authorities. As Deputy Ó Caoláin said, it will be an administrative headache for planning departments. It is included in the Bill because the <Col N="396" /> Government wants to discourage citizens from participating in the planning process by writing individual letters to county councils when they want to object to a planning application. It is unfair in that it will discriminate most against those who cannot afford to pay the fee.</P>
      <P>I know elderly people who will not go to the doctor because they do not have the £20 fee. They are precisely the people who will be discouraged. They may have strong and legitimate objections to a planning application in their locality but if they cannot afford to pay a fee of £20 they will not lodge the objection. That is undemocratic, unfair and unjust and I want to put the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore to move amendment No. 135. Amendment No. 136 is an alternative to amendment No. 135 and both may be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 135:</P>
      <P>In page 60, to delete lines 23 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) An applicant for permission and any other person may, at any time before the   expiration of the appropriate period, appeal to the Board against a decision of a   planning authority under <i>section 34</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. The Government has just won a vote on the proposal to require people to pay a fee to make an observation or objection to a planning authority on a planning application. We are now dealing with section 37, where the Minister is proposing to restrict the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála to the applicant or anybody who made an objection or observation to the local authority, in other words, anybody who paid the fee and made an objection or appeal to An Bord Pleanála. That is the second fundamental change the Minister is proposing to make to the current planning system, restricting the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>There is a variety of reasons somebody who did not initially make an objection to the planning authority should have the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. This is a further restriction that the Minister is imposing on the rights of the public. Up to now, any third party could lodge an appeal with An Bord Pleanála against a decision of a planning authority, which the board could then deal with. That was a fundamental public service right.</P>
      <P>There is provision in existing planning legislation and this Bill for An Bord Pleanála to immediately dismiss vexatious or frivolous appeals. Therefore, there is no argument that this is being included to weed out vexatious or frivolous objections or appeals because they are already capable of being weeded out by the provisions in the Bill. An Bord Pleanála can simply dismiss a vexatious or frivolous appeal. We are talking here about genuine appeals. The Minister and the Government are proposing in this legislation to restrict the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála against a planning decision to those people who paid the fee in the first place and made an initial observation to the local authority.</P>
      <P>When we discussed the previous section, I spoke about elderly people who may have to go to the doctor the week a planning objection has to be made to the local authority. They may have to choose between paying the doctor's £20 fee or writing to the local authority. If they decide to visit the doctor, under this section, they will be prevented from appealing to An Bord Pleanála if the planning authority gives a decision they are not in favour of, no matter how strongly they feel about the decision.</P>
      <P>This is a further denial and restriction of public democratic rights which is being insisted on by the Government. There are many good things in this Bill but the Government and the Minister are also making a number of very serious and damaging changes in it. The Bill is riddled with restrictions on the public's right to have its say in the planning process. This is one of the provisions restricting the right to go to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> My amendment proposes to remove that restriction from the Bill and it would allow, as is the case at present, any third party to make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment. We had a long discussion on this issue on Committee Stage. The Minister should accept these amendments in the interest of democratic rights for our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 136, which is in my name and that of Deputy Gilmore, is an alternative to amendment No. 135, in the names of Deputies Gilmore and Ó Caoláin. I am indifferent between the two, as long as one is accepted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore rightly said that the purpose of the amendments is to remove from the Bill one of the fundamental changes it proposes to the planning law. Until now, as the Minister has repeated on a number of occasions during the debate on the Bill, we have had the most accessible appeals system in Europe. We have the widest right of any member state of the European Union for the citizen to appeal against planning decisions. That is good, is one of the few areas where our planning law has something to recommend it over the laws of other countries and is worth keeping.</P>
      <P>I suspect the restriction on the right of appeal to those who are either appellants themselves or have made observations or objections at the planning application stage is included in the Bill to meet the claim made by a number of interests to the effect that third party appeals are gumming up the works of our planning system. I reject that notion because that is not what is causing delays in our planning system.</P>
      <P>I have heard colleagues on both sides of the House becoming rather ill humoured at various times about the fact that appeals against planning permissions in their area are being made by people &ldquo;at the other end of the country&rdquo;, which is how it is always phrased. However, those appeals are being made by people who are expressing a legitimate, public interest. It is usually not a commercial or economic interest but is an interest in the proper planning and sustainable development of our environment. They are expressing a legitimate interest and view in the context of our planning process. There is no justification for limiting the expression of that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Gilmore said, there is already provision in law to reject frivolous appeals. Appeals which turn out not to be frivolous should, by definition, be considered. There is no good reason to introduce a provision in law that restricts the expression of those legitimate interests, which is what this provision in the Bill does, apart from the consideration, to which we referred before, that conditions may be put on a planning permission which originally seem innocuous to the persons concerned but which becomes a matter of more pressing interest and, perhaps, something objectionable once those conditions are made. This is not far-fetched as this is <Col N="400" /> not an unusual or unknown situation. However, this provision will prevent somebody who had no objection to the first planning application, but who has found a condition on a grant of planning permission objectionable, from appealing to An Bord Pleanála. That is unjust.</P>
    <P>There is no good reason in planning law for doing that. There is only this myth that, in some way, the right of third parties to object is gumming up our planning system. That is the only ground on which I have heard any justification being made for this provision in the Bill. It is a spurious ground. There are far more delays in our planning system because of the inadequate staffing and resourcing of planning authorities than there are because of the multiplicity of third party appeals. That is an observable fact. There is no good reason for having this provision in the Bill. The Minister would be doing us all a favour and something worthwhile in the interests of sustainable development if he accepted either of these amendments and got rid of this pernicious provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I strongly support these amendments. A very important issue is at stake here. The provisions in the Bill to restrict access to An Bord Pleanála militate against what is stated in the explanatory memorandum, that the legislation will facilitate maximum participation in the planning process. This measure is going in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>There are many instances where people would not be aware of a planning application and might only hear about it at a later stage. If the permission is granted and people only then find out that they will be severely affected by it, it is unjust that they will be denied the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. I have been a county councillor for nine years and have encountered many genuine cases where individual residents or even residents' groups have only become aware of a matter after a decision has been made by the planning authority. In many areas that will not be the case. Some residents' organisations are extremely well organised and resourced. They tend to have more access to information. That is not always the case in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the example of the greater Blanchardstown area. It is exploding in terms of development. Residents are moving into new communities by the day and the week. Hundreds of homes are occupied over a period of a few months. At the same time there is a plethora of applications for further development by developers and builders. In an expanding new area such as west Dublin, a decision might already have been made in relation to an adjoining area of land before the new residents have moved in and become aware of it. It is unjust in those circumstances that they do not have the fallback of recourse to An Bord Pleanála. In that instance, even if people are extremely vigilant, they are still new residents in an area &ndash; in fact, they are a new community &ndash; and they are seriously disadvantaged where a <Col N="401" /> decision has already been made before they become aware of it. The Minister is severely restricting their right to participate in the planning process.</P>
    <P>The remarks of the preceding Deputies are correct. The objective is clearly to cut out and discourage appeals from as many people as possible and, in some cases, appeals from environmental organisations and others who have a more general brief in society. That is wrong. These groups bring a special expertise and viewpoint to the planning process which can be overlooked by other agencies closer to the coalface, as it were. They have a right and an obligation to bring forward the wider arguments. There can be situations where there are so many pressures locally, that even though they are not happy with a project people feel pressurised not to object because the project is being railroaded through. In those instances, people who are more removed from physical closeness to the situation have a unique input and one that should not be lost.</P>
    <P>If it is being suggested that there is a problem dealing with objections, the solution is not to cut down on democratic rights but to increase the resources of An Bord Pleanála to ensure that all objections and observations, from whatever side, can be dealt with in a shorter period. The route the Minister should take is to put more resources, facilities and money into An Bord Pleanála and the planning process by hiring more staff and expertise so appeals can be dealt with in a shorter time frame. That will give the best possible outcome by ensuring the input of all groups and no undue delays due to lack of staff.</P>
    <P>It will be a bad day's work if the Government continues on this course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 136. The charge and this provision are linked. I listened carefully to the Minister's comments in respect of the charge. He used the word &ldquo;isolation&rdquo; for taking it out of context and said the process would be more accessible if his provision was retained. The same will apply to this provision. I cannot understand why the two provisions have been included.</P>
      <P>The third party right will be diminished by placing a charge on submissions objecting to a planning application if only a person who has objected can make an appeal on a decision. This does not allow for that fact that there might be no objections to the development just to the conditions of the development. These cannot be presumed in advance of a decision. That is the position. Who can presume what the conditions will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the issue of conditions. Take the example of a man who makes an application to build a house. There are families living on both sides of the site. One family is happy with the application but the other is not happy and requests a certain condition to be attached to the planning decision. That request might be granted. The other family, however, is denied the right to <Col N="402" /> appeal against the condition. This point has been made previously but I am not sure that the Minister has taken it into consideration. Dozens of similar examples can be given.</P>
    <P>The Minister is denying people their democratic right to object by including this condition. This is a serious matter. People have constitutional rights and I can envisage some cases ending up in the courts. The Minister is also making the planning process more awkward for administrators in terms of the administration of planning law. I accept that there are good elements in the Bill but I cannot understand why these two conditions have been included.</P>
    <P>The democratic right of people to object to a planning application should be retained. Putting restrictions on that right effectively denies them the right. I feel strongly about this issue. It is a fundamental change in planning law. Such a provision did not exist previously. I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to give consideration to what we are saying about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that this is a fundamental change to our planning laws which is wrong and should be corrected. If the Minister does not correct this provision, it will create planning problems in every county, some of which I fear will end up in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments before us would have the effect of removing the restrictions on persons taking third party appeals who have not participated in the initial decision making process at local authority level. I assure Deputies that an amendment was tabled on Committee Stage to cater for cases such as those referred to by Deputies D'Arcy and Dukes. An amendment was tabled which will permit persons whose interest in the land is affected by a decision of the authority to apply to the board for leave to appeal against the decision. If the board finds the decision is materially different from the application by reason of conditions that might be imposed on it &ndash; the case referred to by Deputy D'Arcy is a case in point &ndash; and that the person's interest in the property is materially affected, it can grant leave to appeal. That is a reasonable compromise given the situation which pertained initially and meets the concerns of the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other changes were discussed recently where a fee will be imposed. However, in return, the provision whereby one will have a statutory right to make submissions and have them carefully considered is set out for the first time in the planning laws. I remind Members that planning authorities are the final decision making bodies for over 90% of applications. It is critical if people believe they have something to contribute to the planning process that they do so at that level and at that stage. Most decisions are not appealed and it is only fair that the local planning authority, <Col N="403" /> which is responsible for planning and development in its area, has the opportunity to consider any local objections or observations because of its local knowledge. The aim is to try to focus people on the local authority as the primary planning authority with responsibility for planning decisions. It is for this reason I have provided that third parties must make a submission on a planning application in order to exercise a right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála. There are no other restrictions placed on them and I believe that when the Bill is passed we will have the most open planning system in Europe. This provision will not affect that aspect.</P>
    <P>It would be wonderful in the Utopian world in which some people here seem to live if we could assume that everyone who makes an appeal to <Col N="404" /> An Bord Pleanála is motivated by the highest environmental and other considerations and if we could turn a blind eye to the fact that a number of people in different parts of the country are using the planning system to extort money from people who are trying to provide facilities, whether housing, commercial developments or otherwise. I am aware of many instances where the planning system is being used to extort money from people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 162:</P>
      <P>In page 78, lines 39 and 40, to delete &ldquo;and that the applicant has a substantial interest in the matter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin who is unable to be present asked me to mention that there is a printing error in amendment No. 160, the last two lines of which should not have appeared.</P>
      <P>The issue we are about to address relates to the right to seek a judicial review of a planning decision in the High Court. The Government has put in a very bad afternoon's work on behalf of the people. It has forced through a proposal under which an individual citizen, residents' association or community group will have to make a payment, probably £20, to a planning authority to object to a planning application. An individual citizen will no longer have the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála a planning decision with which he or she is unhappy unless he or she first objects to the local authority and pays the appropriate fee of £20. If that was not bad enough the Government is now proposing to restrict the circumstances in which a judicial review may be sought in the High Court.</P>
      <P>To obtain leave to seek a judicial review of a planning decision the High Court will have to be satisfied on two points. It will have to be satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid or ought to be quashed. I agree with this. The High Court should be satisfied that there are good and sufficient grounds for seeking a review. The courts should not be used willy-nilly for frivolous purposes to delay projects. The High Court will also have to be satisfied that the applicant has a substantial interest in the matter which is the subject of the application. I object to this. What does it mean? Does it mean that he or she should have a financial or property interest before he or she can seek a judicial review?</P>
      <P>I propose that this reference be deleted. Deputy Dukes has an alternative amendment which suggests that the word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; should be substituted for the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;. I would be happy with that formulation as it would make it clear that an applicant would not have to have a material interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendments reads, &ldquo;A substantial interest for the purposes of <i>paragraph (b) </i>is not limited to an interest in land or other financial interest.&rdquo;  This can be read in one of two ways. It either reinforces what I suspect was meant by &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; in the first instance, a material interest in the land or development, or alternatively it will leave the matter open-ended. If that is the case the relevant words should be deleted. To obtain leave to seek a judicial review in the High Court it should be sufficient to show that there are good grounds for seeking it. The seeking of a review should not be based on the status of the applicant but on the grounds on which it is being made. I have difficulty with, and strongly object to the provision that in addition to the grounds of the application, the status of the applicant relative to the development will also have to be adjudicated on by the court before a judicial review can be obtained. It limits the fundamental right of the citizen under the Constitution and by law to go to court if there are good grounds for so doing. The Bill proposes to limit that right to circumstances which are related to the status of the applicant, relative to the development which is to be the subject of the judicial review. I do not believe that should be the case. The provision should be removed and if the Minister is not satisfied to do that he should accept the alternative amendment in the name of Deputy Dukes. Given that his own amendment is ambiguous and is capable of being interpreted either way &ndash; ultimately the courts will interpret it &ndash; it should not be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 163 and 164 in my name are complementary. The Ceann Comhairle suggested they were alternatives. They are not; they are alternatives to the amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore and they could reasonably be seen as alternatives to amendment No. 166 in the name of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore when he says that judicial review should effectively be the exception rather than the rule in cases like this. That is made clear in current practice and in the Bill. Section 49(1) states: &ldquo;Where a question of law arises on any appeal or referral, the Board may refer the question to the High Court for decision.&rdquo;. That gives us the context. Judicial review can be sought where it is claimed that there has been some legal defect in the process by which a decision has been given or a referral has been made. It is important to remember that, because the judicial review has nothing to do with the intrinsic planning concerns of a decision or a referral but with the process. The courts do not have any knowledge of the process of proper planning and development, <i>qua</i> planning and development, but they do have knowledge of the procedure by which these things have to regulated. It is in that context that judicial review should be seen. It is right that we should be restrictive in our approach to this because it is the job of the courts to decide on the law while it is the job of the planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to decide on questions of planning and proper planning and development.</P>
      <P>The question then arises, in what circumstances can an applicant seek to have a judicial review? We have stubbed our toe in the provision of section 49(4)(<i>b</i>), which provides that the applicant must have a &ldquo;substantial interest in the matter which is the subject of the application.&rdquo;. We discussed this at length on Committee Stage and without being disobliging to anybody, least of all the Minister, I came away from that discussion without any clear idea in my mind of what would be regarded as a substantial interest. I do not know whether a substantial interest is a property, financial, planning, social or theoretical interest or whatever. I am not happy with the idea of writing things into legislation which we cannot comprehend at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that a similar provision already appears in legislation. It does not alter my opinion, because I still wish to know what it consists of. That is why I propose the deletion of the reference to a &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; and the provision instead that the applicant should have a &ldquo;sufficient interest&rdquo; and that this interest would include an interest not relating solely to property. I am seeking to ensure that a person who has an interest in these matters, which is not the value of his property or the kind of economic activity in which he or she is engaged that may be affected by the proposed development, but whose interest is in the proper planning and development of the area, including the sustainable development, would have the right to seek access <Col N="408" /> to the courts for a decision on the procedures adopted in the case.</P>
    <P>I realise that the question put to the court cannot have anything to do with the planning aspects of the issue, but must be concerned with the procedure by which a decision was arrived at or a referral was made. That is why we must distinguish between these two things. I do not make the case that the interest itself or the nature of the interest should be at issue before the court because that is outside the terms of reference of the court. The only issue that can come before the court is the question as to whether the procedures that are laid down in law were properly observed in arriving at whatever point is at issue.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned about here is to ensure that persons who have a legitimate <i>locus standi</i> in the issue are not excluded from having such a question adjudicated upon and are not excluded from being the ones who initiate the request for such an adjudication to be made. That is why I have proposed that the applicant should have a sufficient interest and that the interest should not relate solely to property.</P>
    <P>It is left to the court to decide whether the applicant has a sufficient interest, just as, if the Minister's amendment was to be enacted, it would be left to the court to decide whether the applicant had a substantial interest. I do not know what the courts would make of that. With every respect to them, I believe that when legislating we should give the courts as much guidance as we can and be as clear as we can about what we mean.</P>
    <P>I do not know what a court would make of the idea of a substantial interest, but when we talk about substantial interest and are dealing with real property, which is what we deal with in planning law, the likelihood is that a court would say that a substantial interest in real property amounts to a property, commercial or economic interest. I would not be confident that, with regard to a specific development, a court would necessarily find that, for example, An Taisce had a substantial interest in the meaning of what appears to be the intention in the Bill. However, if an organisation like An Taisce was involved, a court would find that it had a sufficient interest in a planning matter. If we provided that a sufficient interest would include an interest not related solely to money, there would be no doubt but that, for example, An Taisce would have the kind of interest that would give it a <i>locus standi</i> in the case. I believe the court would look the same way at a person who had an interest in planning issues generally and who was making a case with regard to an application for permission for a specific kind of development.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 166 in the name of the Minister makes an effort to come in the direction of the case I have made. The Minister is proposing that a substantial interest is not limited to an interest in land or other financial interest, and it is certainly a much more open formulation than that which is contained in the Bill. It is a substan<Col N="409" /> tial step along the road, but it is still not clear to me the kind of interests the Minister has in mind as being legitimate in this connection. I ask the Minister, who I assume will move amendment No. 166 when we get to it, to explain where might lie the boundaries of a substantial interest not limited to an interest in land or other financial interest in order that we can begin to discern whether we are talking in the same ballpark, if I may be allowed to mix metaphors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I strongly support the amendments in the name of Deputy Gilmore which go furthest in trying to redress the appalling precedent which the Minister is setting here. If one of the claims made for the Bill is that it introduces more definite regulations, laws and clarity regarding planning, then this provision, that an application may not be made for judicial review unless the applicant has a substantial interest, goes in the opposite direction. As Deputy Dukes pointed out, that to which substantial interest refers is anything but certain. It is not in anybody's interest that it is left in this vague fashion. I would have a great fear that in the High Court substantial interest could be narrowly defined by members of the Judiciary, some of whom can be quite conservative in their outlook, and that it would be defined in terms of people who might have a material interest in the application or the decision made. That would be going backward in the extreme when the forward direction of planning sought by people who seek sustainable and proper planning is precisely that planning would be released from the constraints of material interest and those with profits or large amounts of money at stake. It is critical that the interests, which can be involved and taken into account, are over and above material or property interests.</P>
      <P>There is nothing definite on the question of the environment, the question of air quality, for example, and concern over possible pollution. There is, for example, a major push on the part of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to adopt incineration in Ireland as a policy for waste management. That is a disastrous policy but that is another day's discussion. Every right thinking public representative would say that of course the communities within 30 or 40 kilometres of a proposed incinerator have a substantial interest in the decision because it can relate to the quality of the air they breath. The same is the case regarding other environmental concerns which could be raised. Will this allow them to take a judicial review should they find one necessary to protect their rights as they see them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be developments which have a severe impact, for example, on flora and fauna. Perhaps the very continuance of a particular species of plant or creature could be involved. Of course environmental groups or groups concerned about the preservation of what millions of years of evolution has bequeathed to us have a substantial <Col N="410" /> interest, even if some of them are based, as was alluded to earlier, at the other end of the country. Why should we be so concerned about what happens in the Amazon basin? We have a substantial interest in what happens there despite the fact that we are thousands of miles removed from it. Therefore, the Minister's proposal is dreadfully regressive.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some curious comments on the last tranche of amendments when he was cut short by the constraints of time. He referred to people extorting money or seeking to manipulate the planning process. The Minister used the words &ldquo;to extort money&rdquo;. Extortion in my view conjures up serious illegality. If there is serious illegality, nobody more than the Minister should be dealing with that in a legal way. In other words, it should be amenable to the law of the land. Perhaps I am one of the people who he accuses of living in Utopia, but I do not know to what the Minister was referring. If there is extortion, that must be dealt with by other means but should not be used as an excuse to curtail the democratic right of people to access the courts. The Minister should elaborate on that. I do not wish to delay the House, but the Deputies who tabled the amendments raised these crucial points in the long process of Committee Stage and this is my only opportunity to do so. There are certain instances where it may be in order for agencies to provide compensation where they propose developments which would have a dramatic impact on neighbouring residences.</P>
    <P>My last point&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. McGrath)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is related to the amendment which we are discussing, that is amendment No. 162. The Deputy is wandering a little from it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> With respect, Acting Chairman, I do not think I am. The amendment has to do with access to, and who would qualify for, a judicial review. We are debating six amendments together here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes's amendment regarding &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; interest is an improvement on the wording of the Minister, but there is a lack of certainty about &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; also. The interpretation of the word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; would be left up to the courts. I would prefer a more open wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another use of the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; in the same paragraph on which there has not been much comment. Section 49(3)(<i>b</i>) states that leave for judicial review &ldquo;. shall not be granted unless the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid .&rdquo;  That has been overshadowed a little by the debate on &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo;, but it is something at which the Deputies should look. We debated that issue on the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, but this is a new departure. It means that if an applicant is to show substantial grounds in order to be granted a judicial review, at the stage of <Col N="411" /> application for judicial review the applicant must make his or her substantial case. It will mean that instead of the five minutes which is often taken in the High Court for presenting a general application for granting the right to a judicial review, the applicant's barrister must take up a substantial amount of time showing that he or she has substantial grounds for getting it. That is something on which I invite comment here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a certain lack of certainty similar to a sufficient lack of sufficiency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the final point made by Deputy Higgins about substantial grounds, that phrase has been a part of planning and development since it was introduced in 1992. &ldquo;Substantial grounds&rdquo; has been defined by the High Court as &ldquo;weighty&rdquo; and &ldquo;arguable&rdquo;. It has also used words such as &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;not trivial or tenuous&rdquo;. Deputies asked during their contributions for definitions. I will not attempt to perform a judicial role in the House because the courts have been more than able to make up their minds about what is meant by and implied in legislation. It is clear what we are talking about here.</P>
      <P>As a general comment on some of the examples cited by Members, in a planning case, which is what we are dealing with here &ndash; and it is important we focus on the fact that it is with such a case we are dealing &ndash; a substantial interest would relate to a planning interest. In other words, it is something connected with planning. If a person is directly affected by a decision, he or she would obviously have a substantial interest and doubtless that would be recognised by the courts. However, if a person were to argue a theoretical point, he could hardly be described as having a substantial interest in something, and the courts would probably make their own decision about that. I have no doubt that some of the organisations mentioned would have a substantial interest or substantial grounds in many cases for seeking appeals for judicial review.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the argument during the course of the debate on Committee Stage was that the phraseology in the Bill would be interpreted by the courts as meaning that a person would have to have a monetary or property interest in the proceedings they were taking. That case was strongly argued by a number of people, including Deputy Dukes who tabled an amendment. I indicated that I would re-examine this to clarify it further for the courts. That is why I tabled my amendment. Most of the argument centred around the danger of the court interpreting &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; as a property or financial interest. Following discussions with the parliamentary draftsman, we brought forward an amendment to clarify this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore said two interpretations can be taken from the amendment. I cannot see a second interpretation and I do not accept his <Col N="412" /> point. It is clear that, for the purposes of paragraph (<i>b</i>), &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; is not limited to an interest in land or other financial interest, which is the point made on Committee Stage and with which I have dealt in this amendment. The amendment also meets the point Deputy Dukes made in his amendment. The two are similar. I do not propose to delete the reference to having a substantial interest as proposed in the other amendment tabled by the Deputies. I set out my reasons in great detail on Committee Stage for not accepting that. I understand that Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment No. 160 has not been moved so I will not address that.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the point about the Judiciary being conservative when it comes to judicial reviews. The courts exist to interpret the law and, in some cases, the Constitution. The Judiciary has been very open to accepting judicial reviews of and challenges to various decisions, especially in the planning area. It has vindicated the rights of citizens on a regular basis. It would be unfair to say that it is conservative in its approach. Its members take seriously their roles as interpreters of the Constitution and defenders of the citizens, and it would be unfair not to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to another matter which was the last one to which I referred on the previous amendment. I did not manage to finish the comments I made about people using the planning system to extort money, but that is what I meant. It is illegal and it is possible to have a person prosecuted if one can get a person to make a formal complaint. As far as I know, a developer in the south has decided to pursue such a case. The problem faced by developers and most people caught in this bind is that, if they go to court or to the Garda, the person who objected or someone acting on his behalf will object to the next development and the developer cannot afford the delay. That is happening and there is no point burying our heads in the sand. The planning system was also used in a case cited not just by me but by one or two others where a person with a commercial interest funded objections to planning applications through the High Court on a number of occasions purely on the basis that a person was setting up in business in competition to the person funding the action. That type of abuse of the system is not good for anyone and brings the system into disrepute. The Deputy asked me to elaborate on that, I have done so and I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.</P>
    <P>The definition of a substantial interest is reasonable, arguable, weighty and not trivial or tenuous. We are debating this in the context of planning law, and a substantial interest would not merely be a property interest. Planning is about more than property. As Deputy Higgins said in the course of his contribution, it includes a range of considerations, such as environmental, community, social, etc. I am satisfied that no one's rights will be infringed and that the rights of the citizen are fully protected in the amendment I <Col N="413" /> tabled to this section in response to the issues raised with me on Committee Stage. I ask the Deputies to accept my amendment in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with the issue the Minister has twice raised, that is, the prospect of certain people either lodging appeals with An Bord Pleanála for the purposes of extorting money or of delaying a development or seeking a judicial review with the same intent. If there is evidence&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention that in the context of a judicial review but in the context of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is evidence of that having been done, that evidence should be supplied to the Flood tribunal because that is as much a corruption of the planning process as somebody extorting money for the purposes of promoting a development. If there is evidence, for example, of commercial interests financing the objection to a development because it is a competing interest or whatever, similarly, that is a valid topic to be examined by the Flood tribunal because the terms of reference this House gave to that tribunal referred to people seeking to improperly or corruptly influence the planning process. The planning process is as improperly or corruptly influenced if it is being done for the purposes of stopping development as if it is being done for the purposes of promoting development, and that is where issues of that kind should be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that also because running through the Minister's rationale for what he is attempting to do in this section, what he has succeeded in doing in relation to the appeals to An Bord Pleanála and in regard to making people pay to lodge objections, is accepted a line which has been promoted by some developers in recent years that the problem with the planning process is that people are objecting. The idea has developed that it is all the fault of the people objecting, that <Col N="414" /> people object to the local authority, appeal to An Bord Pleanála and then seek a judicial review, all of which are irritations and delay matters, that the people to blame for everything are objectors.</P>
    <P>That is an unwise course to take. It is unfair to people who have genuine concerns and reasons for objecting to a development, appealing it to An Bord Pleanála or seeking a judicial review to essentially make that more difficult through this legislation because it is perceived that some people do this almost as a profession. Incidentally, if there are people who do this almost as a profession, they should reflect now on the consequences of having done that. We are ending up in a situation where the rights of the ordinary citizen are being restricted in legislation because there is a perception that a degree of &ldquo;objectionitis&rdquo; has been operating in the planning system. In any event, it does not justify the Government introducing this kind of restriction on the rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>Our particular difference in relation to this amendment centres on the question of substantial interest and what is substantial interest. What is interest? Is it the kind of interest which would have to be declared to this House, for example, which is generally accepted to be a material interest? A Member of this House does not have to come in here and say that he or she is interested in fine art, if there is a debate&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to focus on the large number of people caught between owning their own home and being accepted as possible tenants for social housing. The vast majority of these people wish to own their own home and to invest their earnings in their future and that of their children, but are prevented from doing so by the prohibitive cost of housing.</P>
      <P>Housing is a major concern for many young people and their parents. These people are concerned about their future, where they are going to live and the fact they are committed to renting accommodation for the long-term. Such people earn decent salaries, probably own their own cars, take foreign holidays each year and can afford nights out. However, the majority of them are dependent on rented accommodation and pay high rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people in my constituency rent three bedroom houses for £500, £800 or £1,000 per month, depending on the area. This commitment prevents them from obtaining their own property as they cannot afford a deposit or a mortgage on a property costing between £100,000 and £120,000, depending on the area. Many people find themselves in the ludicrous situation of paying dead money for accommodation month after month. The Government is doing nothing to help such people and there is no emphasis on support<Col N="424" /> ing them or enabling them to own their own homes. The Government should transfer State resources to facilitate people.</P>
    <P>People are not asking for hand-outs or for the State to provide their housing. They are asking for support and assistance to get them started. The affordable housing scheme is not viable in my area of Cork and there is no support for such a scheme. The shared ownership scheme is a joke as house prices are often far in excess of the maximum loan allowed.</P>
    <P>Many young people are dependent on the private rented sector and will be for the foreseeable future. I often come across three or four young people sharing rented accommodation. That is their future and they see no way of getting themselves out of that situation. There is a need for legislation concerning the private rented sector to provide basic rights for tenants as called for by the motion, which I support.</P>
    <P>The private rented sector is growing and many people are dependent on it for housing. If renting is to involve so many people there is a need for legislation to ensure that landlords are registered. Less than 10% of them register their homes or apartments. There is also a need for security of tenure for residential tenants and to ensure that rents cannot double overnight at the whim of a landlord. Such increases can mean that those paying £300 per month are suddenly faced with rents of between £500 and £600 without any means of meeting such a payment. Given the increasing importance of the private rented sector I am pleading for legislation and reform to protect tenants and their rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing crisis continues because we as an elected body are not good enough. This crisis was created by national policy, or the lack of it. There has been a lack of leadership at Government level to see that money was invested in infrastructure. There has also been a failure to make decisions as to where that infrastructure should go. Local authorities have been left without guidance as to where and when water and sewerage, road or rail improvements would occur and civil servants have acted with caution and without ministerial challenge to their do nothing policy.</P>
      <P>In the past, locally elected members of councils, when they realised the problem, made an effort to ensure an adequate supply of housing land. In return councils were abused because they took ownership of the situation. Councils also received poor professional advice to the effect that land should not be zoned as it was not serviced. However, land will never be serviced if it is not zoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic planning guidelines have been in place for almost two years but the Government has not given a logical response outlining where and how it intends to face the challenge. The Bacon reports have done little to ease the problem and the removal of the benefits of section 23 <Col N="425" /> reliefs only served to push up the cost of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The reduction of the tax rate from 40% to 20% on the sale of building land was scandalous. An independent owner whose farm is zoned will sell that farm no matter what the tax rate because the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has been unable to protect basic farm incomes. If the Government has sufficient cash to sacrifice 50% of its tax take, it should have forfeited it to local authorities to give them the financial resources to enter the housing land market and to build houses at a price affordable to ordinary working people.</P>
    <P>We must take account of labour shortages in the construction industry. Most businesses are only capable of expanding productivity by 10% to 15% while maintaining quality control. The Fingal council area had 4,000 applicants out of the 10,000 houses built in Dublin last year, so the increase might be expected to be 600. However, such an increase is not good enough to meet the demand. The majority of these houses were built on land zoned for housing in the 1993 county development plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and condemn the Government's abject failure to deal with local authority housing lists. It is unfair that those untouched by the Celtic tiger who cannot buy their own homes must wait for years for a council house. The Government must act immediately to provide local authorities with resources to deal with the crisis.</P>
      <P>It is also unfair that families have to live in over-crowded or sub-standard housing while they wait and hope in vain for local authority housing. Action must be taken as it is unfair that single parents with one or more children who wish for some independence have to wait for years for a house. This is one of the most marginalised groups in society and these people struggle to give their children a decent start in life.</P>
      <P>It is also unfair that elderly people do not have housing and are forced to live out their days in squalid conditions. More than 800 people are on the waiting list in County Limerick. More and more people are unable to purchase homes due to mismanagement of the housing crisis in the private housing sector. The situation will get much worse, but the Government seems to have no understanding or sensitivity to those who long to have a decent home of their own. It has a duty and a responsibility to respond to the needs of those people.</P>
      <P>The State ignores the homeless. While the work of the tribunals makes the headlines, surely the biggest scandal of all is that in every city in this country there are homeless children sleeping rough. In Dublin alone, there are 1,250 homeless children. Surely that is a scandal that deserves banner headlines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support this important motion. Increasing the supply of <Col N="426" /> affordable residential housing is imperative. The lack of affordable housing, particularly in large urban areas, is creating serious demands on employees attempting to purchase a house and on employers who are coming under increased pressure to give exorbitant pay increases to finance a potential purchase. As it becomes more expensive to purchase a house, demands on pay rates intensify. That creates a knock-on effect on costs and, in many cases, threatens the competitiveness of indigenous companies.</P>
      <P>Emigrants returning from England and elsewhere who have acquired skills abroad that are in demand here find it difficult to resettle here due to high marginal taxation and the cost of housing. The only financial advantage in their returning home is the sterling-punt exchange rate.</P>
      <P>Coming from Sligo, I am aware that concern has been expressed at the lack of sewerage and water facilities in the towns and villages of the county. The opening up of large tracts of land, not only in Dublin but in other cities, for rezoning for residential purposes would help to alleviate the shortage of affordable residential housing.</P>
      <P>More land should be rezoned for residential purposes in Sligo and throughout the towns and villages of the country. The biggest incentive to encourage developers to proceed with developments is the provision of water and sewerage schemes. Tax incentives apply to parts of south Sligo. Those areas would be greatly enhanced if the Government gave a commitment to provide those facilities. At last Monday's council meeting it was stated that 50 houses could be built in a village in the country, but given that the cost of such development must be borne by the developer, a joint partnership might be&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has a relatively small housing stock, with 334 houses per 1,000 population compared to an estimated EU average of 440 per 1,000 population. We are building houses at by far the highest rate in the EU in proportion to population &ndash; 12.4 houses per 1,000 population were built last year, which is about six times the UK rate.</P>
      <P>House completions in 1999 reached a record 46,512 units nationally. That was the fifth year of record output. Output in Dublin topped 10,000 units last year while completions in the greater Dublin area totalled 15,228 units. The measures taken by the Government to increase housing supply are having the desired effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, however, recognises the <Col N="427" /> challenges that lie ahead. Rapid economic growth, population growth and immigration have all contributed to housing demand. Even though housing output between 1994 and 1999 doubled, more than 500,000 additional houses will need to be built over the next ten years. Those must be planned for and the necessary infrastructure put in place to ensure that bottlenecks are avoided as far as possible in terms of key factors, particularly serviced land. It is necessary not only to build the houses but to do so in a planned and integrated way by providing the necessary transport infrastructure and amenities to form viable new communities or integrate new housing successfully into existing communities. The decisions about where this housing is to be built and how best to manage this process are fundamental to our future economic success and to the kind of society we wish to develop.</P>
    <P>The national spatial strategy being drawn up by the Government will identify broad spatial development patterns for areas and set down policies on the location of residential, industrial and rural developments and tourism and heritage. The strategy will provide the basis for co-ordination and co-operation in policy formulation and particularly in decision-making on major investment in infrastructure, including public and private transportation, infrastructure and major industrial locations. This will be important for the sustainable development of housing and infrastructure required over the long-term.</P>
    <P>A disproportionate number of people are concentrated in the Dublin area. Dublin city has tended to sprawl, making efficient and cost-effective public services, especially public transport, difficult to achieve and community identities difficult to preserve. At the same time, some towns outside the greater Dublin area have stagnated to a degree. We cannot afford to allow this unplanned and unconsidered approach continue in the future. Unless we implement an effective development strategy, unbalanced development of the Dublin area will impose a heavy cost economically and socially. The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area published last year and updated this year provide us with the blueprint to provide the additional housing we need in a planned and balanced way.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Labour Party tabled a motion that proposes to provide a solution to every problem, but it is tellingly silent on how measures should be implemented and it is devoid of even the most basic costings. The Labour Party cannot resist any idea.</P>
    <P>Its proposal for State intervention in building land, in effect, is a proposal to nationalise all development land and pay the market value for it. Local authorities already have the power to acquire land for any of their functions by agreement or by compulsory acquisition. Where land is acquired by compulsory order, the amount paid is its market value. However, the wholesale acquisition of land in the market by local auth<Col N="428" /> orities will serve only to further increase the price of land. Through the Planning and Development Bill, the Government is taking action to ensure the availability of land at its existing use value for social and affordable housing. I commend the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>The motion also conveniently ignores what is being done by the Government in a range of areas referred to, for example, the student accommodation scheme, the initiatives and funding increases to boost the voluntary housing sector and the Commission on the Private Rented Sector. Perhaps the most shameful deception the Labour Party is attempting in this motion is to create the illusion that 50,000 social housing units can be magically produced without reference to capacity considerations or the need for social integration and balance.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to work being carried out by the National Economic and Social Forum. I understand it is working on a report on social housing, which will be available shortly and which will make a valuable contribution to the debate on social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to combating social exclusion. From a housing perspective, as part of the drive to improve local authority housing management, the housing unit was established in March 1998. The remit of the unit is to assist local authorities to develop a more effective operational approach to housing management, which includes the dissemination of best practice guidelines and the preparation of an assessment of training needs for housing practitioners and devising programmes and strategies to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>The housing management initiatives grant scheme is designed to support innovative pilot projects in the area of local authority housing management by way of grant assistance from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Since its inception more than 100 projects have been approved. Approximately 50% of the projects funded to date have involved tenant and staff training in estate management. Other projects included supporting research, production of tenants' handbooks and the employment of tenant liaison officers. Improving local authority estate management and providing for increased tenant participation in this way is making a difference in these estates.</P>
    <P>We in Cork Corporation are committed to providing 1,000 new homes over the next four years as part of our housing strategy. I commend the Minister on his increased allocation to Cork Corporation and Cork County Council. I urge all local authorities to accelerate their house building programmes. I regret that many local authorities are dragging their feet in implementing these programmes. They need to accelerate their implementation in the way the local authorities in my constituency are attempting to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and compliment the Labour Party on introducing it. I hope <Col N="429" /> its enthusiasm on this matter at national level will transmit to its local authority members. For the past few weeks, I have examined zoning in the Dublin area, a very controversial matter. There was a great deal of cynicism about that in the past. This is one of the most difficult and intractable problems that faces any Government. The reality is that one cannot buck the market or create houses overnight. Therefore, we should stop deluding ourselves that there are instant solutions.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on what I regard as an honest and pragmatic approach to what is an extremely difficult problem. I wish to focus on the lower end of the market because I believe the market at the higher end is capable of looking after itself. I shall address a couple of points about the multi-annual local authority housing programmes. The last speaker made the point that he was delighted the Minister had increased the level of capital allocation to local authorities and has given them an indication of a multi-annual fund. I share the difficulty which several Members on all sides have with the capacity of local authorities to deliver efficiently in the housing market. For example, the housing crisis in Wicklow is second to none in the country because Wicklow, particularly the north-east, has become an area of huge market demand. Yet I can walk around in housing estates and find houses boarded up because the management system in the local authority system is not good enough. What I find really perverse is that there is at least one or perhaps two houses which were completed last year and have not been allocated. In one case the local authority involved, my own county council, is using it as a storage space. That is virtually criminal behaviour for a local authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to operate a tight audit on the capacity of local authorities to deliver. Local authorities which are serious about this problem should front-load their building programme and respond quickly. I am aware, having looked at a number of local authorities in the past few days, that many are not up to date yet with their 1998 allocation. That is a scandal.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the question of voluntary housing. Many years ago when I was a young man and was first engaged, we were looking for a house. At that time, in the early 1970s, there was a housing crisis in Dublin. I became involved in and was an enthusiastic supporter of housing co-operatives. Housing co-operatives have virtually died the death. In small towns and villages in particular and in parts of Wicklow, parts of Kildare and in other towns in the greater Dublin area the local authorities should become pro-active to help foster a co-operative spirit to try to bring on stream housing capacity that exists in those towns and villages, which is waiting to be developed. I would argue strongly the need for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An earlier speaker described the shared ownership scheme as a joke and the affordable housing scheme as non-viable. I regret these negative views. The shared ownership scheme has been <Col N="430" /> innovative. There is a problem with it in the greater Dublin area and in parts of Cork and parts of Galway where there are high house price values. I believe that is happening and the Department needs to review it. The shared ownership scheme should be more cognisant of the existing market prices and a better mechanism will have to be introduced.</P>
    <P>There was reference to serviced land &ndash; that runs through the motion and the amendment tabled by the Government. The reality is that there is something of a cartel in the bigger cities about serviced land. My view is that the people who own land which is serviced should use it or lose it. I shall make that point later tonight on the Planning and Development Bill. I welcome the idea that 20% of land is to be allocated for low cost and affordable housing. I detect something of a schizophrenic attitude here, some of which is based on snobbery. People do not want this to happen. There is a crisis and we, as legislators, have to take the lead. Even if it offends some, we have to insist that the 20% requirement goes through. It was incorporated in the last county development plan in County Wicklow. I am pushing that requirement, as are councillors from all parties.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of liquidity in the second-hand market. Many young people are forced into the second-hand market because it is the only place they can buy houses in their own location. The question of stamp duty requires attention. Stamp duty was never intended to be a windfall tax for the Government. The reality is that due to escalating house prices, the stamp duty system has, effectively, become a penalty. I would prefer a more benign system for a first time buyer forced into the second-hand market. At the end of the day all the debates and all the speeches in the world will not resolve this problem. A resolution can be found. A number of mechanisms are being put in place by the Government. I urge those at local authority level in particular, Members of the House and members of parties represented here to press actively to employ those mechanisms.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is welcome. It comes at a time when 1,000 new houses are being built each week. It also gives the Government an opportunity to highlight its record since taking office three years ago and to outline the policies it will pursue. Having listened to some of the Opposition speakers last night, one would think the Government sat on its hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a difficult issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very difficult issue and being in Government brings with it responsibility. It is the responsibility of the Government to tackle <Col N="431" /> the problem and the job of the Opposition to correct the Government and point it in the right direction. Opposition parties always see the barrel as half empty. Now that we are in the middle of a by-election the barrel is empty. I like to think my contributions here are reasonably balanced. I realise that not everything in the garden is rosy, that the Government parties do not have all the answers and that the Opposition does not have all the answers either.</P>
      <P>The housing shortage remains a major concern for the Government. It is committed to a comprehensive housing policy which maximises housing output and supply throughout the country and actively promotes affordable housing. In Ireland more than in other countries there is a great desire to own one's home. This desire should be encouraged and assisted at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>In his contribution last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, referred to the private rented residential sector. He indicated that the commission established last year was due to report on 1 June 2000 but the chairman has sought an extension of time. That commission was asked to examine and make recommendations on many issues relating to the sector. The Government has given a commitment to act on those recommendations. This is an area where action is necessary. While I realise it is all about striking a balance between the rights of landlords and tenants, I am aware from meeting people on a regular basis that time and again landlords abuse their position. Kildare is no different from many other areas in that it has a shortage of rented housing accommodation. Those in vulnerable positions, such as single mothers who may have to leave home and find accommodation, are often prepared to accept anything. Unfortunately, landlords facilitate them and often allow single mothers or young families into accommodation unsuitable for animals. They make all kinds of promises but they are seldom honoured. The manner in which landlords abuse their position was highlighted recently on a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. When the commission reports I expect the Government will act immediately on its recommendations.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for those on low incomes or in receipt of social welfare payments to seek rental subsidy for accommodation. There is a distinct lack of accommodation in that sector. I would like to see an increase in supply so landlords will not be allowed get away with the skullduggery taking place in many towns and villages throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned how seriously the Government takes this issue and An Action Programme for the Millennium clearly states our intention to promote strategic development in locations outside Dublin on an economically self-sustaining basis to restrain demand in Dublin. This is important for a number of reasons. There is no one answer but a number of policies pursued by the Government will bring that about. The decen<Col N="432" /> tralisation programme, for which I hope my county will be chosen, is important and will have a positive impact on the areas selected. It is important that before those areas are selected we think about the quality of life of the people involved. We must try to put in place facilities to which people are accustomed. We cannot expect to have the facilities in towns which those living in cities enjoy. However, we must make decentralisation attractive if it is to work.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the availability of land and owners sitting on zoned land. It is important that land is made available as quickly as possible. Development land is being sold for astronomical sums and new home owners are paying the price. In many cases, the prices demanded for new houses do not make sense and are placing a great strain on young couples starting their lives together. The introduction of the 20% clause by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in the Planning and Development Bill will ease the situation enormously and increase the number of social and affordable houses. This will have a positive effect and will take the sting out of what is happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion. We do not have all the answers &ndash; perhaps we sometimes pretend we have but we have not. I welcome the other contributions.</P>

      <P>These are the people preaching to us about how to solve the housing crisis when their ideological opposition to rezoning on <Col N="433" /> all fronts in the County Dublin area has led directly to the current supply side shortage.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party record on rezoning is not covered with glory. Despite all the moralising and preaching from across the House, I do not believe their record stands up to scrutiny. This Government's record stands up to detailed scrutiny. When the rainbow coalition had the opportunity to do something about rezoning and bringing affordable housing on stream, it ignored the problem. Its treatment of the issue of social housing was exactly the same as its attitude towards refugees and its failure to act on that issue. The failures of the last Government, led by Deputy John Bruton, are exemplified in its attitude towards the issues of housing and refugees. These problems were analysed and identified and nothing was done by the magical rainbow coalition which came into existence by some sort of democratic coup in 1994. That is the reality of the record of the people preaching across the House, preaching to our party which is getting on with the business of redressing the serious imbalances which exist.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that people who passed section 4 motions to bring housing into commission in the 1980s were wrong to do so. However, there seems to be an attitude on the Opposition benches, and to a certain extent among the media and public commentators, that to rezone or pass a section 4 motion was wrong. It was the right thing to do. I notice that none of those crowing about the events and revelations at the Flood tribunal in Dublin Castle and who speak so eloquently against what happened in the 1980s &ndash; if anyone has accepted an inducement to make a decision, no one is standing over it here &ndash; is asking for the housing developments to be pulled down or magically converted to green space. The reality is that most of those developments were necessary and had to go ahead in the face of ideological opposition to rezoning &ndash; I notice Deputy Gilmore in the Chamber.</P>

      <P>There was to be no rezoning whatsoever. What would homelessness be like in this city if the Labour Party got its way on the council? There would have been no rezoning and no homes for anyone to go to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has acted swiftly to address the problem which it inherited. It immediately instigated two in-depth reports on the housing issue which made a number of radical recommendations that were acted upon. A third report by Dr. Peter Bacon is expected to be published tomorrow, containing recommendations for further measures to increase affordable housing supply. Among the significant measures intro<Col N="434" /> duced by this Government was the serviced land initiative which will yield over 115,000 sites as opposed to the original target of 100,000 sites. The scheme has the potential to further exceed that total by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>According to a recent departmental survey, there is now enough serviced land in the four Dublin local authority areas to support about four years' output at 1999 levels, which were exceptional. Indications from elsewhere around the country are also positive. The supply side initiatives introduced by this Government, such as the serviced land initiative, temporary treatment facilities, sewerage projects, new residential density guidelines, more recourse to infill housing, which has lesser demand in terms of site servicing, and so on are all making a contribution to the vast increase in our housing stock. Current indications are that 55,000 units will be required per annum in the next ten years rather than the 50,000 forecast two years ago.</P>
    <P>To secure the level of housing construction to meet future demand, it will be necessary to secure implementation by local authorities of the planning guidelines on residential density issued last September. I hope the local authorities go ahead with these. I do not agree with the dual mandate but as I look around the House, I see many people who seem to enjoy holding the dual mandate of sitting in the Dáil and on county councils.</P>

      <P>I found the last speech particularly interesting for its sheer honesty and, now that we are encouraged to speak plainly, neck. Any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who begins a speech this month with the words &ldquo;Rezone, rezone, rezone&rdquo; must get a medal for the thickness of his or her neck. Something very interesting will happen in this House when we vote at 8.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Among the many proposals tabled by the Labour Party in this motion, Members will be asked to vote on Labour's call for the establishment of publicly owned landbanks for each local authority. That is lodged in the middle of a comprehensive set of proposals dealing with, for example, State intervention in building land, price control on new housing, regulation of the housing market, the establishment of a national housing authority, strengthening the voluntary housing sector, the private rented sector, transient accommodation, local authority and social housing and reform of housing benefit and administration.</P>
      <P>I have selected this particular element because it is the one that will sort people out very quickly. The issue the public should look at is whether people vote for landbanks. The last speaker did not mention why the land that has already been rezoned is not being released for the building of houses. The answer is that it is being hoarded for speculative profit. One can flap one's wings like Daffy Duck or Deputy Conor Lenihan, but one will not change that. Tonight Deputy Lenihan will vote for either the speculators' further profit or for those who want to put a roof over their heads.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party's motion contains a comprehensive set of proposals. Deputies are asked unequivocally to decide which gets priority, housing rights or the freedom to speculate on a basic and scarce resource that affects almost every family in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get real about this. Half the cost of a housing unit at present is represented by the site cost. Controlling the cost of the site is the only real measure that will substantially increase the <Col N="436" /> supply of housing that our people need. Our proposal, which we will vote on at 8.30 p.m., is reasonable, moral and achievable. It should, as a minimum, be interpreted in the spirit of the Kenny report of some decades ago. Where, for example, our motion refers to compulsory purchase powers, it should be interpreted as the right to purchase at a pre-speculative level, at original designation price plus a reasonably adjudged premium.</P>
    <P>Our present crisis, denied by the Government for so long, has been the subject of a campaign by us for over a year. We did not produce this motion for the by-election. We had the Drudy report &ndash; I pay tribute to Professor Drudy for the public service he did in chairing our commission on housing. Our crisis, which was acknowledged by Deputy Roche this evening &ndash; apparently, the ability to see a crisis is breaking out in Wicklow &ndash; was attested to in my city by over 2,500 signatories.</P>
    <P>However, from listening to the speeches tonight, would one think the housing lists had increased nationally to over 60,000 and that many are in despair at ever having a home, in a society that constitutes the third largest market in Europe for luxury cars? That is an obscenity. A couple with a joint income of £40,000 cannot afford a home in the private housing market. The Taoiseach is reported in a newspaper this morning as acknowledging that £5 billion out of the £11 billion housing market is speculative money. The Government has been forced to acknowledge what has been a Labour Party campaign for well over a year, that we have a housing crisis. It should now go further and admit it is in the market's interest to exploit this crisis.</P>
    <P>There is only one radical approach to the housing crisis, which is to build houses for those who need them. To do this effectively, we need to drive out the speculative capital from the hoarding of building land and not reward it, as the Government has done, by reducing capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder what the Taoiseach and his Ministers think when they are strutting their new version of Ireland around the world, a version where the economy does so well and many in society do so badly. Do they ever speak of how more than 250,000 people are affected by the housing crisis, if one multiplies the average family size by the number on the housing lists? Do they ever get concerned at the fact that, in the wealthiest period in our history, this generation and the ones that follow will lose the right to ever have a home, that the number without shelter on the streets has doubled from 2,500 in 1996 to over 5,000 in 1999 and that the average house price in the Taoiseach's beloved Dublin has increased from £73,500 when he took office to £124,000 at present? Or does that matter? Maybe it does not.</P>
    <P>We heard the answer from Deputy Lenihan, that the markets will sort it out. They will, indeed. He also said that Fianna Fáil is getting on with the job and is doing the business. It certainly did <Col N="437" /> the business for those who made speculative gains out of human need. Even the most shameless of Ministers should feel ashamed of the facts I have just read out. This is the mark of a republic with the fastest growth rate in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will not end its housing campaign if we do not win the vote this evening. We will campaign publicly with the support of those who share our concerns, the trade union movement, voluntary housing organisations, churches and many others, to advance the ten principles of our proposals tonight.</P>
    <P>Those principles include the need for State intervention in building land through the establishment of public landbanks and the need to establish a national housing authority to help provide the 500,000 new dwellings estimated to be needed over the next ten years. This is practical recognition that some local authorities are not delivering even their existing targets. There is also a need for the control of new house prices through a fair price certification process and for the regulation of standards of entry into the building industry and of performance, quality, proper management and design. Local authority and social housing programmes must be front-loaded to address the current waiting list of more than 60,000 people. There must be delivery to the voluntary sector of the means for a tenfold increase in its current outturn of about 500 houses per year. We need to reform housing administration, with a clear specification of functions between local authorities and health boards. Additional staff and specialised training to deal with the distress of applicants whom the developed economy has failed must be provided. We need fair, transparent and manageable legislation for the private rented sector, that gives certainty of tenure to the tenant and guarantees a responsible compliance to the provider. We need to provide purpose built accommodation for students, transients and those with special needs. We need the restructuring of housing benefit in an integrated way, so as to take account of the accommodation needs of families in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>The sad part is that we could do it all by any one of several means of funding. For example, what we spend on rent allowance could be done through borrowings. We could also invest the pension funds that we propose to invest abroad.</P>
    <P>This evening Deputies are invited to be radical. They can vote to make the scarce resource of building land a public asset or they can leave that same land to the speculators to continue the same old disastrous story. Each Deputy has to choose where he or she stands. There are many who honestly believe it should be left to the market, but we do not. Those who oppose our proposal should reflect on how radical their latest list of inducements to those who speculate really is. I ask them to visualise two sets of Irish people. On one side are those who need housing, who are borrowing beyond their means, no longer have the choice to work at home or in the traded econ<Col N="438" /> omy, who drive from dawn to dusk, are anxious for their children and are prisoners of an economy that will not allow them a home. On the other side are the speculators with £5 billion of blood money on their greedy hands.</P>
    <P>Members of the Labour Party know where they stand. If there is to be a cost to our proposals, let it be carried by those who are committed to private greed and who put it above the public good.</P>

      <P>I missed a vote on the planning Bill this evening because I was attempting to deal with a constituent who returned with his wife and family from England last year. He returned to employment but found he could not get housing. As a result, he went into private rented accommodation. As he needed a health board subsidy to survive in that accommodation, he could not take up the employment. If he did, he would lose the subsidy.</P>
      <P>Today, 12 months later, he was evicted from the house. The 12 month lease has expired. His wife had their third baby last week. She now has three small children, the youngest being seven days old. The housing manager of South Dublin County Council informed me that my constituent is 1035th on the waiting list. Tonight that constituent has gone to Charles Street with his wife and three children, including the seven day old baby, to register as homeless. Charles Street is the only prospect of this family being housed. That reality is being repeated throughout this city and country. That is the success of the economy about which the Minister for Finance invites us to party. The reality is that people whose parents managed to access mortgages in the past cannot dream of access to housing finance in the present economy.</P>
      <P>We could have spent this evening describing the extent of the crisis, given its scale, and offering that type of personal history. We did not do that because Deputy Gilmore set out in comprehensive detail a strategy for the future. This derives from the Drudy report commissioned by Deputy Gilmore and the Labour Party. It has taken a long time to come through the system. This Government has failed lamentably to tackle the scale of the crisis. We were told that Bacon 1 would do it. All it did was drive the private rented sector out of the reach of ordinary people. We were then told that Bacon 2 would do it but it has achieved little. Now we are told to await Bacon 3 and that all will be well. We know it will not be right and it is a cruel and monstrous Niagara of distortion to visit on ordinary people to suggest that it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have spent tonight focusing on the peculiar nexus of Fianna Fáil, the builders, developers and the industry but that is being talked about elsewhere and there is no point in dwelling on it. It is clear, however, that this Government will not confront that lobby. Of all the proposals advanced by Deputy Gilmore, undoubtedly the <Col N="439" /> most significant is the intervention in building land as identified by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Roche and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers read the little scripts prepared for them by central office and speaking about how great they are. Deputy Roche is in especially triumphal mood since his <i>magnum opus</i>. He is poncing around as if he were a candidate for the Booker prize. Now he has discovered there is a housing crisis in Wicklow. He also said he is in favour of co-ops. I will quote from a letter we received from NABCo, one of the best established house building co-operatives. It states:</P>
    <P>For the first time in ten years no new co-operative rental housing projects are being planned in either the Fingal or the Dublin South County areas due to the lack of designation of sites to enable planning of more new projects to be started.</P>

They are part of the circle of greed that is driving housing out of the reach of ordinary people. The Competition Authority should look at the cartel being operated by the big five, sometimes in league with the advertising supplements of the main newspapers, to assist the psychosis.</P>
      <P>This is a scandal. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has been talking for three years about addressing it. It is worse as a result of all the factors outlined last night by Deputy Gilmore, whether it is the extent of price rises, the number of people on waiting lists, the fact that the number of homeless has doubled and so forth. It is a scandal that will persist after tonight's debate because the Government has clearly indicated that it will not take any radical measures to address it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Chair's support in this regard. I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on housing. Ireland is in the middle of perhaps its greatest housing crisis but even as it deepens on a monthly basis, the Government is only now recognising its existence. A Bacon 3 report is imminent. What was the effect of Bacon 1 and 2?</P>
      <P>Since the Government took office, the average price of a new house has increased by 70%. In Dublin, the price of new and secondhand houses increased by almost £30,000 last year. The cost of private rented accommodation has increased by more than 50% and there is an increase of nearly 25,000 applicants on local authority housing lists. These figures clearly demonstrate that a majority of prospective first time buyers are excluded from the housing market because they do not have the income capacity to meet the mortgage requirements for the most modest house.</P>
      <P>Radical solutions are required with regard to price control, housing land supply, planning, public housing, private owner occupancy, tenants' rights and the elimination of stamp duty for first time buyers of secondhand houses. The latter would improve the situation substantially for many people on modest earnings who are fortunate enough to find a modestly priced house.</P>
      <P>The price of serviced land is the most significant factor in the cost of a house. I was involved with the Donabate housing co-op which secured serviced sites over the years for Fingal County Council and Dublin County Council. The most recent scheme was built last year and members took up occupancy on 1 January this year. The overall cost of the three bedroom semi-detached house came to £60,000. The cost of the same type of house in the same area on the open market would be £140,000. This clearly demonstrates the cost of sites and the need for local authorities to assemble publicly owned land banks capable of supplying serviced land to facilitate all forms of housing development, including private housing, affordable housing, social housing and voluntary and co-operative housing.</P>
      <P>It is immoral that the market value of an acre of land can increase tenfold because of zoning changes, particularly as the owner does not add to the value of the land, apart perhaps from paying contributions to some councillors.</P>
      <P>The Government has not demonstrated the will to deal with this problem. Therefore, it should either change its housing policy and deal with the reality which exists at present or else get out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of the Government the All-Party Committee on the Constitution has spent a considerable length of time considering the needs of the unborn, the status of the unborn and the issue of abortion, and rightly so. It is ironic that so much attention is being paid to the rights of the unborn while the rights of the born are so sadly neglected. Some Members have <Col N="441" /> spoken about housing policy but it is important to remember that we are talking about people. There is a hierarchy of needs, at the top of which are the needs of children. As every politician who runs a clinic knows, more often than not it is the children of parents with a housing crisis who are brought to our clinics. The need for housing is not just about a roof over one's head, it means stability, good health and access to education. This has a ripple effect and, if this need is not met, tremendous difficulties will be created for children growing up now. The experience they have as small babies and schoolgoing children because of a housing crisis which is impacting directly on their lives will be carried with them right through into adulthood. Therefore, the impact the lack of housing has on individuals and families cannot be described sufficiently.</P>
      <P>One of the aspects of the housing crisis which is now very noticeable is that it is impacting on elderly people. I have never before seen the kinds of problems elderly people in their eighties and nineties are now facing. This is a new feature compared to the last 25 or 30 years. Very elderly people are now living in very poor quality accommodation and do not have a chance of realising their dream of living in proper accommodation before they die.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate and believe the housing issue will be the yardstick by which the Government is measured and judged at election time. When the Government took office the housing need had been stabilised for the first time in years. The assessment of housing need indicates this fact. A special initiative was established to deal with the needs of the homeless. At that point homelessness had reached nothing like the level it is at now. I do not wish to detain the House for too long because other Members wish to speak and much of what was said was well put. However, whatever about buzzwords such as strategies, initiatives, multi-annual budgets and so on in the Government amendment, the experience of members of local authorities is very clear. I am astonished at how little has changed at local authority level during the term of this Government. I see no evidence of the seismic shift required at local authority level to meet what is now a serious housing crisis. This has not happened and no matter what the Government is putting forward in its amendment, that is my experience and, interestingly, it is the experience to which Deputy Roche referred.</P>
      <P>There is a difference between allocating money and making sure that money is spent. This point needs to be addressed in terms of what the Government is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for affording me the opportunity to make my point on housing. This has been a lengthy debate and I do not wish to repeat what others have said. I wish to put on the record that I tried to make my point in Wexford County Council last Tuesday. However, I was obstructed from doing so by the <Col N="442" /> Fianna Fáil Party and the meeting had to be adjourned.</P>
      <P>The present position in Wexford County Council is as follows. Our main town is Wexford and the position in relation to housing in Wexford Corporation is that there are 77 applications for one-bedroom houses, 101 applications for two-bedroom houses and 111 applications for three-bedroom houses. Some 200 applications have not yet been examined. This amounts to almost 500 applications. The position in New Ross, which has a small population, is considerably worse where there are applications for 500 houses. There are applications for 160 houses in Enniscorthy. Wexford County Council currently has a list of 690 applicants and 250 applications have not yet been examined.</P>
      <P>The housing waiting list in Wexford County Council has grown from 900 to approximately 1,500 in 18 months. I accept there may be some duplication as far as the three urban areas are concerned. However, these are the facts and this is the record of the present Government. I did not take into account the full term of the Government, just the past 18 months. Radical policies need to be introduced to change this serious situation.</P>
      <P>In order to remedy the current acute housing shortage, the Government decided to introduce affordable houses. Let us consider what this will achieve. The interpretation of &ldquo;eligible persons&rdquo; is very broad and could include most of the population, depending on house prices in the area of purchase. Housing strategies are to be incorporated into the development plan, which I accept is a positive step, but the balance of economic and commercial strategies also need to be incorporated into the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy D'Arcy for allowing me to make a brief contribution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Conor Lenihan uttered three words here, &ldquo;rezone, rezone, rezone&rdquo;. He is wrong and totally out of touch. He should have uttered the words, &ldquo;policy, policy, policy&rdquo;. The Minister's policy has failed and the sooner he recognises that fact the sooner we can make a fresh start. I wish to point out to Deputies that this is a national problem, a countrywide problem, not just a problem for Dublin city. There are other options to be explored. The Government is sitting on its hands repeating, &ldquo;Bacon 1 and Bacon 2&rdquo;. Wait for Bacon 3 when he will bring home the bacon. This is a cop-out, an excuse for doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will be judged on its failure to provide adequate and decent housing for young couples. It is a sad reflection on the Government that a young couple with a joint income of £30,000 can no longer afford a home. This is the point we have reached. There are options available to the Government. What is wrong with starter homes or affordable houses and what happened to the shared ownership concept? This has not worked and should be <Col N="443" /> revamped because young couples were interested in it. The 50-50 option is out so why is there not an alternative option? There are options in relation to the number of sites available. The impression is being given that no land is available. In areas around this city or outside it there are sites for sale and applications for outline planning permission. The Government maintains that services are not available but this is the chicken and egg syndrome. Services can be provided. It does not have to be a piped service. There are options in relation to sewage disposal through the Bord na Móna concept. This will be costly but why will the Government not provide a grant to young couples who are prepared to move outside the pale to build a home? It is waiting for Bacon who will not come up with that option because obviously if Bacon 1 and 2 failed, Bacon 3 will be a bigger failure. It is not good enough for the Minister of State to sit there smiling. We expect a little more from the Minister, and the young people we represent expect a great deal more. I hope the Minister will deliver on the constructive proposals in the Labour Party motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's approach has already produced noteworthy results. House completions in 1999 reached a record 46,512 units nationally, almost 40% more than in 1996, the last full year the rainbow Government was in office. We have achieved the private housing output target we set of 43,000 units in 1999, which was the target level of output set in the first Bacon report and the indications are that the upward trend in <Col N="444" /> new house completions is set to continue. In spite of continuing high demand, the effects of increased output are reflected in significantly moderating house price trends since house price inflation peaked in 1998. Average prices for the first quarter of 2000 in Dublin are showing reductions for both new and second-hand homes, the first time that average prices have dropped since 1995.</P>
      <P>The House heard many calls last evening for the introduction of controls on the price of new houses and rents. The populist notion of new house price control discredits its proponents. What happens when the new house becomes a second-hand house? The Government is acting to curb speculation in housing: artificial control on the price of new houses would facilitate it.</P>
      <P>Rent control proved disastrous for the private rented sector here, as it did in other countries in which it was imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, pointed out last evening, other EU countries are now trying to get rid of any vestiges of rent control which have sent their private rented sectors into decline. This emerged clearly from an international conference on the private rented sector arranged by Threshold last year. The single most important point is that rent controls would hinder attempts to increase the supply of rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Government, instead of nationalising all the building land, has introduced provisions in Part V of the Planning and Development Bill which recognise the value of land is significantly increased by a local authority decision to zone it. The greater community, through the local authority, should be able to reap for the public good, an appropriate proportion of the gain conferred on the landowner. The simple fact is that the Labour Party proposals in this motion will neither bring land into development more quickly nor allow local authorities acquire land at a cheaper cost than can currently be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

Thanks to the Government freeing up second-hand houses for sale through reducing stamp duty, following the imposition of punitive rates for all purchasers by the previous Government, the choice of housing available to first time buyers has been greatly expanded.</P>
      <P>Investment in the local authority and social housing programmes is more than £440 million this year, almost two and half times the £180 million the previous Government provided in the 1997 Estimates.

      <P>I propose to share time with Deputies Quinn and Gilmore. I am amazed at the speech by the Minister, who is responsible for what were known as &ldquo;Molloy's botháns&rdquo;, which had no chimneys and the walls of which were made of cardboard.

      <P>As this debate proceeds, thousands of people are still sitting in traffic after a hard day at work. Many of these frustrated motorists now live in Kildare. <i>En route</i> from Dublin based jobs they are under pressure to pick up their children from the childminders where they parked them at some unearthly hour this morning. Once these people get home tonight they will be so exhausted they will just about have the energy to prepare for the next day. Tomorrow morning they will again rise early, dispatch their children to the childminder and sit in traffic for up to one and a half hours before getting to work. Those planning to take the train to work will be lucky to find standing room.</P>
      <P>Not all these people to whom I refer want to live in Kildare. Many would have preferred to live in an area with more convenient access to their workplaces and where they would be closer to their families and friends. However, because of the absolute failure of the Government to even acknowledge that we have a housing crisis, people are being reluctantly forced to make life choices to live and bring up their families outside Dublin city where they work.</P>
      <P>The cost of housing in Dublin has forced people to look for a home up to 50 miles from their place of work. As an offshoot of spiralling house prices in Dublin, houses in Celbridge and Maynooth have become unaffordable for working families. The result is that people with jobs and families in these towns are being squeezed out of the housing market. Most people living in these towns could not afford to buy their current houses and their children have no chance of buying a house.</P>
      <P>If our roads network, public transport and infrastructure were adequate perhaps commuting would allow for an efficient journey to work. However, the reality is that our infrastructure is barely playing catch-up with the needs of commuters.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party motion is about introducing a sense of reality to the housing market and about giving people greater choice about where they live. It provides for the establishment of publicly owned land banks which would ensure our future housing needs are catered for. It would put an end to hundreds of acres of land which has been rezoned for housing remaining undeveloped and to the cartel of landowners in Dublin who will not release a sufficient amount of zoned land for development and who are distorting the market to their own advantage to satisfy their greed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion also does something to which the Government has been adverse since taking office. We are proposing a realistic local authority building programme which will meet demands. Our land bank would provide private sites for young couples to build their own houses and land for co-operatives and affordable housing, in addition <Col N="447" /> to land for houses directly built by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office the number of families in County Kildare alone who are waiting for local authority houses has soared by 800. Under the Government the expectation of even securing a home is entirely bleak. There are now 2,000 families on the house waiting list in Kildare, amounting to 6,000 men, women and children. Under the programme of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, we are building 160 houses per year. Therefore, it will take 15 years to clear the backlog in Kildare at the current rate of progress.</P>
    <P>My weekly clinics are now frequented by young working couples who previously could afford to buy their own homes but who have been driven out of the market by the greed of speculators and landowners who are supported by the Government. They do not qualify for local authority housing, cannot afford to buy private housing and are forced into the largely unregulated private rented sector where rents are now between £650 and £800 per month. They have no security of tenure and are regularly turfed out at the whim of the landlord, similar to the case referred to by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>The Government has the resources and has wasted opportunities. It should take our guidance and return to people the right to a home in their own country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who has responsibility for housing I do not know whether I should be sad because a man has given his life to public office or angry because of his extraordinary complacency in delivering the official statement of the Government. It mystifies me that a person who has immense popular appeal in his constituency, served his country in many different capacities, including as Minister for Local Government, and had the courage to break with the corrupt Haughey regime of the Fianna Fáil Party can believe such arrant nonsense.</P>
      <P>There is a housing crisis. The problem has been growing since the day the Government took office. In the wonderful Gandon splendour of the Custom House not one single housing expert could be found to advise on policy. We had to go instead to Dr. Bacon whose report, as some had predicted, exacerbated the problem. He was then asked to produce a second which did not do much more and, unlike Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty who was given only two chances, he was given a third chance. Bacon 3 is to be published tomorrow. The Minister of State did not have the courage or honesty to admit that it will be highly critical of the impact of the policies of the Government led by the most arrogant Minister for Finance this country has ever seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am angry because the Government is squandering time and the ability to solve the problems which, if they are not already doing so, will wreck the marriages of young couples forced to live in <Col N="448" /> lousy or overcrowded accommodation and the educational prospects of children who simply cannot do their homework in overcrowded conditions and which will undoubtedly impose other stresses and strains on our social fabric. It will take years of psychiatric and psychological care and nurturing to undo the damage.</P>
    <P>The response of Fianna Fáil has been that the market will solve everything. We cannot wait for that to happen. Market mechanisms do not always work or, if they do, they do not work quickly enough. We have not tabled a by-election special motion as some have suggested. We have tabled a measured, considered and well thought out motion based on a report which I commend to the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and which he should read in detail. He will then see that nowhere in the motion do we propose price control, as such. What he was referring to was the freezing of rents. We want the regulatory system that applies to the private commercial sector to apply to the private housing rental sector. In every shopping centre throughout the country commercial leases are regulated and controlled and prices can only be increased by reference to specific cost indicators. We are proposing no more, no less.</P>
    <P>The repeated misrepresentation by the Government of our well thought out proposals indicates its ideological and policy bankruptcy, which is its hallmark. It is so bankrupt that it has even privatised the making of policy. We will receive Dr. Bacon's third report tomorrow and the Minister of State did not have the courage or the decency to indicate its condemnatory contents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Members who supported the Labour Party motion on housing last night and tonight. The response of the Government has been absolutely pathetic. The Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Dan Wallace, sang the same old song: &ldquo;Blame the previous Government, attack the Labour Party.&rdquo;  They then informed us about all the things the Government will do or is thinking about doing about housing. The Government has been in office for three years. When one has been in office for three years it is too late to blame one's predecessor and to indicate what one will do. One has to stand on one's record, and the record of the Government on housing is shameful.</P>
      <P>In the motion we propose a ten point strategy which needs to be pursued if the housing crisis is to be resolved. The Government has tabled an amendment on which we will vote in less than five minutes. It asks Dáil Éireann to do three things. It asks us to acknowledge the housing achievements of the Government, to welcome its housing strategy and support its policy on housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>House prices in this city, rents, <Col N="449" /> the numbers on housing lists and the numbers who are homeless on our streets have doubled since the Government took office. It has put buying a home beyond the reach of young people on good incomes. These are the achievements that the Minister is asking Dáil Éireann to acknowledge. He is also asking us to support and welcome the Government's housing strategy and housing policy. Where is its housing strategy and housing policy? The Government has been floundering since it took office. The Minister of State informed us tonight that he has dealt with the issue several times. On each occasion he told us that house prices were going down and asked us if we had seen the figures for the previous quarter. As he continued to tell the House that house prices were going down, they were increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion has had at least one beneficial effect. It has forced the Government to bring forward Bacon 3 and arrange a press conference for tomorrow to announce its provisions. The only reason we have Bacon 3 is that Bacon 1 and 2 have failed. The Government is much better at arranging press conferences than dealing with the issue of housing construction. I hope the more gullible and naive sections of the media which tended to buy the previous Government line on housing will not fall for whatever short-term convenient measures are announced. The housing crisis is not capable of being addressed by small <Col N="450" /> changes in stamp duty. What has been needed for some time is a coherent national housing strategy similar to that contained in the motion.</P>
    <P>The House has a simple choice to make. It can either vote for the Government amendment which asks it to support a continuation of the failed housing policies of the Government or it can vote for an alternative, a comprehensive ten point strategy across the entire range of housing tenures which would deal with the legislation which has to be introduced, the management of housing, the accelerated and increased public and social housing programme which needs to be put in place and the problem of land speculation, which is at the heart of rising house prices. Sooner or later this country will have to deal with land speculation which has driven the price of houses beyond the reach of young people, corrupted the planning system and left us with towns and cities where proper community facilities and social amenities have not been provided because of sheer bad planning based on greed that is inherent in that land speculation. That is the choice the House must make. If it is in favour of the Labour Party motion it will be to the benefit of those who are at present squeezed out of the housing market and who are languishing on housing lists for God knows how much longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 178:</P>
      <P>In page 104, line 2, to delete &ldquo;<i>section 95(7)</i> or <i>(8)</i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>section 95(8) </i>or <i>(9)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The group of amendments we are addressing covers Part V, which deals with social and affordable housing and the desire of the Government &ndash; I think it is a desire shared across the House. While we might differ on the methods or approaches we would adopt, we are all agreed on the necessity to try to facilitate, as much as possible, the provision of social and affordable housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the thrust and central part of this Bill, one of the core items is Part V which deals with social and affordable housing. We had a long discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and a long and lively discussion on it on the other Stages in this and the other House. Basically, the approach the Government decided to pursue, while mindful of constitutional and other difficulties which might arise, was to put in place a <Col N="455" /> system where the local authority would draw up a housing strategy which would attempt to outline all the housing needs of the local authority area. Having done that, while mindful of the zoned land in the area, it would then make a decision as to the amount of land which should be made available for social and affordable housing and that it would be provided on the basis of the same percentage of existing land use value.</P>
    <P>As Members will know, there has been much discussion on the section and on whether the section, as it stands, is constitutional. I note that most parties seem to have come around to the point of view that it is constitutional because some of the parties opposite are suggesting other remedies which are, to say the least, dubious constitutionally. We have, in this section, come up with a system for securing land at existing use value which is constitutional because it is fair and proportional to the needs and the common good.</P>
    <P>A number of issues arose in respect of which we have tabled amendments and I will briefly refer to some of them. Amendment No. 184 to section 93 expands on section 93(3)(<i>a</i>) to provide that the housing strategy will have to take into account the existing need and future need for affordable housing as well as the existing and future need for social housing. While the other provision in the section might cover this, it was felt important to state it expressly. Deputy Gilmore, in particular, raised this on Committee Stage. He felt it might have to be clarified and, on reflection, we tabled this amendment to indicate clearly that it is social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>This is the most important section of the Bill, certainly from a housing point of view. Some Deputies have criticised the fact that we approached this in this way. Deputy Gilmore mentioned on more than one occasion that it will be three years before any of this affordable housing comes on the market because of the way we are doing this. I reiterate that we have already produced draft guidelines in relation to the housing strategy for each of the local authority areas. A number of local authorities &ndash; certainly most of the larger ones &ndash; are already doing draft housing strategies to fit in with this. I expect that within three to six months of the passing of this Bill and within the period of its commencement quite a few local authorities will have housing strategies in place and will be able to use the provisions contained in this Part to ensure land is obtained by the local authority at a reasonable level or price and that they will be able to reflect that in their housing prices.</P>
    <P>As I said, we discussed this Part in great detail before and I do not intend to go into it in any further detail other than to state those general principles. When I get the opportunity to reply, I may be able to refer to a number of the specifics the Deputies may want to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this Part of the Bill. It does not commend itself to me as, in any sense, a <Col N="456" /> well thought out or well founded appraoch to the problems we have in the housing market today. It is worthwhile looking at some of the things giving rise to hype in the housing market today. I heard, for example, only a small part of a discussion on a radio programme the other evening on which various experts and pundits were arguing with each other about the situation in the housing market. One of them said &ndash; it is commonly said in this House today &ndash; that young people cannot afford to buy houses, which is true. We all know young people who cannot afford to buy a house these days, and even not so young people. I would hate to be out in the market looking to buy a house these days, and I say that in the knowledge that I am already in the race, so to speak, in that I own a house. Another one of the experts commented &ndash; he was quite right &ndash; that there are thousands of people buying houses and that they are not all speculators.</P>
      <P>We have had quite a dose over the last year or so of comments about speculators in the housing market. Anybody who buys more than one house these days or who buys a house that he or she does not intend to live in is called a speculator. Many people, however, have a different view of them because they are landlords and are people from whom they are going to rent a house. All of a sudden, just because there is much tension in the housing market &ndash; this happens at times of tension in the housing market and of economic slump &ndash; those who own property and rent it out to others become people to be shunned, criticised and branded as speculators, and that is a bad thing to be unless one is betting on a horse, which is also speculation. People are branded as speculators or landlords and all these words suddenly have a sharper and more pejorative meaning.</P>
      <P>In a normal market they are people who make property available for those who, for one of a variety of reasons, do not want to buy a house but want somewhere to live. I have been in that situation. I spent eight years as a tenant in two different houses, although not in this country, with two different rental agreements which protected my interest and that of the landlord perfectly well. I suppose those two landlords could have been called speculators. They would have been criticised if at the time I was renting there was the same tension in the Belgian market that we have witnessed in our market. If a few years later the bubble burst and there were many people on low incomes who could not afford to buy a house they would be glad to have such landlords to let property at reasonable rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times like this we become almost like political caricaturists. We pick a feature of the market, exaggerate its importance and say that is to blame for this problem when it is only one of many factors. This Bill is designed to deal with almost everything except the real problem which is that we have high demand for housing because we have a rising population with relatively good incomes. In recent budgets, for reasons of which we are all aware, we encouraged people to get <Col N="457" /> increases in real incomes. We have always had a culture that places a premium on private ownership and we have made it possible for people to get more into debt &ndash; I do not say afford more. We have a culture that says there is nothing wrong with being in debt. Financial institutions encourage people to get more and more into debt. One of them has weird, and supposedly humorous, advertisements stating it will give a loan and it does not matter what it is for, you can decide for yourself. That together with a great many other matters affects the housing market.</P>
    <P>What is the normal reaction of a market to a boom in demand? It is expansion of supply. No matter how you do it or what political culture or ideology you espouse, it takes a considerable time to expand the supply of land that is available for housing. It does not matter if you are a Trotskyite, left-wing pinko, right-wing blueshirt or the greenest Green, it is still difficult to expand the supply of land for housing and it takes time to build houses and apartments. There is a series of measures that need to be taken but it all comes back to supply.</P>
    <P>A suggestion that is becoming more fashionable and is part of our psychosis is that there is much land that is rezoned. Before land is rezoned it is politically acceptable across the spectrum but when it is about to the rezoned it becomes contentious. Recently we have found that people who rezone land must be evil, perverted and corrupted. There is a party in this House that held at one time that anyone who rezoned land must have an evil speculative motive and must be on the take. Yet they have supporters and are happy to have voters living in houses built on rezoned land. I remember canvassing in a town outside my constituency. A very pleasant young man opened the door to me and was going to support my party colleague. Just as I was leaving he said he was very worried about the zoning of land in the town. I asked him what the problem was and he said they were going to rezone the land behind where he was living and he did not like that because he had bought a house on the edge of the countryside. Being in the middle of an election campaign I decided to temper reality with a little political nous and I did not say what I thought of saying. What I should logically have said was if five years ago the people who lived a hundred yards away took the same view as he did he would not be living there now. Everyone wants to live on the edge of the countryside and see green fields at the back of their house on the edge of a town. Everyone objects to someone else coming into that position. That it will happen is inevitable. Any area in which I have lived or know of has had more housing built.</P>
    <P>Our planning system requires us to go through a process of development plans, designating land and applying for planning permission. We have suddenly discovered a new breed of animal who is to be shunned, hanged, drawn and quartered. They are people who &ldquo;hoard&rdquo; land. It is populist to say that part of the housing market problem is <Col N="458" /> that people are hoarding land. There is land that is rezoned and serviced but people are sitting on it waiting to make huge profits. I have heard it all and if I wanted to I could make a speech that would be replicated in this House in which there would be umpteen references to the small man and the ordinary PAYE taxpayer and so on. It would be great gas but it would not add anything to the sum total of human wisdom and, more importantly, it would not add anything to our housing supply. When you rezone land and get permission to build on it you must get the resources together to construct even when it is serviced. We should devote our resources to sorting out that part of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has amended the section that deals with special development zones to make them suitable for housing and I am delighted to see that. I hope I am right about it. He said he would do this on Committee Stage. That will be a far more important instrument in expanding housing supply than anything in Part V. The Minister will take it as a sincere and not at all gratuitous compliment when I say I am delighted he took up the suggestion I made on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not have anything against housing strategies as proposed in the Bill but we will need a better context for them than a series of county development plans. I am still waiting, agog, but more in hope than expectation, to see a Government statement on spatial strategy. I received a document on it the other day. It is the latest stage in the long and tortuous consultation that is taking place on this. I would like to see the spatial strategy, the special development zone measures and the local authorities' housing strategies put in place. We would then have the framework on which to build an active housing policy.</P>
    <P> People say local authorities should be able to do this, that and the other, for example, acquire land compulsorily. They can do that already. They can acquire land and make it available to people who want to build their own houses by direct labour. They can acquire land and make it available at less than the normal market price to people who can build houses or have them built. They are doing it in voluntary housing schemes. It is not that this is not possible. The problem is we do not have sufficient direction in either Government or individual housing authority policies to put them together in an energetic way that would meet the problem. There is land available for building. Money is available to service land. Local authorities can be funded to enable them build houses and make land available for low cost affordable housing but we are not doing that. An important part of the Minister's efforts involves trying to get local authorities to accept the need for higher housing densities. In towns all over the country local authorities are waiting to buy substantial tracts of land to build eight or ten houses to the acre when they should be building at much higher densities near the towns using well designed apartment blocks. This would help take <Col N="459" /> some of the steam out of the housing market but it is not being done. So long as we continue to go off on tangents, as is the case with much of this Bill, we will miss some of the measures which could make an important short-term contribution to deal with the housing problem.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a series of amendments which deal with different aspects of the problem. I do not like the method proposed by the Minister but I am a realist and know that something like that will be legislated for. I am trying to remove the worst parts of that approach. It will be contentious to levy land on developers but it will be even more contentious to levy land on them and pay them for that land at a notional price which the Minister calls &ldquo;present use value&rdquo;. However, it is nothing like the present use value for zoned land.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 190 and related amendments propose that, if we are to levy land on developers, we should do so at the zoning stage and not at the planning application stage. That would be far less contentious and would have the same effect in the future as the measure proposed by the Minister. In addition, it will not leave the system open to so many potential challenges. I do not know whether the constitutionality of the provision will be challenged. I would not encourage anyone to do so but some may mount a challenge. Even if the constitutionality of this contentious proposal is not challenged there is much scope in the argument and arbitration about prices to make it a slower rather than a faster mechanism for getting land into use for housing.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 193 seeks to rewrite the central section of this Part of the Bill. The amendment seeks to remove those parts of the Minister's proposal which are tangential and excessively intrusive and which will cause the greatest arguments about the price and value of land and so on. Amendments Nos. 196 to 198, inclusive, set out to encourage the provision of mixed housing, which the Minister is trying to bring about. The amendments seek to get away from the ghettoisation and separatism we see in so much housing development and which will continue as they are what most people in the private housing market want. I say so as a matter of fact and not because I approve of them. Such an approach would lead to much healthier developments such as can be seen in many European cities where there is a mix of developments that work together quite happily. However, every major European city has the kind of social segregation in housing that can be seen in Ireland. Such a situation is universally bad and we should do as much as we can to get away from it.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some doubt so I am also proposing that we make it a specific provision in law that local authorities can require someone who makes an application to build dwellings to include a mixture of dwelling types aimed at different segments of the market. A Dublin planning authority tried to impose such a condition <Col N="460" /> but it was appealed. An Bord Pleanála refused to make it a condition because it did not know what it meant. I am setting out to provide in law that such a condition can be legitimately required in a way which is understandable and usable by housing and planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála as a means of judging whether a development is in keeping with the proper planning and development of an area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes has proposed a measure to provide for a certificate of reasonable value. I will not go into that issue as the Deputy will deal with it himself. I have tried to round the edges of the more controversial and unworkable parts of the Minister's proposals. I would like to see us return to the reality of what can and should be done in the housing market. I will not use the dreadful phrase, &ldquo;There is no quick fix&rdquo;. In one of yesterday's newspapers a prominent media person wrote that no decent speech should ever use the phrase. That is from the Carr school of communications so I will follow the advice and not use the phrase &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo;. However, there is no slow fix either but a series of measures which respond to what the market is producing. It will not be achieved by hysteria or artificial measures such as those proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If these measures are in operation in four or five years, we will conclude that the market sorted itself out far better than the measures we put in place. That is far from a recipe for doing nothing, but is a recipe for doing the things we know can have an effect on the market.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal, for example, will not increase the amount of land available but may reduce the amount of land as people will be in less of a hurry to get land zoned for housing. The Bill rightly provides for a system under which the zoning of land lasts only as long as a development plan. If land has not been developed by the end of that plan we start again with a new assessment of what the land should be used for. That is right and in keeping with the needs of a development. By the time we come to the end of the next development plans which will last for six years, we will look back and conclude that all the fire and thunder in 1999 and 2000 about the Minister's proposal to levy land on people was just eye wash.</P>
    <P>People should look at what is happening in reality. Without the Minister's measure a number of developers are already offering to sell land to local authorities at very advantageous prices compared to the rest of the market. They are doing so to ensure they get permission for particular kinds of developments. They know that local authorities need land for social and affordable housing. They are not prepared to make a gift, as that is not the business in which they operate, but they are prepared to make land available to local authorities at very reasonable prices. These developers are anticipating and are intelligently taking control of an idea which is out of control in the Minister's mind and has turned into the land levy principle included in the Bill. In five or <Col N="461" /> six years we will find this will have been a far more constructive response than that proposed in this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the general purpose of Part V of the Bill which seeks to make 20% of residential development land available for social and affordable housing. The Labour Party was the first party to call for the introduction of such a measure. I am pleased the Government has responded to it. My criticism of the measure before us is that in the Bill, as presented, the 20% land provision will not become available for a long time. Therefore, its impact on housing will be delayed for at least three or four years. I spoke at considerable length about that on Committee Stage and outlined the various stages that must be gone through, which I do not think are necessary. Effectively, that means it will be three years at least before there is house construction activity on land provided for under this mechanism. That is why I tabled amendment No. 180. It would make the 20% provision a condition of planning applications made from a current date rather than making it a condition attached to the making of a housing strategy and the inclusion of such housing strategy in a development plan and that only then a planning application could be made on it.</P>
      <P>If the 20% provision is to have an effect on the housing crisis, it needs to be introduced immediately.  The Minister argued on Committee Stage that to take that approach would pose a constitutional risk. He argued it would be necessary to put in place the housing strategy first to have a basis for the 20% land being made available. I suggested then and repeat now that there are a number of ways by which that can be dealt with. It can be dealt with by having a national housing strategy. Less than an hour ago the Government asked us to welcome its national housing strategy, whatever it is or wherever it will be implemented. If there is a national housing strategy, it ought to be capable of overcoming that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There cannot be any great difficulty in justifying in the interests of the common good and of social justice the making available of 20% of land, which under the Bill as drafted is the maximum amount of land that can be made available for social and affordable housing &ndash; given the number of people who are unable to provide housing from their resources. When my party first made these proposals two years ago, the 20% provision at that time was probably a reasonable enough stab at what would be required under a measure of this kind to make land available for social and affordable housing, but given the way house prices have continued to increase and the additional number of people who have been frozen out of the house purchase market, the 20% provision is not sufficient. That is why I tabled a further amendment, which proposes to <Col N="462" /> lift that 20% cap on the amount of land that can be made available under this formula.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, states that the maximum amount of land that can be zoned for social housing under a development plan is 20%. I suggested that should be a minimum rather than a maximum figure, given the level of our housing need.</P>
    <P>I also suggested that we need to amend the definition of persons who will be eligible for affordable housing. The provision included in the Bill is that it would be people whose housing payments would exceed 35% of their net annual income. A problem with the existing range of housing measures, social housing schemes and public housing schemes are the various income limits that apply. They create housing traps for people who are trying to access them. A net annual income limit of £12,000 applies to the voluntary housing sector and another eligibility limit applies to people seeking to get on to the council housing waiting lists. There is another formula for the shared ownership scheme. We will have a formula for the affordable housing scheme, and they are all different. What is happening in practice is that because those formulae are related to income, as a person's income or circumstances change, he or she can be eligible or ineligible for such schemes.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a number of people who have been waiting ten years for local authority housing. They applied for houses in 1990 and in 1994 or whenever their incomes exceeded the limit and they were taken off the waiting list and remained off it for two or three years and when the income limit changed they got back on to the waiting list and may have to come off it at a future date.</P>
    <P>I know of a young working mother who attempted to access the shared ownership scheme but was ineligible to participate in it because under formula that was then used she was £1,000 or thereabouts over the income limit that applied to the scheme. She could have afforded to buy a house at that time under that scheme. The formula changed and she was eligible to participate in the scheme, but by the time it changed the prices of houses had increased and she could not access it.</P>
    <P>It would be preferable if income limits were not applied to such measures. If people are in a position to buy a private house, they will do so or if they want to rent privately, they will do so. If they want to apply to participate in the shared ownership scheme or the affordable housing scheme, they will do so. The income side can be dealt with by adjusting the repayments to meet it. I tabled an amendment to deal with that aspect.</P>
    <P>A matter that needs to be taken into account in this area is the 20% formula. One of my criticisms of it is it is a stand-alone measure. It needs to be accompanied by mechanisms to control the price of houses. The Irish Home Builders Associ<Col N="463" /> ation has threatened that if this measure is put through, it will increase the price of houses on the remaining 80% of the development land by as much as 25%. If that happens, the only way to deal with it is to attach a control mechanism to this measure.</P>
    <P>I am aware that what I am saying does not find favour with Deputy Dukes. Although we have tended to find common cause throughout the rest of the Bill, we part company in our approach to this issue. I listened carefully to his contribution regarding the housing market on which I must make a number of points. It is not a question of those of us who are critics of the operation of the housing market at present finding caricatures or scapegoats or seeing the big bad wolf in the form of speculators, the reality is that there is speculation in building land, which is taking a number of forms. There are those who are buying agricultural land for which they pay £20,000, £30,000 or more per acre around cities and towns where they perceive development potential. That is speculation. It is driving up the price of land and is fueling a demand for that land to be rezoned not on the basis of what might be good planning but that the person who bought the land wants a return on it. That is not good for the housing market or for the way in which one plans for development.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;if the market comes to understand that development land and housing development land is in the main in the control or under the charge of a public authority, the element of speculation disappears. If land can be accessed by a builder at a reasonable price from a local authority the builder will not have to try to get it at a much higher price from a private developer. It is not that people are hoarding land in a sly way. What is happening is normal in the marketplace. There are hoarders of land, this is particularly the case in Dublin, who are holding on to their best sites in the anticipation, in the event of a downturn in the housing market, that those sites will always be capable of development. That is hoarding. There are owners of land who&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but that does not justify it. It may be the normal behaviour that one can expect. Where that is happening and if it miti<Col N="464" /> gates against the common good there is an obligation on the Government to intervene in the interests of the common good. The Deputy mentioned that people buy second and third houses. People who have money to spare look at the ways in which to invest it and some invest it in second, third, fourth and whatever number of houses they can afford. They see it as a good investment, and there is a good return on that investment now, and they perceive a degree of capital appreciation on it. Some invest in properties in Spain, Portugal, Florida and so on, and good luck to them. The problem is&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a time when we were smothered in tax breaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, and the reason that was done was not in the interests of tenants, house buyers or whatever but to stimulate activity in the building industry, but no stimulants are required now. The problem is it is not a choice. One cannot say people are choosing to rent or to buy. That is an over-simplification of it. It reminds me a little of an esteemed former colleague, who has departed and for whom we all had a great deal of affection, who used to argue that people in the mid-1980s chose to emigrate when it was patently clear they emigrated because they could not find work here. Most persons who rent residential property do so because they cannot afford to buy it. In many cases the rents they pay for residential property are in excess of what they would pay in mortgage repayments for the purchase of the same property. There is something fundamentally wrong with that. Of the 46,000 houses built last year, which was a record housing output, a huge number were bought by people investing in them and letting them. The effect of that activity was that it was bidding up the price of the house on the potential buyer and then forcing the potential buyer to rent the property from the successful bidder, often at rents that are higher than the property could be bought for in the first place. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes used the word &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; a number of times, this idea of the loyalty of Irish people to the concept of private ownership and private property. One of the things which has made Irish people loyal to the idea of private property is the ability to buy their own home. That is the fundamental item of private property that most people in the State own. What is happening at the moment is that the ability to buy one's own home is being denied to large numbers of people. In the long-term this may have an interesting impact on the loyalty to the concept of private property.</P>

      <P>The right to buy their own homes <Col N="465" /> has been a view that has been adhered to by people across the political spectrum. The only difference is that the operation of the housing market is denying people the right and the ability to buy their own home. Measures will have to be taken to correct that and to enable people to buy their own home. That is called intervention in the market. I know it is an idea that is alien to some colleagues&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but it has to be done. On the issue of land, it is clear that if one looks at social housing programmes there is a critical shortage of land in a number of local authorities which is preventing them from fulfilling their public housing programmes. The second problem is the site cost. The cost of building land is one of the major contributors to the rise in house prices. The Department's housing statistics show that the cost of building materials and labour has increased during the past five years in line with inflation or with average earnings. What has shot way off beam is the price of houses. The biggest element in that gap is the increasing cost and price of building land. This is one measure which will help that. My regret is that the way in which it is being done by the Minister is long-fingered and it needs to be accelerated.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that Deputy Higgins wishes to get in &ndash; I know he supports everything I have said. The point is that two sets of amendments are being considered here. Deputy Dukes's amendments are designed, as I see it, to pull away from the 20% formula while my amendments are designed to accelerate the operation of the 20% formula and to add to it.</P>

      <P>What we are opposed to is the inappropriate zoning of land or the zoning of land driven not by the interests of good planning or the public good but exclusively by the interests of the landowner. That is entirely different. As Deputy Dukes said earlier, there may be people living happily in houses on land zoned some years ago. Whether the areas and communities in which they live have been properly planned is another day's work. The approach of my party to the reviews of development plans and the zoning of land would have provided for much better planning of those communities than&mdash;</P>

        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> If it comes down to it and it is all we are left with at the end of the night, I will support the 20% requirement of land to be devoted to social and affordable housing as the Government is proposing. However, it is a pathetically inadequate measure to deal with the extent of the housing crisis. It is lame of the Government to propose this measure when for the three years of its tenure it has allowed a crisis to develop apace to such an extent that ordinary people are suffering the most appalling hardship the length and breadth of this country, particularly in the main urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments in the name of Deputy Gilmore are closest to my thinking. However, I am constantly fascinated by the one word thrown out against me in every assembly, whether it is in the county council or this House, by spokespeople for the Government and the Fine Gael Party who say the &ldquo;market&rdquo; is the cause of the housing crisis, as if it was some kind of a disembodied deity removed from and outside the terrestrial zone we occupy and over which we have no control. In the interest of clarification regarding these amendments, we need to understand what the market is. The market is simply this &ndash; ordinary people need homes. It is one of the basic needs and we <Col N="467" /> have landowners, developers and house builders who can provide those homes. The meeting of those two categories of people constitutes the market.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, according to the laws of this land, supported by successive Governments, the latter group is given the upper hand in regard to whose interests come first. Therefore, we have the greedy minority who see a need in society and take the opportunity to profiteer outrageously. We have a Government which continually stands aside and allows them to do this which has created this major crisis. Land speculators, a tiny cabal, are allowed <i>carte blanche</i> and put at risk the lives and quality of life of tens and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people. Those moving into the new housing market to purchase houses to let them out as landlords form another category of speculator whose tenure has not been challenged. They have also been allowed a free rein by the Government. As a result we have rackrenting landlords whose activities would rival those of their landed counterparts in the 19th century, whom Michael Davitt took on in such exemplary fashion.</P>
    <P>The problem is that we have a small cabal who hold the people to ransom. The Government, backed by Fine Gael, instead of being prepared to take these people on, bow down and pay homage to the god of the market, based on their conservative, capitalist dogma. That is the reality. Much of the basis of the housing policy of the Minister, the Government and Fianna Fáil is taken from conservative thinking. If one looks at the signatories of 1916, the thinking of the Government is dominated by the conservative element. Take the principles of James Connolly for a change, who would excoriate the profiteers and this Government for standing aside and allowing this cabal to create this crisis for working-class and young people.</P>
    <P>We need to remove building land from the hands of the speculators. Unfortunately, this Bill and the Minister's provision does not do this to any significant degree. The speculators should be screwed to the wall. There should be at least an 80% windfall tax on the massive profits they are making. Instead of the 20% proposed by the Minister, there should be a land bank around every city, town and provincial centre, to be regulated by local authorities at agricultural prices and then let out as needed for development, whether it is housing or commercial. Every time this proposal is raised in the Dáil, the Taoiseach, presumably supported by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, quotes the Constitution. Judge Kenny, a High Court judge, did not think in the early 1970s that the Constitution was a problem in countering speculation. If his recommendations had been taken on board the situation would <Col N="468" /> have been resolved long ago. Even if there is a constitutional problem, let us challenge the Government &ndash; go to the people. They will overwhelmingly support measures that will provide land at affordable prices so people can have homes at affordable prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes referred to zoning and was having a go at the Labour Party and the Socialist Party because we opposed many speculative rezonings in Dublin County Council. How right we were to do that has been borne out by recent events. However, when one is in a county council and one is presented with zoning proposals, one cannot divorce one's mind from the fact that by raising one's hand in favour of residential zoning, one is playing into the hands of those who speculate outrageously. It will drive the price of that land up 50% or even 100%. That is what is wrong with zoning, it is not that land should not be set aside for various uses or that proper planning should not take place. We fought to protect the greenbelt because it is critical to have greenbelts between built up areas. However, we want to take the speculation out of zoning.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate the Government did not take one simple measure that could have had a major impact, particularly in Dublin, on the question of housing availability, including private rented housing. Every third level college should have purpose built accommodation for all its students. That method alone, which would be quite simple to administer, would mean that thousands of houses and private rented units would be freed up. That would have been of huge assistance.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing lists are in a terrible crisis. Public representatives, such as myself, have to deal with the suffering that causes on a weekly basis. We need major involvement there. The local authorities should not be dependent on construction companies. In many cases, they have difficulties in getting their tenders sent back and so on, which delays construction. We should return to direct labour by local authorities, with local authority construction companies and units, or even a semi-State construction company which could respond flexibly and quickly to the crisis, by building the homes and apartments needed for public housing, rather than being dependent on speculators. That is a socialist approach, rather than the free market, free booting approach adopted by the Government and supported by Fine Gael.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 208, which I tabled originally on Committee Stage, deals with the issue of the introduction of a certificate of reasonable value. I was one of the first people to propose, in principle, the concept of setting aside land at reasonable levels for the purposes of affordable housing schemes. I said that, unapologetically, over 18 months ago. I support that prin<Col N="469" /> ciple today as much as I did then. However, we have to introduce a system which actually works. I do not believe the proposals set out in Part V will work.</P>
      <P>First, I was told by the local authority in my area the other day that it will be at least one year before the housing strategy will be in place. We will not be able to put in place this provision until that period of time. The housing crisis will grow in that time. Nothing will be done in, at least, the next one to two years about this proposal.</P>
      <P>Second, as everyone will concede, having read the contents of Part V, there is no measure in the Minister's plan that will ensure that where the land has been set aside, the original price will be kept for the people who will buy houses in the ordinary course of events on the remaining 80% of this newly zoned land. There are no mechanisms in the Bill to ensure that 80% will not have to pay for the other 20%. As I predicted on Committee Stage, the 20% of land that is set aside will come out of the pockets of the people who purchase houses on the remaining 80% of the land in the ordinary course of events. There is no mechanism in Part V to deal with that, which is why I proposed in amendment No. 208 the introduction of a certificate of reasonable value. That would ensure the cost of sites and house building is kept to a minimum and that there is a fair profit in property transactions. That is all we are looking for.</P>
      <P>The Minister said on Committee Stage that I would be embarrassed when I heard the reply to that amendment. I am not embarrassed at all and I am still not convinced by his proposals. I do not believe they will work. Deputy Dukes said earlier this could face a constitutional challenge. The right or wrong position on that challenge will be irrelevant, because what we need to see is houses being built as soon as possible. We do not want to be in a situation in 24 months' time where the fascinating debate we are having on Part V is not implemented. I do not believe mechanisms are in place to ensure the cost is borne by the landowner and not by the people who will buy houses on the remaining 80% of the land in those new residential areas.</P>
      <P>There will be a huge amount of disenchantment among large numbers of young couples who will be buying houses in these new housing estates, subsidising the affordable housing schemes on the other 20% of the land, as a result of the inefficiency of this Bill. That is why the Bill is deficient. The Minister should look again at the implementation of his principle, which I believe to be right. We need a compensating mechanism to ensure it is implemented, but no such mechanism is in place in Part V.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to provoke Deputies at this stage. The discussion on the amendments before us has been very wide-ranging. I thank all the Deputies who are now claiming credit for the idea of the provision of 20% of land for social and affordable housing. It is nice to know that, despite the criticisms of some aspects of it, at least there is general consensus in the House that it is a step in the right direction. I emphasise it is only one element of a whole range of programmes and items the Government has put in place over the past two or three years to try to ensure the ready supply of housing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes correctly made the point at the outset that there is a distortion in the market. There was not a sufficient supply to meet the demand, which was the main focus of the first Bacon report which we initiated within weeks of coming into office. Supply factors and the existence of speculators were identified as the major items. Deputy Dukes seems to think that everybody uses the term &ldquo;speculator&rdquo; pejoratively. There were speculators and I cannot help that people have got it into their minds that that is a pejorative term. Large numbers of houses were being bought by people for rental and investment purposes. The first Bacon report indicated those were the two major problems. The high demand for housing was analysed as having been caused by the increase in the younger population. It was a wealthier population because people were earning more. In addition, tax reductions meant there was more money in people's pockets &ndash; the result of a policy pursued by the Government &ndash; and the interest rate levels had created a certain distortion in the market. As a result, demand exceeded supply.</P>
      <P>At the time, the Government set about rectifying the problem on the basis of the recommendations and analysis then available. Contrary to the comments made by Deputy Higgins, the Government took a fair amount of flak from the speculators, construction industry, landlords and so forth. However, we had identified the problems and decided to tackle them. We also indicated at that time that we would continue to keep the housing market under review and adjust the measures as necessary. We did that again following the second Bacon report. Tomorrow the third Bacon report will be made available and the Government will have a response to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes will describe it as interfering in the market and I agree. We will take a number of measures that will affect the market with the sole aim of trying to ensure that as many people as possible who want to get on the first rung of <Col N="471" /> the ladder of home ownership will be able to do so. That is the sole focus of Government policy since it started tackling house prices when it took office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes mentioned that builders are now selling land to local authorities at favourable prices and are becoming more engaged with local authorities. That is true, particularly in Deputy Higgins's constituency in Fingal. They are agreeing with the local authorities about the provision of affordable housing even though the requirement is not yet law. I accept that point. However, if we had not embarked on the course of action provided for in this Bill and had not taken such action, I doubt that the builders would be talking to anybody about providing social and affordable housing in their developments.</P>
    <P>I gave clear signals to the construction industry during my first year in office that I wanted its members to come forward with suggestions and solutions for the supply of affordable housing, given the way house prices were increasing. I did this publicly in venues where builders congregated, such as the CIF annual conference. The opening of an auctioneer's premises was another venue and there were many more. I met the Construction Industry Federation and the IHBA and made it clear that the Government's priority was the provision of the maximum amount of affordable housing for young people coming into the market.</P>
    <P>After approximately 18 months, the IHBA came forward with a suggestion that it would con<Col N="472" /> tribute approximately £6 million per year to a scheme it had put forward which would cost the taxpayer almost £94 million. That was unacceptable and that is why we have taken the route in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for acknowledging and welcoming the fact that the strategic development zones will be used for housing. I appeal to all Deputies to try to make this legislation work at local authority level. Deputy Gilmore accused me earlier of trying to shift the blame. I am not doing that but stating facts. At local authority level, some people continually say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and block area action plans, local area plans and so forth while at the same time crying about the price of houses and what is happening in the housing market. When this procedure comes into place, which I hope will be quickly, I urge Deputies to ensure that it is supported at local authority level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter in the context of the announcement this week by the Government of the mainstreaming of certain services for people with disabilities and the responsibility FÁS will have for the employment and vocational training of people with disabilities. As the House is aware, the NSSB has been replaced by Comhairle, and a number of different services for people with disabilities are being transferred to various Departments.</P>
      <P>More importantly, I raise this issue in the context of the very high level of unemployment among people with disabilities, estimated to be as high as 80%, which is appalling in the context of the labour shortages and the fact that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is recruiting people in other countries. I have deliberately addressed the motion to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment rather than to the Departments of Health and Children or Justice, Equality and Law Reform because I raise the matter in the context of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is aware that the provision of personal assistants has been the responsibility of various bodies and has proved very unsatisfactory in the past. In some cases health boards are paying <Col N="475" /> personal assistants while in other cases they come under CE or jobs initiative schemes. In all cases there is no long-term security for people with a disability or for people working as personal assistants, which is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>This week a number of Deputies from different parties met OASIS, a cross-Border group of people with disabilities. They very strongly made the point that the criteria for access to the CE and jobs initiative schemes are very narrow &ndash; it is necessary to be long-term unemployed, in a certain age category, etc. &ndash; so that those who would like to become personal assistants through the scheme and who would be good at the job cannot qualify, while those doing the job well have to come off the schemes after a certain period. People with disabilities are looking for a permanent, properly structured and organised solution in terms of providing personal assistants.</P>
    <P>A personal assistant can make an enormous difference to the life of a person with a disability. This week every Member of the House received an e-mail from a man who raised the crisis in the provision of personal assistants. He said that because he has a PA he is in full-time employment, was able to purchase his own house and can bring his children out for social occasions and pick them up from school, etc. These are the enormous differences that the provision of a personal assistant can make to the life of a person with a disability. The gentleman also made the point that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get personal assistants because of the wages they are paid under the current schemes. He also pointed out the impractical situation of personal assistants having to travel across the city to his home as they live nowhere near his area.</P>
    <P>We need a permanent solution to the problem. The Centres for Independent Living made a pre-budget submission which gave an estimate of £12.6 million for a proper scheme. This is a very small price to pay for the civil rights of people with disabilities and to allow them participate fully in society on a social, employment and educational level. Having a personal assistant makes the difference in terms of being able to participate.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a crisis in transport for people with disabilities. Solving the problem was difficult because the issue fell between various Departments. Vantastic was the organisation in Dublin which campaigned at that time, but it is a problem throughout the country. The same problem arises regarding personal assistants, the provision of which falls between various Departments. Therefore, I call on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take on the issue, to provide the necessary funding and to treat it as a jobs issue. It is an employment issue both in terms of personal assistants and the right of those with disabilities to take up employment. <Col N="476" /> The Disability Federation of Ireland suggested the social economy fund could provide funding to establish the scheme on a proper basis.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to end the uncertainty surrounding the issue of personal assistants and to establish the system on a proper structured basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. The Tánaiste has asked me to reply on her behalf. The primary purpose of the community employment scheme as an active labour market programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. CE provides unemployed people with temporary opportunities whereby they can develop their skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience.</P>
      <P>CE was restructured during 1999 to take account of the tightening labour market and to refocus the programme on older persons and those most removed from the labour market. The restructuring also improved the position of women with regard to access to the programme by giving qualified adults, that is, adult dependants of long-term unemployed persons, and widows and widowers access in their own right.</P>
      <P>The target average participation on CE this year is 35,520 and there is provision for up to 2,875 places on the jobs initiative programme. These programmes are being provided at a budgeted cost of £316 million in 2000. The Government has also provided £10 million for the new social economy programme which is expected to be up and running shortly. This programme has provision for 670 full-time places in the current year.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, issues regarding the mainstreaming of essential services currently provided by community employment participants, including services for the disabled, will be considered by the PPF standing committee on the labour market, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The committee is comprised of representatives from relevant organisations and Departments, including the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs, CORI, the INOU, the ICTU, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the IBEC and FÁS. Other organisations and agencies as may also have an interest in the work of the committee will also be invited to participate.</P>
      <P>A CE audit of essential services undertaken in November 1999 identified 1,822 CE participants engaged in providing services for disabled persons. These services are classified as a priority by FÁS and have been protected from the reductions which have been imposed on other categories of projects such as the environment and education sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste is aware that the short-term nat<Col N="477" /> ure of CE participation, three years being the maximum term, is not compatible with the needs of disabled persons who need a constant companion and helper and as little disruption in their lives as possible. She has asked her Department to consider all options in regard to the personal assistance service provided under the community employment scheme to ensure disabled persons dependent on carers are not adversely affected by the restructuring of the programme. To this end the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is pursuing the possible mainstreaming of these services with the Department of Health and Children which has primary responsibility for funding in this area.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to discuss the modalities of mainstreaming CE essential services directly with relevant Departments initially before reporting to the standing committee on issues arising from these discussions. Consultations with the Department of Education and Science with regard to the mainstreaming of CE school services are already under way in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for a range of measures to improve the participation of people with disabilities in open labour market employment. Disincentives will be identified and addressed. FÁS now has responsibility for the training and progression to employment of the disabled and is committed to achieving a more integrated, mainstream approach than has been achieved to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue, which is causing extreme concern. Essentially, this is the thin edge of the wedge. Under pressure, the Government has not been willing to defend its examinations system and put in place a system which will have the confidence of students and parents alike. The Minister has decided instead to downgrade the correcting of examination scripts by engaging third level students who do not possess the necessary sensitivity or experience of dealing with subjects. Everyone knows that it takes years to gain the experience and skills necessary to evaluate examination scripts fairly. One cannot adequately coach an undergraduate or post-graduate student to do this in a few hours. In adopting this approach we will effectively have correction by numbers in the same way as we used to have painting by numbers. It will be very basic and will undermine the possibility of students indicating that they have grasped a subject fully and receiving proper credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing that in trying to defend it the Minister has suggested that it is all right to adopt this approach as it will only apply to civic, social and political education, a subject that is badly needed. Public confidence in the civic, social and <Col N="478" /> political systems is at an all-time low. Students should be properly familiar with such important and crucial issues as the political system dealing with the problem of refugees. It is, therefore, irresponsible for the Minister to suggest that this is a doss subject which can be corrected in any way he chooses. He is setting back the education system and the careful work done by teachers and the curriculum board in putting this subject together to ensure students receive a grounding in a wider range of subjects.</P>
    <P>I worry that home economics will be next to be followed gradually by others. It should not be forgotten that one in five students will only sit the junior certificate examination. It is their passport to advancement. For the Minister to downgrade the correction of that examination in this way is a slap in the face for them. I almost find it incomprehensible that in the face of demands to change the structure of the examination so that it is based on project and teamwork throughout the school year rather than memory retention in order to broaden the opportunity to learn &ndash; many of those who comment on the education system have been crying out for this &ndash; the Department has insisted on the terminal examination approach, but when it comes to the acid test it is not willing to provide the necessary resources to ensure it is corrected fairly and properly by those who possess the required experience and competence.</P>
    <P>This is a very disappointing day for the education system. It is a pity the Minister is not present to account for his stewardship. It seems that he is happy to talk about the matter on radio but is not willing to come into the House to defend the indefensible. I have no doubt that the Minister of State, who is in an unenviable position, will read a supplied script about invigilation procedures and the various checks and balances but the reality is that if one does not have experienced teachers &ndash; the Minister of State is an experienced teacher &ndash; one will not have the breadth of testing and examining required. This is particularly true in subjects such as civic, social and political education in which one is required to draw on one's experiences and on what one has picked up from newspapers. This cannot be reduced, as the Minister suggested, to simple options such as, &ldquo;Who is the President of Ireland? Is it Mary McAleese or Bertie Ahern?&rdquo;  The Minister is trivialising an important issue.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise the issue. I hope the Minister of State will give us the benefit of her experience in delivering the supplied script.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It is important to make it clear at a time when students are undertaking their examinations that leaving certificate examination scripts will be marked this year by fully qualified exam<Col N="479" /> iners appointed on precisely the same basis as in all previous years. The Minister for Education and Science finds it regrettable that at a time when students are taking their examinations any public representative should seek to create needless anxiety among students and their parents through misinformation.</P>
      <P>The only change this year is in the case of the junior certificate examination. This has involved the creation of a panel of potential examiners drawn from the third level sector, graduate and undergraduate, to cater for any shortage of examiners at junior certificate level. The number of potential examiners is under the greatest pressure in the case of civic, social and political education and, to a lesser extent, home economics. CSPE is a new and additional subject which replaced the former civics. It is an extremely important subject which is compulsory for the first time this year for more than 60,000 students. This increased the number of examiners required to almost 200. We do not have a cohort of experienced correctors as this is the first time it is being corrected for such a large number of students. In addition, the number of teachers making themselves available to examine junior certificate home economics has been a problem since the introduction of a practical component in that subject&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject has been taught for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which is examined by more than 300 teachers in April each year, most of whom are reluctant to undertake further work in late June and July.</P>
      <P>The essential point is that examiners at all levels attend intensive marking conferences prior to commencing their work. Continuous monitoring takes place during the marking process. All persons selected to examine must demonstrate in the first scripts marked by them a capacity to mark fully in accordance with the marking scheme for the subject, otherwise they are replaced. Monitoring continues on all examiners right through the process. The quality of the marking process is demonstrated by the fact that this is one of the few countries in the world prepared to allow students to scrutinise their own marked scripts and have access to the marking scheme used.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science also wants to state that the Department had extensive discussions during the year with both teacher unions in relation to the fee rates paid to examiners. The Minister increased rates for examining by 11% on average. Examiners of junior certificate CSPE, for example, can expect to earn over £1,200 on average. It remains the case, however, that many teachers are simply not interested in examining during their holiday period or have a preference to act as examination superintendents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> Overall, the marking process for the written papers in the junior and leaving certificate examinations involves more than 3,500 examiners. Practical, project and oral examinations involve 3,000 examiner appointments. The reality is that up to one in three second level teachers are involved in some aspect of examining. A further 5,500 teachers are involved in the supervision of the examinations, including the supervision of special needs students in individual centres and hospitals. This means that over 60% of the teaching profession is involved in examination work, mostly during vacation periods.</P>
    <P>Our heavy reliance on external examinations, whether written, oral, practical or project, inevitably means that there is a pressure on the supply of examiners because of the huge numbers required. To protect against shortfall, the Department of Education and Science conducted a second advertising campaign in the national press and in all second level schools. The Minister believes it is prudent for the Department to take the additional step of canvassing the third level sector to provide a reserve panel for any shortfall that might still occur. Students deserve the reassurance that their papers will be corrected in the proper manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this issue this evening on the Adjournment. There has been a trend in recent years by large commercial interests using sophisticated marketing techniques to target schools, children and parents. They do this mainly to promote their own interests to enable people buy products in their shops or to buy their product. I raised this issue in March 1998 and in February 1999. At the time the Minister said that exploitation of schools and their pupils and parents by companies with commercial motives cannot be condoned under any circumstances. I agree with that.</P>
      <P>A number of official circulars and directives making this point have been issued by the Department of Education and Science, in 1984, 1987 and 1991. At the time the Minister maintained that schools were adequately guided by these circulars and decided that no action on his part was needed. That may be the case, but are schools adequately protected from the sophisticated marketing advertising directed at parents and children? The Minister of State recently commented on this.</P>
      <P>I understand that school authorities are now asking for assistance. Primary school managers have asked for help and have described the promotions as exploitation of school children &ndash; I understand a letter has been written to the Minister to that effect. What is he going to do about this? Will he endorse these promotions by staying silent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Schools can get equipment. I have no problem with businesses being involved with and sponsoring education, but I have a major difficulty with strings attached promotions, that is, the provision of tokens and vouchers that must be used to secure the computers and other equipment on offer. If large commercial firms want to bestow their largesse on schools and the education system, let them do so, but there should be no strings attached. They can provide the computers and other products to the schools. However, in doing that they would lose out on their main focus, which is a sophisticated marketing sales plan.</P>
    <P>Schools are becoming commercial battlegrounds. Two years ago one major organisation was involved in this kind of activity. Today there are six and the number is growing. In other countries such activities are banned by law and there are specific safeguards aimed at protecting children from sophisticated marketing techniques, such as we see here.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the Department and the Minister take action before the next school year begins, including issuing guidelines and the provision of assistance to schools and teachers. I hope the Minister of State will make a positive response to this very important and growing concern.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with these companies assisting schools. They say their real motive is to assist them and provide them with equipment etc. However, I do not like the strings attached. There is exploitation here and it is the duty of the Minster to intervene and lay down clear and decisive markers. The managers of the schools are asking for help. I ask the Minister to respond and to prevent schools being used as a commercial battleground. The companies involved are trying to develop in parents and schoolchildren ways of purchasing, which they will repeat in later life.</P>
    <P>Large organisations are involved in this, to the detriment of the smaller corner shop, which cannot compete at that level. Two years ago one large commercial entity sold £150 million worth of products through the schools. What they gave to the schools in return was minuscule. This is over the top. I ask the Minister of State to intervene, to depart from her script and tell the House her own idea of what is involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this issue, which he raised with the Minister for Education and Science. It is on his behalf that I am here to answer the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a cop-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important issue and one which is becoming more frequent. That is all the more reason I wish to clarify the existing policy of the Department of Education and Science on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implicit in the issue raised by the Deputy is the <Col N="482" /> exploitation of schools, their pupils and parents by companies in pursuit of opportunities to expand market share. I assure the Deputy that the use of educationally linked promotional activity with such solely commercial motives cannot be condoned under any circumstances. The Department of Education and Science is careful not to endorse any such promotions.</P>
    <P>In the commercial world private companies are free to promote their businesses in accordance with accepted marketing practices, such as the provision of vouchers, which can be redeemed for a variety of purposes. There are also accepted marketing standards, such as compliance with advertising regulations, which guide, inform and control the relationship between the vendor and potential customers.</P>
    <P>I recognise the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotional initiatives, linking schools, pupils and parents to commercial activity. However, it would be inappropriate to prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives, provided such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of requiring additional expenditure and that children are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects serving national educational initiatives.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has said, official circulars were issued by the Department in 1984, 1987 and 1991 to the management authorities and principals of primary and second level schools concerning the promotion and marketing of commercial products through schools. The circulars noted the Minister's concern at the pressure on schools from time to time to become involved in the marketing and promotion of commercial products. These circulars impress on school authorities the need to consider carefully the implication of allowing situations to develop which would result in parents being put under undue pressure to purchase particular commercial products. The co-operation of school authorities is requested in taking steps to eliminate any undesirable practices in this regard and in formulating agreed school policies in relation to commercial promotions.</P>
    <P>I accept what Deputy Stanton says about schools feeling they are coming under increased pressure because of the increased number of promotions, especially in the past 12 months. While due vigilance already exists, the Minister for Education and Science is very conscious of this and of the request of the school managers. He has asked his officials to meet the Catholic Primary School Managers Association to discuss any concerns which that body may have in relation to school based promotions. If, as a result of these discussions the schools feel they are a battleground for commercial activity and if there is a need to reinforce the existing guidelines, I assure <Col N="483" /> Deputy Stanton that the Department of Education and Science will arrange this.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> David Richardson lies seriously ill in St. James's Hospital since an appalling and brutal attack on him in Pearse Street in Dublin on Sunday, 11 June. He was attacked because he was part of a mixed race family group, including his spouse and son, who are black people. Being visitors to Dublin they were walking to their accommodation, where David Richardson's son, Christian, lives and works. After crude racial taunts and abuse Mr. Richardson was repeatedly stabbed.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of people on this island, on Pearse Street and in Dublin are appalled at this attack. I understand from St. James's Hospital tonight that Mr. Richardson is breathing on his own again. His prognosis is, therefore, much better and we wish him a full recovery.</P>
      <P>However, we must see where lies responsibility for this. Primarily it lies with the incredibly brutal people who carried out this attack, but we must look elsewhere also. The Richardsons were visitors to this island. They are British citizens; they are not seeking asylum, but I believe that because many asylum seekers are not white and have been denigrated consistently in sections of the media and elsewhere in recent years, this has created a climate which allows certain twisted minds to believe that attacks like this are legitimate. The bigoted attack by certain politicians on people seeking refuge here, which demonises coloured people who are among the asylum seekers, can be justification in twisted minds, for barbarism against people of different ethnic origin. The policy of fingerprinting asylum seekers, which the Government proposes, puts people in a category of criminals and, in twisted minds, brands coloured people as isolated and somehow different. The prohibition on incitement to hatred legislation should be used to hammer any individual, politician or media outlet which fosters any racial denigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Definitive action to foster multi-culturalism and racial and ethnic harmony must be undertaken immediately with sufficient funds and investment from the Government. There should be investment in infrastructure to provide proper accommodation, health services, etc., for all our people in order that people of different ethnic origins are not seen to be in contention for those resources, and there should be investment in schools and the education system so that there is also an abundance of what is needed for people of all cultures and ethnic groups. This would be a <Col N="484" /> huge assistance in cutting out the perfidious poison of racism which the vast majority of our people oppose, which was responsible for this appalling attack.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing his time with me on this important adjournment debate. As a Deputy for Dublin South-East, I express my horror and outrage, and offer my sympathy to the Richardson family for their appalling experience on the streets of Dublin. I hope Mr. Richardson makes good progress from this appalling attack, and recovers.</P>
      <P>This is the latest in a series of unprovoked attacks on the streets of Dublin. When I asked the Minister about this in the Dáil some weeks ago, he told me there had been 27 reported attacks on young men in the Dublin area. What we are seeing now is racist attacks. I agree entirely with what Deputy Higgins said, that this is a sad and most unfortunate development.</P>
      <P>I hope everybody in this House shares the view that we must do everything we can to interrupt the climate of racism in behaviour and attitudes which we are seeing developing in Ireland. It is extremely important that the Government would put whatever resources it can into tackling this issue, that the fund, of which the Minister has spoken, would become available as soon as possible to start a strong public information and awareness campaign, and that everything will be done to show leadership in this area to ensure that this sort of incident will not happen again on the streets of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Since I raised this issue in the Dáil some weeks ago, I have heard many stories, as the Minister will be aware, from parents of young people who have been violently and savagely attacked on the streets. It is extremely important that there is a package of measures which will begin to address this.</P>
      <P>We must take the matter seriously, and I would encourage people to report these attacks to the Garda in order that it gets a full picture of what is happening. A package of measures, including serious action by the Garda, additional surveillance and patrolling, is needed and if this is to be tackled properly, the issue of public transport must be addressed too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I too express my horror and revulsion, and that of the Government, at the savage and senseless attack on Mr. Richardson. I know that all right thinking members of the community were appalled and shocked by this attack as he was leaving the city centre with his family after a social evening in the nation's capital. Our thoughts are with the Richardson family at this very difficult time for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard attacks of this nature with the utmost seriousness. The Garda Commissioner and the force share my concern and have indicated to me that the Garda is resolute in its determination to bring the perpetrator or the perpetrators of this <Col N="485" /> appalling crime to justice with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, and I have made this clear to the Garda authorities, neither I nor the Government will be found wanting in providing resources &ndash; should these be required &ndash; to investigate crimes of this nature.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities advise me that a person is now before the courts in respect of charges relating to this attack. In the meantime, the Garda investigation is continuing. Clearly, in the circumstances, it is not possible for me to comment further at this stage on this incident as the matter is now <i>sub judice</i>.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that any comments which could be seized upon in another forum and which by virtue of having been made here could lead to an outcome which none of us wish should be avoided at all costs. I would also ask that those outside this House when making comment on this matter be equally mindful of the requirements of due process and natural justice.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of racism, the House will know that I have taken and will continue to take steps to ensure that the evils of racism are not allowed to take root in the State. That there have already been racist attacks here is something which everybody in this House and all right thinking people must condemn without equivocation. I am aware that these attacks have led to concerns in asylum and refugee communities and among overseas students and immigrants generally for their personal safety and that of their friends and relatives.</P>
    <P>Several initiatives have been taken by the Garda authorities. Each Garda district officer within the Dublin Metropolitan Region has been appointed as district liaison officer to liaise with persons subjected to racist attacks and harassment. Each superintendent is available to meet any person who has been subjected to a racist attack, or who has concerns in this area. District and divisional officers ensure that there is a systematic monitoring of such incidents. There is close liaison between the Garda and groups representing immigrants and asylum seekers. Divisional and district officers avail of every opportunity to ensure personnel under their control are sensitive to the concerns of minority race communities in Dublin and elsewhere in the State.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are determined to learn from the experience of other countries in policing a changing society. They have hosted two international police conferences on the subject. The training currently provided to student and probationer Garda is being reviewed in the light of these conferences. Currently, all student and probationer Garda receive instruction in the area of race relations as part of their two-year education and training programme.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an inter-cultural office in Garda community relations section is another important development which demonstrates the commitment of the Garda to preparing itself for dealing with this important issue. It will be clear <Col N="486" /> to the House that the Garda Siochána is fully aware of the problems and has been at the forefront of developing comprehensive and effective initiatives in this regard.</P>
    <P>Stamping out racism is a wider issue than one which my Department and the Garda Siochána alone can address, and there is a need to foster an attitude of tolerance and an understanding of ethnic and cultural diversity.</P>
    <P>For my part, two years ago I established the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. This committee is a partnership of NGOs, State agencies, social partners and representatives of Departments. I then established an interdepartmental working group in December 1998 to formulate a strategy for implementing the Government's policy of responding positively to the needs of persons granted refugee status or leave to remain. The group recently finalised its report, which has been accepted by Government as the framework for integration policy in Ireland. Work is already progressing on the proposals put forward in the report.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed on the need for initiatives to combat racist attacks through informing public opinion and promoting a more tolerant inclusive society. It has approved proposals for an evaluation of the strategy and resources needed to plan, implement and review the development of such initiatives. The National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism is currently carrying out the evaluation, which will be completed shortly. I have already ear-marked significant funding for the State's first major campaign to prevent and combat racism, and to promote better understanding of those in our communities who appear to be different.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, last November I launched the &ldquo;True Colours&rdquo; initiative, a two-week programme aimed at making Irish society more inclusive of ethnic minorities. The programme, which was co-ordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, aimed to stimulate a more considered debate on what strategies are needed to respond more effectively to the needs of minority ethnic groups. Over 65 events took place at national, regional and local levels at which community groups, schools and other organisations were encouraged to participate.</P>
    <P>With regard to unprovoked assaults in general, I assure the House that no effort will be spared in bringing the perpetrators to justice. The Garda authorities have responded to such attacks with increased high visibility patrolling in areas with identified problems and areas where large numbers of young people congregate. In addition, all members of the Garda Síochána have been instructed to utilise their powers under public order legislation to full effect when dealing with such incidents. Crime prevention advice on this matter is also given to young males through the schools programme, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> I assure the House that the Government does not underestimate the threat posed to our society by racism. Racism is unworthy of our country and our people. It is a violation of our most basic democratic values. I will continue to use every possible means to protect ethnic minorities and <Col N="488" /> the general public from this threat. I want the House to join with me in sending out this message loud and clear to the very small minority in our midst who seek to besmirch all our names with their unacceptable and barbarous behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.12 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 June 2000.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey): On 23 May 2000 the Government agreed to accept in principle the findings of the emergency towing vessel study, which are: that an emergency towing vessel should be deployed to allow Ireland to proactively protect its coastal and marine resource and processes from the consequences of major oil pollution and vessel strandings; that the marine safety information services should be extended to incorporate the functions of a vessel traffic management information service as a means of monitoring vessel movements around the coast, and that in consultation with the International Maritime Organisation, the coasts of Donegal, Mayo and Galway be designated as marine environmental high risk areas and that passing vessels be required to maintain a specified minimum distance from the coast.</P>
    <P>The Government also agreed that my Department will, in consultation with the Departments of Finance, Defence and the Environment and Local Government assess and identify the most cost effective means by which Ireland would acquire an emergency towing vessel capacity; propose, in the light of the above, other uses, if any, to which an ETV capacity might be applied; make proposals regarding the positioning of the ETV capacity, and propose the specification, costing, ownership, manning, operation and management, financing, etc. of such an ETV capacity, and report to me before end October 2000. This consultative group will begin its study on these terms of reference at an early date and I await their recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the development of our maritime sector is high<Col N="490" /> lighted in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, as reviewed in November 1999.</P>
      <P>The programme gives unique recognition to the strategic importance of our shipping industry and commits to establishing a national maritime college, together with an Irish maritime development office.</P>
      <P>The commitment to set up the Irish maritime development office was delivered with the necessary legislation enacted last December. For the first time in the State's history the shipping industry and the onshore shipping services sector has its own dedicated development office within the Marine Institute. The office's advisory group, which has representatives of the shipping and shipping services sector and independent legal, banking and financial expertise, has been at work since December. A director for the office will be appointed later this month.</P>
      <P>The Government's purpose in setting up the Irish maritime development office is not just to encourage the growth of the Irish merchant fleet, but also to facilitate the growth in Ireland of a wide range of shipping related services: ship financing, agency, insurance, chartering, brokerage and maritime legal services. This growth will be achieved through the development of existing Irish services and the attraction of such services from abroad and an overhaul of the legislative framework governing merchant shipping.</P>
      <P>Consultants, Cap Gemini Ernst and Young, have also been engaged by the IMDO to recommend a package of incentives that will establish Ireland as a highly competitive location for shipping and related financial, legal, insurance and management services.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I am continuing to press the case for incentives and fiscal measures beyond those already in place in terms of corporation tax, income tax allowances for seafarers and PRSI refunds to their employers. I will also look at the possibilities for modifying the existing reliefs to make them both more attractive and more effective and my Department is closely monitoring the tonnage tax situation and especially developments on that front in the UK. This is also being factored in to ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>A video and brochure were launched in November 1999 to encourage our young people to take up careers at sea and pursue professional educational and training courses in the maritime area. Copies of the video were placed with every career guidance teacher and are available to interested students.</P>
      <P>In May the Government formally approved the establishment of the promised national maritime college costing some £30 million. The new college will be a state-of-the-art centre of excellence for maritime training, capable of meeting Ireland's seafarer training needs into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In establishing the college the Government is ensuring that third level education in the maritime disciplines in Ireland will be second to none <Col N="491" /> and will be available to those of our young people who wish to pursue maritime careers. The college is to be built on a ten acre site at Ringaskiddy provided by the Department of Defence. It will service all the needs of the Merchant Marine and Naval Service in a unique collaborative venture between the service and the Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Having considered funding options for the college the Government has decided that construction should be undertaken as a public-private partnership and this is now being progressed by the Departments of Education and Science, Finance and my Department.</P>
    <P>With the developments which I have outlined, our shipping sector will be well positioned for the future and we can look to it to capture real opportunities and generate new and sustainable jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect Enterprise Oil and its partners to be in a position to decide on the commerciality of the Corrib Field in December of this year.</P>
      <P>The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of wells, market availability and price and the cost of the development. The size of the gas accumulation is being assessed at present.</P>
      <P>Further appraisal drilling, aimed at trimming up on reservoir volumes, is currently being undertaken. If the results are such that the company can establish that the field is commercial then Enterprise Oil will apply to me forthwith for a petroleum lease with a view to its development. Should the field be declared commercial, my understanding from the company is that it would be their intention to have the field in production by early 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All data and information relating to the field are submitted on an ongoing basis by the company to my Department. This data is analysed by my Department using in-house expertise in conjunction with consultants. The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with this assessment is commercially sensitive and, therefore, must remain confidential. However, I should point out that Enterprise Oil is reported as saying that the Corrib Field might have in place recoverable reserves of more that one trillion cubic feet of gas. This compares to over 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas produced to date from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields. However, as I have already stated it is too early at this stage to give a precise <Col N="492" /> figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensee will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Amendment Act, 1999 provides that of the total membership of each regional fisheries board not less than four should be women.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the boards' membership is made up of a mix of elected members representing the various fisheries interests in the region and six ministerially appointed members representing other key sectoral interests together with one ministerial and one staff nominee to each board.</P>
      <P>Following the results of elections of fishery and staff representatives to the boards and the nominating process of sectoral representatives by prescribed organisations, I have completed my selection of the nominated candidates and my own nominations. Forty six members have been appointed and the three remaining appointments will be finalised shortly. In making my appointments I have taken full account of the statutory requirement to ensure, overall, a minimum balance of four women on each board.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the benefits gained from his decision to close off sections of the Irish sea from cod and shellfish fishing; and if he will review, in any such future closures, the need for prawn fishermen to be compensated for the effect this cod conservation measure has on them.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of scientific advice which indicated that cod stocks in the Irish Sea were in danger of total collapse and following detailed consultations with Ireland, other relevant member states and fishermen, the Commission introduced closed areas in the northern Irish Sea for a ten week period from mid-February. This measure was necessary to protect spawning cod. A small area of prawn grounds was affected during the period of the closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have previously advised the House, we successfully argued against the Commission's pro<Col N="493" /> posals to close a much larger area. This was primarily to ensure that as much as possible of the prawn grounds were kept open to Irish fishermen and was supported by our own scientific analysis. BIM and the Marine Institute are carrying out exploratory trials on new prawn fishing gear which would enable prawn fishing to be carried out without negative impact on the cod stock. If the trials are successful the need to restrict prawn fishing in order to protect the cod stock can be reviewed.</P>
    <P>A scientific report for the EU on the current state of the cod stock is being finalised. It is, however, too early to quantify the impact of this year's action on the state of the spawning stock. In the light of the consultations and analysis earlier this year, the Commission is also proposing new technical conservation measures to reduce the outtake of juvenile cod in the Irish Sea. It will take a number of years and continued action before Irish Sea cod stocks fully recover. Proposals for closures in the Irish Sea for 2001 will be the subject of comprehensive consultations both nationally and at European level. I strongly encourage east coast fishermen to keep in close touch with their organisations and with the Department in the months ahead. The involvement and input of Irish fishermen into these negotiations is critical.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea conservation measures are vital to ensure a viable future for cod stocks and for east coast fishermen. The closures this year were of short duration and limited impact in terms of fishing activity overall. As I have previously advised the House, I do not consider that there is a case for compensation. In the negotiations ahead we will continue to ensure that the urgent task of rebuilding cod stocks takes into account as far as possible the needs of all fishermen.</P>

      <P>I met Minister Faber, the Dutch Fisheries Minister in Galway on 18 May. This was an introductory meeting and was a useful first opportunity to exchange views on fisheries matters of bilateral concern as well as EU developments. We reviewed a range of pelagic fisheries issues in particular, where the Netherlands and Ireland have similar interests in many respects. Other issues discussed included the Commission's mid-term review of the current multi-annual guidance programme for fishing fleets, the negotiations on the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework for the blue whiting fisheries in the north east Atlantic and the need for initiatives on fisheries conservation and control and the reduction of discards in European pelagic fisheries. We also discussed our shared interest in ensuring international fishing opportunities for the EU pelagic fleet, increased competition from <Col N="494" /> Norway and the growing pelagic fisheries in developing countries. There was broad agreement on the general approach to these issues at EU level and we agreed to co-operate together on these in the interests of both our pelagic fishing industries.</P>
      <P>I underlined to Minister Faber the concerns of the Irish industry about the activities of large pelagic vessels in EU waters and my commitment to push for an observer programme on large pelagic fishing vessels. I noted that in discussion with Commissioner Fischler he had undertaken to progress examination at EU level. We agreed that our Department's should keep in touch on developments on this initiative.</P>

      <P>Under section 10 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, as amended by section 7 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, eight members are to be appointed by the Minister to each regional board. Of these eight members the Act provides that one shall be a member of the staff of the regional board nominated by the staff of the board and that six shall be appointed from candidates nominated by the prescribed organisations representing the key sectoral interests. The nomination and selection process got under way as soon as the elections of fishery interests to the boards were held and the results of the elections definitively confirmed in early April.</P>
      <P>The very detailed process of selecting the candidates from the various nominations received from the 33 prescribed organisations has now been completed. I have this week appointed the membership of all the regional boards with the exception of appointments which will be finalised over the next week.</P>
      <P>I look forward to board meetings being convened over the coming weeks.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent call from SIPTU to commission an independent assessment of the impact of oil and gas exploration on the Irish economy in view of what it regards as questionable conclusions made in the recent study prepared by the Irish Offshore Operators Association; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16677/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my replies to similar questions raised in the House on 10 February, 22 March and 10 May, the study referred to by the Deputy presents empirical data and costs about the number of exploration and appraisal wells drilled offshore Ireland since 1971, points out the employment created onshore arising from this expenditure in the past and the potential for such employment in the future. The study draws straightforward conclusions from these levels of past activity. It also puts forward a programme of action which addresses the issue of opportunities for Irish industry in the domestic and international offshore industry. I see the report as a constructive contribution to public discussion on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in previous replies, I met with a delegation from the Irish Offshore Operators Association some time ago and had a very useful discussion on how Irish industry could increase its share of goods and services supplied to the offshore exploration sector. I highlighted my expectations that Irish companies should be given full and fair opportunities to compete at all stages of <Col N="499" /> exploration and to bid for work. I also expect that every effort will be made to accommodate smaller suppliers.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned that a seminar on contract awareness for the offshore sector, organised by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Offshore Operators Association, was held on 14 April in Westport. The seminar brought together the main parties involved in the Irish offshore and enabled Irish companies in the goods and services sector to hear at first hand of the opportunities offered by the offshore sector.</P>
    <P>As I also mentioned, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to work closely with the Irish Offshore Operators Association and specific operators to ensure there is early notification of future offshore work to potential Irish participants. I am glad to say that the Irish Offshore Operators Association is committed to fully supporting these opportunities and that Enterprise Ireland has regular meetings with the industry to identify and pursue these opportunities.</P>
    <P>Given these developments, I see no reason for an independent assessment of the IOOA study or its conclusions.</P>

      <P>I have no immediate plans to provide a mechanism whereby all boat owners putting to sea have to notify the coastguard of their intended course in case of mishaps in order to assist in their location, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> However, there are a number of existing measures under which boat users are encouraged to take responsibility for their own safety at sea. The coastguard of my Department operates a traffic report arrangement under which boat users are encouraged to advise the coastguard of their plans when they are setting out to sea. This is not a mandatory arrangement, however. Also, under my Department's safety initiative, boat owners have been invited to join the yacht and boat safety scheme, whereby they provide details of their craft and equipment and this record is held by the coastguard.</P>
    <P>In addition the EC HAZMAT directive of 1993 contains reporting requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods.</P>
    <P>The report of the Irish emergency towing vessel study published in January of this year had as one of its recommendations that the marine safety information services should be extended to incorporate the functions of a vessel traffic management information service as a means of monitoring vessel movements around the Irish coast. Such a scheme would facilitate the coastguard staff by providing them with a traffic image of vessels in its area of responsibility. The recommendation of this report have been accepted in principle by Government and will be fully examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>The installation of VHF digital selective calling has been completed by the coastguard, making Ireland a global maritime distress and safety system area A1 and A2 country. The DMDSS provides for an improved reception of distress alerts and these alerts contain the identification of the vessel in distress as well as the position of the vessel. All vessels required to comply with the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, 1974, are expected to be equipped with the shipboard portion of the GMDSS.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also know that a departmental group, modelled on the principles of partnership and consisting of staff, unions and management, has commenced the assessment of the IMES expenditure review, including the recommendations concerning a coastguard, and will identify the necessary organisational and service delivery changes which might arise with a view to maintaining and enhancing the high quality provision of search and rescue and pollution response in our marine and littoral areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>To determine the status of the marine environment, Ireland prepared its own quality status report entitled Ireland's Marine and Coastal Areas and Adjacent Seas: An Environmental Assessment.</P>
      <P>The report which was published in March 1999 by the Marine Institute addressed key issues, including quality of bathing waters, human pressure on coastal ecosystems, actions which affect fish stocks and levels of contaminants. It concluded that Ireland's marine environment was in a healthy state.</P>
      <P>Section 6.34 of the report deals with radioactivity from Sellafield. It states that concentrations of radionuclides are highest in the north Irish Sea and decrease with increasing distance from Sellafield. It concludes that discharges from Sellafield, from a public health perspective, result in relatively small doses of radionuclides and, therefore, do not pose a health hazard to the Irish public through the consumption of seafood caught in the Irish Sea. It also reassures the Irish public with regard to enjoying the recreational amenities of the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>The report of the Task Force on the Dumping of Radioactive Material in the Maritime Area which was published in January this year reiterates this message. The key conclusion of this report is that the risk to human health and to marine life from past dumping of radioactive material is extremely low and does not constitute a health hazard.</P>
      <P>The information contained in both reports is invaluable and will provide a benchmark against which future environmental changes will be measured. We need to remain ever vigilant in the protection of our marine environment, particularly in view of the very real threat posed by the operations at Sellafield.</P>

    <P>During the five year period the total declared commercial catch has declined from 258,000 to 145,000 which is a percentage decrease of some 44%. Over the same period the total catch of salmon by all fishing engines, including rod and line, declined from 314,000 in 1995 to 180,000 in 1999 which is a percentage decrease of some 43%.</P>

      <P>The sustainable development of the Irish fishing industry depends, among other matters, on the development of alternative methods of fishing and of diversification of fishing effort towards non-quota species.</P>
      <P>Under the programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet, strong emphasis is put on developing non-quota opportunities including black scabbard, blue ling and grenadiers. Vessels availing of grant aid and tax incentives under the programme must include in their catch projections a minimum of 30% non quota species. In line with trends elsewhere, it is envisaged that the larger new whitefish vessels under the programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet will actively participate in developing national track record in the non quota deepwater species.</P>
      <P>I have also provided funding for BIM to carry out fishing trials on deepwater non-quota species such as greenland halibut, black scabbard, blue ling, orange roughy and grenadiers. During 2000 BIM is carrying out a deepwater fisheries programme with eight vessels participating including five new vessels brought into the fleet under the renewal of the whitefish fleet. The trials to date show that successful commercialisation of deepwater non-quota species is achievable. These trials are set to continue this year and in 2001 targeting a variety of fishing grounds and non-quota species.</P>

The central and regional fisheries boards and all fisheries interests will also be working with farming and other interests to develop catchment management.</P>

      <P>The EU proposals to which the <Col N="506" /> Deputy refers are views contained within the European Commission mid-term report on the current multi-annual guidance programme, MAGP IV. These views do not as yet have the status of formal proposals and the commission will have to submit a formal proposal for Council decision if it intends to proceed. Any such proposal would fall to be considered during the French presidency, in the second half of the year and a prolonged and difficult debate could be expected.</P>
      <P>The Commission's views, if implemented, would imply significant reductions of the order of 10% for the Irish fleet. It is not possible at this early stage to quantify the potential impact of such proposals for the processing sector. Along with other EU ministerial colleagues, I will be taking serious issue with the underlying assumptions and analysis of the Commission's report at the Fisheries Council later this week.</P>

      <P>The 2002 review of the Common Fisheries Policy is an opportunity to deliver much needed reform and overhaul to reflect the radically changing context in which the CFP must operate. Since the last review in 1992, there have been fundamental global changes in markets, fisheries management regimes and in technology which in my view need to be reflected in the CFP.</P>
      <P>I have personally stressed this view to Commissioner Fischler and I have also briefed him on the work being undertaken by the national CFP Strategy Review Group. The interim reports prepared by the group have been presented to the Commission and when the overall report is submitted to me, I will also present it to the Commission. In this way I intend that the Commission will be fully aware of the analysis of the CFP group as part of our strategy to influence the debate at an early stage.</P>
      <P>The Commission is currently undertaking a comprehensive analysis which will result in the publication of its own report at the beginning of next year. That report will be an important element of the review process and I look forward to considering it in consultation with my EU Council counterparts.</P>

    <P>The general scheme of the Bill follows the principal recommendations of an interdepartmental working group established to examine this critical safety issue. In essence the Bill will provide for the putting in place of a legislative framework to allow for the establishment of an independent adventure activities standards authority; mandatory registration of adventure centres and providers with the authority for specified activities; mandatory codes of safe operating practice for specified adventure activities; implementation of a regulatory scheme, involving inspection of centres and providers for adherence to safety <Col N="508" /> codes; and powers for the authority to order cessation of the provision of any or all adventure activities in the case of failure to observe safety codes.</P>

      <P>The north west pelagic industry initiative, which I launched in Killybegs on 12 May, is an industry forum under the chairmanship of Mr. Padraic White for the pelagic catching and processing industries in the north west. I have mandated the group to develop short and medium term industry led strategies to maximise returns for fishermen and processors from the pelagic resources available to the industry. This initiative is a vital opportunity for the pelagic sector to agree itself on strategies for co-operation and partnership between catches and processors which will enhance the economic returns for all concerned. I have asked the group to focus in particular on the development of co-ordinated or joint approaches to improved quality control, fisheries management, sales and marketing.</P>
      <P>The Government's £20 million Killybegs harbour development programme will critically back up new strategies to deliver an integrated pelagic catching and processing centre at Killybegs. In the context of increasing international competition and working with available pelagic resources the challenge for this industry group is to focus on value rather than volume and to deliver a shared strategy for co-operation and development of the north west pelagic industry. The group is scheduled to conclude its work in October.</P>

      <P>In April 1995 the Government approved a pro<Col N="511" /> posal to investigate the feasibility of establishing a science and innovation centre at Citywest Business Park, Dublin.</P>
      <P>In the light of this decision a sum of £2.1 million, has been invested by the State in the period 1997 to 1999 through the Vote of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the Dublin Science Technology and Innovation Centre, now called Growcorp Limited. The main proportion of this expenditure relates to construction costs of the centre.</P>
      <P>The primary mission of Growcorp which commenced operations in May 1999 is to develop a world class reputation and identity as a centre of excellence for entrepreneurship in informatics and associated health sciences through the global commercialisation of client company products fostered in an environment of innovative business support systems. The Growcorp building is connected via fibre to the digital park backbone and each module within the building has state of the art communication services available to each workstation. The building was designed and has been outfitted to present a world class corporate image for client companies. The centre supports the creation of a significant number of high value added jobs in research and development, marketing and administration.</P>
      <P>Since opening in 1999, Growcorp has incubated 14 start-ups in the information and communication technologies, ICT, and life science sectors. Three of these have grown satisfactorily and are now located in their own facilities. Eleven start-ups continue to be incubated in Growcorp. A total of 144 high value added jobs have been created to date and it is expected that the projected employment of the 14 companies could reach a combined total of 280 jobs by the end of 2000. The initial companies established in Growcorp have performed well and their success has established that Growcorp has the necessary business support services facilities and expertise to enable companies to grow swiftly and successfully in a supportive environment.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that Growcorp will continue to incubate about ten companies a year. Companies are identified for incubation where the projected employment levels can average 11 high value added jobs in the first year of operation and have the potential to be major players in the global marketplace within three years.</P>
      <P>From the outset Growcorp has briefed the third level sector on its initiatives. A pilot programme was started with the Institute of Technology Tallaght to support individuals who have no prior business experience but have a novel idea for the development of a life science product or service. The first group of ten participants will complete this one-year training programme in October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growcorp is actively looking at mechanisms to expand its operations in order to facilitate an increased number of start ups. This is likely to involve the attraction of private funding and the <Col N="512" /> State is not considering any further financial commitments to the project.</P>

      <P>The main thrust of the recommendations of the task force report were that the arrangements which have been put in place in recent years as regards the ongoing marine radioactivity monitoring programme carried out by the RPII and also the ongoing research into radiological impacts by the RPII and the university sector should continue; that caution should be exercised in carrying out any works that may disturb the seabed in any area where radioactive waste has been dumped and a careful assessment of any potential risks made; and that the Government should continue its leading role at international level in the protection of the marine environment and that it should strenuously oppose any attempt to renew the practice of dumping radioactive material.</P>
      <P>As I previously advised the House on 10 February and 22 March 2000, I support all these recommendations. The attention of the UK authorities was drawn specifically to the recommendation in paragraph 4.14 of the report on the need to exercise caution in carrying out any works that may disturb the seabed in any area where radioactive waste has been dumped.</P>

Any request made by the local authority for funding for coastal protection works will be fully considered by reference to all relevant technical engineering and other criteria, taking account also of the funding available and overall coastal protection priorities.</P>
      <P>No funding for works at Portmarnock has been sought from my Department by Fingal County Council to date.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my statutory six monthly report to the Oireachtas for the period to 31 December 1999, as of 31 December 1999 there were three extant State mining licences, 12 extant State mining leases, and 463 extant prospecting licences; and in the period of six months ended 31 December 1999 there were 53 prospecting licences were granted, 42 prospecting licences were surrendered, andtotal receipts from leases, permissions and licences for mining and exploration amounted to £623,575.73.</P>
      <P>The combined output from the zinc-lead mines at Tara, Galmoy and Lisheen brought Ireland to eighth largest in the world as a producer of zinc in concentrates. When Lisheen reaches full production we expect to be in sixth place. The opencast gypsum mine at Knocknacran, County Monaghan, continues to provide the raw material for plaster and board manufacture at nearby Kingscourt and to supply all cement manufacturers on the island.</P>
      <P>In spite of a world wide downturn in investment in minerals exploration, Ireland has not only maintained the level of expenditure by explorationists but increased it to in excess of £10 million in 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply of 10 May last to similar questions, a plan of development for the south-west lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field was approved last year and the field was brought into production in October. I also mentioned that there are important developments taking place in relation to two other hydrocarbon accumulations in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to the Corrib field is that the licensees are currently drilling a third appraisal well and when that is completed they intend to drill a further appraisal well. They hope to be in a position to decide whether the gas find is commercial or not in December next. The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of wells, market availability and price and the cost of development of the field.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Oil is reported as saying that the field might contain more than one trillion cubic feet of gas-in-place. However, it is too early at this stage to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery.</P>
      <P>Should the results of their appraisal programme show that the gas can be commercially produced it will be necessary for the licensees to apply to me for a petroleum lease and submit a plan of development for the field for my approval.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Helvick oil field, a number of estimates of recoverable oil and gas has been made. However, it is now understood from the company involved that the estimates of oil-in-place is in the range of 18 million to 28 million barrells.</P>
      <P>The Helvick oil field is held under a petroleum lease by Providence Resources who have declared the field commercial. A detailed plan of development for the field was due to be submitted to me for approval by the end of April this year. Following recent discussions between officials of my Department and the licensees, submission of the plan of development has now been deferred until later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> There has been no exploration or mining for non-petroleum minerals under the minerals development Acts in the Irish offshore in recent years nor has my Department any application at present for such activities.</P>

      <P>The EU proposals to which the Deputy refers are views contained within the European Commission mid-term report on the current multi-annual guidance programme, MAGP IV. These views do not as yet have the status of formal proposals and the commission will have to submit a formal proposal for council decision if it intends to proceed. Any such proposal would fall to be considered during the French Presidency, in the second half of the year and a prolonged and difficult debate could be expected.</P>
      <P>The commission's views, if implemented, would imply significant reductions of the order of 10% for the Irish fleet. It is not possible at this early stage to quantify the potential impact of such proposals for the processing sector. Along with other EU ministerial colleagues I will be taking serious issue with the underlying assumptions and analysis of the Commission's report at the Fisheries Council later this week.</P>

      <P>In the case of structural softwood, self-sufficiency levels have improved significantly since 1980. In 1980 the level of self-sufficiency was 20% and has increased to 50% currently. The level of self-sufficiency could exceed 70% by 2015 if Irish softwood can attract higher value, new end-users currently serviced by imported spruce and pine.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, for the foreseeable future the outlook for broadleaves is not encouraging. The current supply of hardwoods is mainly used in the crafts or small niche areas such as hurley and furniture manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, since the mid 1990s broadleaf planting has increased to over 20% of overall planting and, while taking account of the long production <Col N="518" /> cycle for hardwoods, a steady supply of native hardwoods will come on stream in the second half of the present century.</P>

      <P>Due to the various thresholds and reliefs in capital acquisitions tax, it is difficult to estimate the gross underlying assets being transferred by way of inheritance or gift. The probate tax base would give a more representative picture of assets transferred on death because of the lower thresholds and reliefs. It is tentatively estimated that the present amount of net taxable assets in the probate tax base is about £1.3 billion. Statistics are not available which would enable an estimate of the gross value of the assets chargeable to probate prior to the netting off of reliefs and exemptions to be compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the current estimated outturn of capital gains tax in 2000, it is estimated that the corresponding amount of net gains, that is, after subtraction of the appropriate reductions and reliefs, is approximately £2.2 billion. This includes gains on the disposal of assets by individuals as well as the gains arising on the disposal of development land by companies, which are not distinguishable in the overall figures. Statistics are not available which would enable <Col N="522" /> an estimate of the value of those gains prior to the netting off of deductions and reliefs to be compiled.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that information on the extent of exempt activities, goods and services is not readily available and could only be compiled at a disproportionate cost. If a previously exempt activity becomes subject to VAT, offsetting credits in respect of relevant vatable inputs would have to be allowed to a registered trader and to any VAT registered customer. Therefore, the VAT yield to the Exchequer would be net of all such input credits.</P>

    <P>If, however, the existing 22% band of £17,000 single, and £28,000 married were to apply in addition to the 10% bands described above, the cost would be substantially higher, up to £783 million. It should be pointed out that, unlike other tax regimes where an introductory rate of 10% applies, there are substantial income tax exemption limits in the Irish tax system which effectively remove many low income earners from the tax net, thereby reducing the necessity for, and the impact of, a low rate starter tax band.</P>

      <P>I am further informed that the amount of tax paid by the taxpayer in each of the tax years 1996-97 to 1998-99 inclusive is correct &ndash; the inspector has not yet received details of the taxpayer's income for the 1999-00 tax year. The taxpayer has benefited from increased tax-free allowances and reduced tax rates each year. However, it is noted that the P35 returns submitted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development show that the gross amount of the taxpayer's pension income has decreased slightly each year since 1996-97 and this may account for the position as outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The decision to subject products containing St. John's Wort, hypericum perforatum, to prescription-only status was taken following a recommendation from the Irish Medicines Board which is the competent authority in this country for the assessment and licensing of medicinal products. The safety concerns identified by the Irish Medicines Board included effects of the product itself such as hypersensitivity to sunlight together with potential interactions with other medications &ndash; cylosporin, the contraceptive pill, warfarin, digoxin and theophylline. In addition, the board was concerned that St. John's Wort was being widely advertised for the treatment of depression and openly sold in many outlets for this purpose. The board considered that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self-diagnosis and self-medication were inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the making of the regulations which confined St. John's Wort to prescription-only control with effect from 1 January 2000, a number of other national regulatory authorities have also issued warnings in regard to these products, including the Food and Drugs Administration in the United States, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency of the European Union and, as the Deputy is aware, the Medicines Control Agency in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In view of the foregoing, and in the interests of protecting public health, I have no plans to alter the current regulatory position concerning products containing St. John's Wort.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the fear being expressed by the medical profession that hospitals and or hospital services will close at the end of 2000 due to the lack of junior doctors; if he will encourage the extension of the time temporary registered non-EU doctors can stay here from five years to seven years as a part solution to the problem; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the situation nationally has now worsened and the numbers of hospitals which will be affected is far greater than anticipated; and if he will confirm that this is not part of an agenda to close smaller hospital units.</Quest>

      <P>Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid for a number of weeks to come as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Hospitals are exploring all options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that, as far as possible, present services will be maintained. I am confident that with full co-operation from all concerned, and a degree of imagination in making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised. I would like to assure the Deputy that there is no intention to close smaller hospitals because of any perceived shortage of junior hospital doctors.</P>

The pack consisted of 15 different items and included the board's presentation to the above meeting, documents relating to St. John's Wort and the general issues surrounding the safety of herbal medicines, the board's recently published &ldquo;Guide to the Definition of a Medicinal Product&rdquo;, and also the article to which the Deputy refers. I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board that it considered the article in question as simply another view in relation to the general issues surrounding the safety of herbal medicines, published in a reputable non technical journal.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>A key characteristic of the intercountry adoption service is its demand-led nature. The inability of service providers to respond to the enormous increase in demand was one of the reasons which led to the review of the intercountry adoption assessment service in the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo;. While patterns are undoubtedly linked to the decreasing availability of Irish children for domestic adoption, this alone does not explain the growth in interest in intercountry adoption of recent years. There is no doubt but that this service was considerably under-resourced in the past. However, the level of unpredictability experienced in recent years is bound to affect the ability of the individual boards to make rapid responses to such increases. For example, between 1998 and 1999 four of the boards saw an increase in applications, some almost a two-fold increase, the other four saw a decrease in numbers applying. Preliminary indications are that applications in 2000 may well exceed applications in 1999 in some of the boards.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the additional funding £1 million already allocated, £500,000 in both 1999 and 2000, following the publication of the report on intercountry adoption assessment procedures in 1999. This funding was allocated on the basis of waiting lists in December 1998 and September 1999 respectively. In other words, those boards with the largest number of people on their waiting lists received the bulk of the funding. The largest beneficiaries of the additional funding were the Eastern Regional Health Authority, formerly the Eastern Health Board, and the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional funding was used to recruit additional social work staff, improve office <Col N="528" /> accommodation, information technology and clerical and administrative support. Several training initiatives on the new assessment model have also been organised and funded on a cross-board basis. Additional guidance on the implementation of the new standardised framework has also been commissioned by my Department and will be available to social workers shortly. These initiatives are contributing to a reduction in waiting times and the duration of assessment as well as the fast-tracking of second assessments. It must be acknowledged that there are variations in progress between boards.</P>
    <P>According to data received at 31 March 2000 there were a total of 1036 applications awaiting assessment, including second time applicants. While some boards have a considerably greater number of applications than others, waiting time is obviously dependent on the numbers of social workers engaged in assessment in the individual boards. In that regard, I must point out that there have been considerably difficulties in the recruitment of social workers and this has inevitably delayed the expected impact of the additional funding in some boards. This has also been exacerbated by the adverse media attention on the intercountry adoption service in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Clearly, the availability, recruitment and retention of appropriately qualified staff will be a key element in reducing waiting times for assessments. I am satisfied that the boards are doing their utmost to recruit the necessary staff. The difficulties being experienced are part of a general shortage of social work staff in the child care area, including child protection services.</P>
    <P>An implementation group was established to plan, prioritise and cost the implementation of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo;. This group is nearly finished its work and have advised that a report on progress will be made available to me in the coming weeks. I understand that this report will contain, <i>inter alia</i>, a comprehensive outline of developments arising from the implementation of the Standardised Framework as well as findings and recommendations in relation to the future of the intercountry adoption service.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the health boards insist on people who have completed an assessment already for the adoption of one non-national child have to wait for a full waiting period again for assessment for a second child; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to one of the recommendations in the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo; that applications for second assessment should be prioritised within the boards' waiting lists. <Col N="529" /> However, the report also noted that when a couple or single applicant have an initial assessment, the recommendation is generally based on the assessment of capacity to parent one child. Therefore, there is a clear need for a second application to go through a second assessment process. In addition, it commented that good practice dictates that the first child settles prior to introducing a sibling.</P>
      <P>The waiting time for first and second assessment in each of the boards at the end of March this year are outlined in the following table. It is evident from the table that this recommendation to fast-track second assessments is already being implemented in the boards. The &ldquo;Guide for Practitioners&rdquo; which has been commissioned by my Department to provide guidance in relation to all stages of the standardised model of assessment will include a framework for second assessments which will further facilitate streamlining of these applications.</P>

      <P>The current complement of social workers on the inter-country adoption team in the Eastern Regional Health Authority is as follows: one acting senior social worker, one half-time team leader post, and eight and a half social work posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional funding provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 1999 and again in 2000 was aimed at the recruitment of increased social work staff. However, particular difficulties have been experienced regarding the recruitment of social workers in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. These difficulties refer to the recruitment of social workers for both adoption and child protection services. Despite other initiatives which the Eastern Regional Health Authority has taken to improve the service to applicants for inter-country adoption, the availability, recruitment and retention of appropriately qualified <Col N="530" /> staff will be a key element in bringing waiting times to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that four full-time staff and a senior social worker left the service in the latter part of 1999. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has advertised for social workers on a whole-time, part-time and sessional basis. An additional four and a half posts have been filled. As the Deputy will appreciate training and induction is required for new workers in inter-country adoption and the delivery of preparation courses for applicants. The inter-country adoption team also carry out post-placement visits and reports, follow-up report for the sending country. There are currently 130 cases on hand which require post-placement visits. The completion of post-placement reports, which arise from the number of children already adopted from abroad in the region, also places a demand on social work resources.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about long delays in the east and I will continue to monitor the situation closely, in particular with regard to the filling of additional social work posts.</P>

      <P>A consultant rheumatologist was appointed by the South Eastern Health Board and took up duty on 1 February 1997.

      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I have announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding is being allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer-term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way.

      <P>Irish regulations require that, subject to certain exemptions, every vehicle and every trailer attached to a vehicle should be equipped with wings or other similar devices to catch, so far as practicable, mud or water thrown up by the rotation of the wheels, unless adequate protection is afforded by the body of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>I have under consideration the incorporation in national regulations of Directive 91/226 EC which sets out the technical requirements which a spray suppression device must meet in order to obtain EU type approval.</P>

      <Quest>the exemption limit in 1988 for a single storey house extension to be built without planning permission; the way in which such an extension, built without by-law approval, can now be regularised; if any state agency arranges certificates of compliance; to whom and the way in which a householder should go about getting a duly authorised certificate.</Quest>

      <P>In accordance with the planning regulations in force in 1988, any works for the provision of an extension to the <Col N="534" /> rear of a dwelling house or the conversion for use as part of a dwelling house of any garage, store, shed or similar structure attached to the rear or to the side of the dwelling house where the height of any structural addition did not exceed that of the dwelling house and the original floor area of the dwelling house was not increased by more than 23 square metres, was considered exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.</P>
      <P>Planning law does not provide for certificates of compliance in relation to development which has been carried out. However, if it is considered that planning permission should have been required, a person may apply for retention permission from the relevant planning authority in respect of the development.</P>
      <P>In relation to by-law approval, section 22(7) of the Building Control Act, 1990, provides that where any works to which by-laws applied were carried out prior to 13 December 1989, and any requirement of the by-laws concerned or any statutory requirement relating to the by-laws was not complied with, approval to the carrying out of the works shall have been deemed to have been granted, unless the building control authority had served on the owner of the works or other person concerned within six months of that Act becoming operative a notice stating that the works constituted a danger to public health or safety.</P>

      <P>The National Association of Tenants Organisations, NATO, recently sought a meeting with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to discuss refuse collection charges. In reply, NATO was advised that EU and national policy and legislation place particular emphasis on the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle in respect of waste disposal costs. The collection of household waste, the imposition of refuse charges and appropriate exercise of statutory waiver provisions are matters for each local authority and in which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no function. In the circumstances the Minister considered that a meeting was not appropriate.</P>

    <P>As part of their normal work, the staff of my Department regularly carry out reviews and stud<Col N="536" /> ies in relation to policy issues or aspects of the administration of the Department's schemes and services. These generally do not involve additional costs.</P>
    <P>On occasion external consultants may be engaged to assist with reviews and studies. I do not have any hand, act or part in the vetting or decision making process. Details of the actual or projected costs of these commissions since I took office are shown in the following table.

      <Quest>if he will ensure that the fuel allowance will be increased significantly, particularly in view of the ongoing and major increase in fuel prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is made to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, a person must satisfy a means test. A substantial improvement in the means test was introduced by me in the 1999 budget. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings-investments of up to £22,400 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Any increase in the rate of payment would have to be considered in light of the modest increase overall in domestic fuel prices since the current rate of the fuel allowance was set, taking into account the substantial increases in primary payment rates over the same period.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. With regard to the payment rates, the group concluded that the rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, substantial increases in all social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999. Further increases of either £4 or £7 took effect at the beginning of May 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided for people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre. Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment, ENP. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 17% in the last seven years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44 million in 1999. To increase the fuel allowance by £1 per week would cost approximately £7.1 million per fuel season. To double the allowance from £5 to £10 per week would cost an extra £35.5 million per fuel season. Any change in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the state aged 66 years, or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. The spouse or partner of the passholder may accompany the passholder free of charge when travelling. While a spouse, regardless of age, does benefit from being able to accompany the passholder, he or she is not a <Col N="539" /> qualified person and has no underlying claim until he or she reaches the qualifying age.</P>
      <P>The review considered that the main objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active within the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care. The fact that a spouse can accompany the passholder is a positive aspect of the scheme, which should encourage greater mobility. The review concluded, however, that to extend the free travel scheme to spouses, regardless of age, would be outside the objectives of the scheme and discriminate against other groups such as single people, who cannot avail of the pass until reaching the qualifying age. In the circumstances, there are no plans to introduce the change sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the grant aid available from his Department to elderly people to help them install security or alarm systems in their homes; if he will outline any initiatives taken by his Department to help elderly people in rural areas feel safer in their homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 some 53,000 individuals have received assistance under the scheme at a cost of £13 million. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a further sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme grant aid is available towards the cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people, aged 65 or over, must: be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> Under the terms of the scheme a maximum of 90% of the once-off costs associated with the purchase and/or installation of this type of equipment can be funded. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with these systems are not provided for under the scheme.</P>
    <P>While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90% of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. Priority in allocating the available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
    <P>Individual people who wish to obtain assistance under the scheme, must do so by way of a voluntary organisation, such as community alert groups, neighbourhood watch groups, Muintir na Tire, etc. The involvement of such organisations in identifying and addressing the security needs of older people in the community creates opportunities for groups to develop wider links with older people in their areas. It also has the potential to increase, in a very real sense, the support network available to vulnerable older people in the community, while also allowing for a flexible response to individual needs. The energy and commitment of these voluntary groups is one of the strengths of this scheme's administration and although the scheme was established to increase the security and social support of vulnerable elderly people nationally, this approach is particularly effective in rural areas where elderly people experience greater degrees of isolation.</P>
    <P>My Department aims to ensure individuals are aware of the scheme by advertising it on a national and provincial basis and by disseminating information on the scheme through a range of voluntary organisations and through the community liaison section of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>While the closing date for receipt of applications was 26 May 2000, the regional offices of my Department are flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community. If the Deputy requires information on which voluntary groups are actively participating in the scheme in a particular area, I would be happy to provide details in this regard.</P>

      <P>The amount of lottery funds which were available to my Department in each of the last three years were: £5.6 million in <Col N="541" /> 1997; £8 million in 1998; £21 million in 1999. This funding was used to meet the cost of programmes supported by the voluntary and community services section of my Department. In addition to lottery funds the Exchequer provided £12 million in 1997 and £13 million in 1998 for those programmes. The programmes supported by those funds ranged from small, once off grants to three-year renewable funding commitments.</P>
      <P>The community development programme aims particularly at mobilising the capacity of disadvantaged communities to participate in mainstream local development, training and education, enterprise and employment opportunities, as well as having a strong focus on influencing policy and working for change at regional and national level.</P>
      <P>The family and community services resource centre programme focuses particularly on combating disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit. Centres can provide special services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support and can act as a first step to community participation and social inclusion for the most vulnerable and marginalised families.</P>
      <P>The core funded community and family support groups programme provides support for smaller scale self-help work in specific target groups which experience disadvantage-disadvantaged women and men, lone parents, travellers etc &ndash; to articulate their point of view and participate in a process of personal and community development.</P>
      <P>My Department funds a number of once-off grant schemes which concentrate on support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work. These are the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, community development education and training grants scheme, and the scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups. These schemes and programmes of support for community development focus on capacity building, so that socially excluded groups and local communities can be active participants in identifying and meeting their own development needs, working alongside the social partners.</P>
      <P>There are 50 money advice and budgeting service projects around the country. These projects provide an advice and budget management service to people in difficulty with moneylending and over indebtedness.</P>
      <P>Details of all grants made under the various schemes-programmes have been made available to the Oireachtas Library each year to 1999 for the information of Members. Details of the 2000 grants will likewise be made available early in 2001.</P>

      <P>One of the key priorities of this Government is to secure the future of our older people. Our record of unprecedented investment in social welfare measures, more than £428 million this year alone, is aimed mainly at improving the position of pensioners, people with disabilities and people on low income and attests to the firm commitment of the Government to ensuring the welfare of all our older people remains at the top of our agenda.</P>
      <P>The range of improvements which the Government has introduced for older people in this year's budget, including the £7 increase on the maximum weekly personal rate of pension, all contribute to the target set out in our action programme review to increase all social welfare old age pensions to £100 per week by 2002.</P>
      <P>The increases in the weekly payment have taken effect four weeks earlier than last year. Next year, I intend to bring forward this implementation date to coincide with the start of the tax year in early April 2001.</P>
      <P>From October 2000, there will be substantial improvements in the way capital is assessed which will benefit a significant number of old age pensioners. I have also improved the position of people who were on reduced rates of the old age contributory and retirement pensions and have extended coverage for the old age contributory pension under a special arrangement which gives further recognition to contributions paid prior to 1953.</P>
      <P>In relation to extra improvements for people aged 75 and over, I have made provision in budget 2000 for the extension of the free schemes to all people aged over 75 regardless of income and household composition. This measure will be implemented in October this year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Government has allocated £5 million for this year to my Department's scheme of community support for older people. The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and, while the closing date for receipt of applications was 26 May last, the regional offices of my Department will continue to operate a flexible approach in accepting late applications.</P>

      <Quest>the reason social insurance contributions made by a person (details supplied) in Dublin 14 prior to 1953 were not taken into account in assessing his current entitlement to contributory old age pension; if the arrears of contributory pension which accumulated in the period from his attaining the age of 66 and his making application for a pension on 11 September 1997 will be paid to him; the reason this has not occurred to date.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least ten social insurance contributions paid or credited from 1953, or from the date of entry into insurable employment, if later, up to the end of the tax year before he or she reaches age 66. Social insurance contributions paid before 1953 under the national health insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions set out above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for contributory pension in September 1997. According to the information available, he worked as an employee between 1942 and 1952. Since then he has been self-employed. He first commenced paying insurable contributions which are reckonable for pension in April 1988 when pay-related social Insurance was extended to self-employed people. His application for pension had to be disallowed as he has a yearly average of less than ten contributions.</P>
      <P>With Government approval I introduced a special half-rate contributory pension with effect from April 1999 for certain self-employed people who have a total of at least five years reckonable contributions paid since April 1988. The person concerned was awarded this pension, including a half-rate qualified adult allowance and a fuel allowance with effect from the introduction of the pension on 9 April 1999. He is getting this pension at the rate of £86.10 per week. As this pension was paid to him from the date it was introduced, no arrears of pension are outstanding.</P>
      <P>In this year's Social Welfare Bill which has since been enacted I made provision for a further a special half-rate contributory pension for certain people who entered into insurable employment before 1953. This pension is also payable at half rate from 5 May 2000 and cannot be paid in addition to another entitlement. While he satisfies the conditions for receipt of this pension, there would be no financial advantage to him in transferring to this pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to receiving old age contributory pension, the person concerned was receiving an old age non-contributory pension at a reduced rate since he first applied for the pension in September 1997. The only circumstances in which this pension could be back-dated are where the delay in making application was due to Department error, illness, a force majeure or where the claimant is <Col N="544" /> currently suffering from financial hardship. If any of these exceptional circumstances apply in the case of the person concerned, he should provide my Department with the relevant details and a decision will then be made.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to amend existing legislation so as to provide that persons entitled to old age contributory pension who apply for receipt of their pension subsequent to attaining 66 years of age, receive any arrears accumulated between the date they attain the age of 66 years and the date of making such application; and his views on the fact that to deprive any person of such entitlement is unjust and inequitable.</Quest>

      <P>People claiming social welfare payments are required to make their claim within a specified period of time. Where a claim is not made in time, payment can only be backdated for a specified period, the duration of which varies with the type of claim.</P>
      <P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits are set out in section 205 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as amended, and in regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a claim is made late, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.</P>
      <P>Under section 205, full arrears are payable on foot of late claims for the old age contributory pension, retirement pension and widow and widower's contributory pension in the case of claims which are not more than 12 months late. Under regulations I have made, additional arrears are payable on a proportional basis in the case of claims which are more than 12 months late. I have also provided that further payment may be made, up to the level of full retrospection, in the following exceptional circumstances: where the delay was due to incorrect information given by the Department; or where illness or a <i>force majeure</i> prevented a person from claiming earlier; or where the person is suffering current financial hardship.</P>
      <P>In addition, last month I placed on a statutory footing a compensation scheme for social welfare recipients, such as pensioners, for delays by the Department in determining their social welfare entitlements. Under these arrangements compensation will arise where a social welfare payment is not made within 12 months due to an error by the Department in processing the claim. This could arise, for example, where a valid claim is mistakenly disallowed or the Department has misinterpreted the law governing the appropriate entitlement to a particular payment during the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes which have been made in this area represent a comprehensive, equitable and flexible <Col N="545" /> response to the issues which have arisen. In the circumstances, there are no plans for further changes at this time.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the current estimated outturn of net capital gains tax in 2000, it is estimated that the yield to the social insurance fund would be of the order of £99 million if PRSI was applied at the main employee rate &ndash; 4.5% &ndash; on the corresponding amount of net gains, that is, after the subtraction of the appropriate reductions and reliefs. These gains include gains on the disposal of assets by individuals as well as gains arising from the disposal of development land by companies which are not distinguishable in the overall figures. As statistics are not available which would enable an estimate of the value of those gains prior to the netting off of deductions and reliefs, it is not possible to arrive at an estimate of the yield to the social insurance fund if employee PRSI was applied to gross capital gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the current estimated outturn of net capital acquisitions tax in 2000, it is estimated that the yield to the social insurance fund would be of the order of £59 million if PRSI was applied at the main employee rate &ndash; 4.5% &ndash; on the corresponding amount of net acquisitions, that is after the subtraction of the appropriate reductions and reliefs. As statistics are not avail<Col N="546" /> able which would enable an estimate of the value of these acquisitions prior to the netting off of deductions and reliefs, it is not possible to arrive at an estimate of the yield to the social insurance fund if employee PRSI was applied to gross capital acquisitions.</P>
    <P>Based on the total amount of income identified for income tax purposes as benefit in kind in 1997-8, the latest year for which statistics are available, it is estimated that the yield to the social insurance fund would be £10 million if PRSI was applied at the main employee PRSI rate. The estimated yields outlined above in relation to capital gains, capital acquisitions and benefits in kind would only be realised in the event of the present annual employee and self employed PRSI ceiling being abolished. In the absence of such a move, the actual yield from applying PRSI to these items would be significantly lower as persons with incomes above the current ceilings are more likely to be in receipt of these sources of income.</P>

      <P>The report of the Partnership 2000 working group on women's access to labour market opportunities was published on 13 April last. The group was chaired by my Department and comprised representatives from a wide range of organisations representing the social partners and from Departments and State agencies. A total of 45 recommendations were put forward in the group's report which looked at ways of increasing gender equity in access to employment, education and training programmes and improving job opportunities for women. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, all the recommendations will be progressed without delay, particularly with a view to enhancing the employability and skills of women returning to the labour force.</P>
      <P>Progress has already been made in implementing some of the recommendations. As announced in the budget, periods spent in receipt of my Department's carer's allowance will now be taken into account in satisfying the condition requiring a minimum period on the live register in order to qualify for the back to education allowance. Furthermore, since July 1999, community employment has been extended to additional categories of disadvantaged persons, including qualified adults of unemployed people as recommended in the report.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel to individual areas, that the current personnel strength of Carrick-on-Suir Garda station is 16, all ranks. There are also two official vehicles allocated to the station and local resources are augmented from within the district and division as the need arises. I am also informed that particular attention is paid by local Garda management towards ensuring that the law in relation to the sale of intoxicating liquor to minors is complied with. In that regard, the Deputy will be aware that my legislative proposals to tackle underage drinking which include severe penalties for the supply and sale of alcohol to minors are currently awaiting finalisation in the House.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that local Garda management is satisfied that the best possible Garda service is being provided in Carrick-on-Suir with the current deployment of resources. The policing situation there is, however, kept under continuing review and changes made as necessary. When additional resources next become available, the needs of Carrick-on-Suir will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of other Garda divisions-districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>There were 245 offenders on temporary release on Friday, 9 June 2000. This represented 7.5% of the total number serving a sentence on that day. As a direct consequence of the ongoing prison building programme, there has been a significant reduction in the proportion on temporary release of the total number of persons serving sentences from 19.2% in May 1997 to 7.5% in June 2000. Prisoners are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons ranging from a few hours to attend a funeral to early release which is in effect our system of parole.</P>
      <P>The number of offenders on temporary release who are under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service at present is 73. The majority of these are long-term prisoners or lifers who, over the years, would have been subject to review before being approved for temporary release under supervision. If temporary release is granted, it is always subject to conditions. In all cases temporary release is conditional on good behaviour. Other conditions generally include reporting at regular intervals to a Garda station.</P>
      <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given to a number of factors including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The overriding concern when decisions are made is the safety of the public. Every effort is made where possible to plan structured temporary releases for resocialisation purposes and to allow the reintegration of offenders into the community.</P>

      <P>While no court proceedings utilising sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 12 of the Act have yet arisen, the provisions in question have been utilised where appropriate by the gardaí during the investigation of offences. Many of the investigations at issue are, of their nature, ongoing.</P>
      <P>The number of occasions on which a period of detention was extended under section 10 was 29. Each such detention would be in respect of one person. No persons in respect of whom extension orders were made have yet been charged and convicted of an offence, but a number of files have been submitted to the law officers for directions. No persons were re-arrested under section 11 of the Act. No orders have yet been made utilising section 17 of the Act, although it is possible that the section will be invoked in relation to cases before the courts at present.</P>

      <P>Thurles Urban District Council submitted a preliminary proposal to refurbish Thurles swimming pool to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in 1994. The proposal did not proceed due to insufficient funding being available. In May 1998, responsibility for administration of the swimming pool programme transferred to my Department.</P>
      <P>Last year, my Department commissioned ILAM, (Ireland), to prepare a report on the condition of local authority pools built between 1966 and 1981. Thirty pools, including the pool in Thurles, were identified as being in need of refurbishment.</P>
      <P>Following my announcement of a £45 million funding package for the swimming pool programme 2000-2002 my Department wrote to Thurles UDC and invited them to update their proposal. The council submitted revised documentation last April and my Department is currently awaiting clarification from the council on a number of issues raised by our technical advisers during their examination of this documentation. Further consideration will be given to this proposal on receipt of the clarification sought.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the information available, it would appear that the applicant to whom the question refers would not qualify for the vocational training opportunities scheme &ndash; VTOS. The scheme is confined to adults over 21 who are in receipt of an unemployment payment or registered for credits, or in receipt of a one parent family payment or disability allowance, for at least six months. Dependent spouses in this category are also eligible.</P>
      <P>Time spent by an unemployed person on a FÁS scheme can count towards this purpose, and in that context, a continuous 26 week course would be counted as equating with six months.</P>

      <P>Following my meeting with US Secretary of Education Richard Riley on 1 June 2000 and a series of intensive discussions between Irish and US officials, we signed an historic memorandum of understanding to underpin and facilitate educational co-operation between the two administrations.</P>
      <P>The memorandum of understanding builds on existing co-operation at a variety of levels and identifies new areas for joint activities. It encompasses learners at all levels.</P>
      <P>Areas of co-operation will include special education, civic education, technology and distance learning, and disadvantage.</P>
      <P>There will be a special focus on co-operation aimed at improving literacy, vocational-technical education, adult education, post-secondary education including higher education and educational exchanges.</P>
      <P>My Department will also fund a teacher exchange initiative involving placements for ten teachers. This funding will give teachers the opportunity to work for four weeks in the United States, in innovative educational establishments, including establishments operating in the area of special needs. Provision for the involvement of two parents in this initiative is also envisaged.</P>
      <P>It is also intended to fund, on a three-year basis, a Young Leaders Programme at a cost of £65,000 per annum. This programme aims to bring Irish third level students to the United States for a two months summer internship in Government offices and private organisations. The students will participate with student colleagues from Northern Ireland in joint activities with a particular focus on helping them to become leaders in their own communities.</P>
      <P>A copy of the memorandum of understanding follows for your information.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Understanding on Education between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ireland</P>
      <P>The Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ireland, herein after referred to as the Participants;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Desiring to promote better understanding between the peoples of the United States of America and Ireland, to strengthen the relationships between the two countries through edu<Col N="555" /> cation, and to improve the education systems of each country;</P>
    <P>Believing that the expansion of mutually beneficial co-operation and exchanges facilitates the achievement of these aims, and</P>
    <P>Desiring to strengthen the links already existing between the educational communities in both countries,</P>
    <P>Have reached the following understandings:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Article 1: General Principles</P>
    <P>The Participants intend to enhance and expand co-operative efforts in education according to the following general principles:</P>

    <P>B. Such exchanges and co-operation are subject to the constitutional and applicable laws and regulations of the respective countries, and to the availability of funds. Within this framework, the Participants intend to make every effort to promote favourable conditions for the fulfilment of this co-operation and these exchanges.</P>
    <P>C. The co-operation contemplated in this Understanding is not intended to affect relations currently established between state educational agencies, institutions, or school systems of the Participants. Rather, the Participants intend to identify new areas for joint activities, or, where deemed appropriate by all concerned, to strengthen or expand existing programs.</P>
    <P>D. The Participants understand the term &ldquo;education&rdquo;, for the purposes of this Understanding, to include education for all students, including those with any type of disability, as well as rehabilitative and vocational-technical services for children, youth and adults.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Article II: Methods of Co-operation</P>
    <P>A. In carrying out the general principles of this Understanding, the Participants intend to:</P>
    <P>1. Encourage and facilitate closer relationships between state educational agencies and offices, schools and school systems, post-secondary institutions, appropriate educational organizations, and other educational entities in the two countries, with special emphasis on civic education initiatives that support cross-border and cross-community learning experiences; education for children and young people with disabilities; rehabilitation, technology and distance learning; helping disadvantaged children with a special focus on improving literacy;<i></i>vocational-technical education; adult education; post-secondary education, including in higher education; and educational exchanges, and</P>
    <P>2. Encourage mutually beneficial educational activities involving researchers, scholars, faculty members, teachers, educational administrators, and other specialists to lecture, teach, conduct research, and develop co-operative programs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> B. The Participants intend to emphasize:</P>
    <P>1. Co-operation that facilitates exchanges and dialogue centered on educational management, methods, evaluation and research particularly in the areas specified in paragraph A 1.</P>
    <P>2. In support of other bilateral initiatives and programs, the study and teaching of each other's culture and history through the development of exchanges and co-operation as described above and through other mutually decided upon measures.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Article III: Organization and Co-operation</P>
    <P>A. The executive agency for fulfilling the Understanding for the United States of America is the Department of Education, in consultation with the Department of State. The executive agency for fulfilling the Understanding for the Government of Ireland is the Department of Education and Science, in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>B. The representatives of the Participants expect to meet periodically to review the implementation of co-operation and exchanges and to develop specific programs of mutual benefit. At these meetings, which may include representatives of other interested organizations as appropriate, they also intend to exchange views on the state of educational co-operation between the two countries. The preparation for such meetings, their timing and their agendas, should be established through diplomatic channels.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Article IV: Method of Implementation</P>
    <P>A. Specific activities to be undertaken under this Understanding which have been decided upon by both executive agencies are included in the Annex and should commence during the school year 2000-2001.</P>
    <P>B. Additional annexes may provide for new activities as mutually decided by the executive agencies.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Article V: Financing</P>
    <P>Unless otherwise decided, each executive agency shall bear the costs of its participation.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Article VI: Term of Understanding</P>
    <P>Activities under this Understanding commence June 1, 2000, and continue until December 31, 2002. The understanding may be extended for successive two year periods unless one party notifies the other of the termination thereof no later than June 30, 2002, or not less than six months prior to the expiration of any such two year period.</P>

    <P>ACTIVITIES TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN 2000-2002 UNDER UNDERSTANDING ON EDUCATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND</P>
    <P>In the implementation of the understanding, the participants intend to focus on the following activities for the period June 1, 2000 through December 31, 2002. For all such activities, the participants intend to encourage, to the fullest extent possible, the participation of students, teachers, administrators, and other educational personnel from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In carrying out these activities, the Participants note that both governments have, through parallel action, dedicated financial and other resources to programs or projects that should further the purposes of the understanding.</P>
    <P>1. The Participants intend to explore ways of building on the current joint efforts of the United States and Ireland to support Civic Link, an action-learning and exchange initiative. The initiative supports cross-border and cross-community learning experiences for children in Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as other cross-border and cross-community educational activities.</P>
    <P>2. The Participants intend to explore the possibilities of co-operation, information sharing, and research relating to education of children and young people with disabilities and rehabilitation, including the establishment of a comprehensive program of co-operation relating to areas such as policy development, dyslexia, autism, inclusion, and technology.</P>
    <P>3. The Participants intend to explore collaborative efforts regarding the effective use of technology resources to improve learning in schools and other settings.</P>
    <P>4. The Participants intend to explore the possibilities of developing a joint project related to the theme of literacy in disadvantaged schools, particularly in relation to schools in high poverty areas that succeed in meeting academic achievement goals.</P>
    <P>5. The Participants intend to explore the possibilities of co-operation and joint learning in the use of television as a medium in literacy tuition or instruction (building on the experience of <Col N="558" /> Crossroads Café and the expertise of the United States in the use of popular media).</P>
    <P>6. The Participants intend to explore the possibilities of implementing an exchange of secondary school principals between the two countries during the period covered by this Annex. The Participants intend that the focus of this activity should be on personnel involved in helping schools develop policies to retain students in school.</P>
    <P>7. The Participants intend to continue to co-operate in the carrying out of a project known as the Young Leaders Program that would bring Irish students from third level colleges to the United States for summer internships in public agencies and non-governmental organizations.</P>
    <P>8. The Participants intend to explore areas for continued co-operation at all levels of post-secondary education, including matters relating to access and student mobility.</P>
    <P>9. The Participants intend to explore the possibilities of co-operation in carrying out a project in the area of arts and education.</P>
    <P>10. The Participants intend to explore joint research in rehabilitation engineering designed to advance the development of assistive technologies for students with disabilities, with a particular focus on technologies to help make successful school-to-work transitions.</P>
    <P>11. The Participants intend to continue to build support for activities growing out of the Education: The Challenges to 2020 Conference to be held on May 31, 2000, with a special emphasis on creating partnerships between education and business.</P>
    <P>The Participants may determine to carry out other activities during the period of this Annex, such determinations to be made through an exchange of letters.</P>

      <P>The enrolment as at 30 September, 1999, on which the staffing for the 2000-01 school year is based, was 264. Under the staffing schedule, this enrolment entitles the school to nine mainstream class teachers. The enrolment requirement for the retention of the 10th teacher is 270. Unfortunately, despite the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, the enrolment does not meet the requirement for a 10th teacher.</P>
      <P>However, the school has the option of examining its position in relation to developing status. The awarding of a developing school post is conditional on a school satisfying specific criteria i.e. a school which has less than 298 pupils is required to increase its enrolment by 25 pupils in one school year relative to the previous school year, and to exceed the point at which the next assistant's post is due by a minimum of five pupils. The school may contact the officials of my Department in this regard should the criteria apply.</P>
      <P>In relation to the special needs of the school, these details should be forwarded by the board of management to officials in the special education section of my Department in Athlone.</P>
