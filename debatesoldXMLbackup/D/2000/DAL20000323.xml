      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputy Yates and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31 I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to debate the urgent matter of the imminent two day and three day strikes by Dublin Bus which will inevitably impose serious difficulties for commuters, the elderly, students and city centre businesses; and the need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to set out in the Dáil a statement of the Government's understanding why the LRC talks failed, the future level of State subvention to Dublin Bus and the contingency arrangements to alleviate hardship and the introduction of bus competition.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31 I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to allow for a debate on the radical measures now needed to be implemented by the Government to reduce waste and ensure the residue is recycled, given the latest revelations that domestic and industrial waste has risen by 40% over the past three years and that local communities around the country are now, more than ever, facing a major waste crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 16, motion re Memorandum of Understanding for a Framework of Co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the State of Israel, and No. 39, Planning and Development Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>]: Second Stage (Resumed).

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated on several occasions that the proposed reform of the Transport Acts is under consideration. However, like everything else the Minister has touched regarding Dublin transport, this has been marred by procrastination. There are QBCs but no park-and-ride; there is no integrated ticketing and now the bus service will be withheld from 200,000 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a simple question &ndash; has the Government made any contact with the Taxing Master?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government shares the concern expressed by Deputy Rabbitte; the remarks were unwarranted. The Attorney General, who returned from abroad yesterday, has been in contact with the President of the High Court to express his concern. The Taxing Master is an officer of the High Court and a public servant. His remarks were clearly offensive to the Oireachtas, the judges presiding over the tribunals and previous members of the Judiciary who presided over them. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has contacted the Chief Justice to suggest that the new judicial ethics regime should cover officers other than members of the Judiciary.</P>

Is the Government serious about establishing a State claims agency and when will the legislation be introduced?

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this large and detailed Bill. The Minister has failed to secure any movement towards resolving the housing and planning crisis. This failure means that the six year national development plan will not work. The ideas put forward in the Bill, while plausible and interesting, will take so long to implement that much time will be lost.</P>
      <P>There is an extraordinary shortage of planners, architects and specialised staff. As you are aware, Sir, there are plans for three by-passes in County Monaghan but, unfortunately, because of lack of time and ability by the consultants they are still only at preparation level, with no signs of progress within the next 12 months, or even within the next few years.</P>
      <P>The whole planning area is very complex. County development and regional development plans must tie into the national development plan. That is good, provided the problems encountered by the different parts of the country are taken into account at national level. Counties Cavan and Monaghan contain drumlin areas with many small hills and bending roads which create many problems for planners.</P>
      <P>There is a major crisis in housing. A colleague told me of a friend who took occupation of a house six months ago. He had made commitments to it six months earlier when the house was valued at £65,000. A person buying a similar house in the same kind of private development, not in the same locality, would have to pay £105,000 today, which represents an increase of £40,000. The only short-term answer to the housing crisis is to provide more local authority housing. It is the only way to take the pressure off and ensure that house prices do not escalate out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people are entitled to their homes. There is no way that a couple, both of whom have reasonable jobs, say, a garda married to a nurse &ndash; it could be a ban garda married to a male nurse &ndash; could obtain a mortgage to buy a house. Given the current inflation rate and the likely increases in interest rates, young people must be more wary. Some have been getting their friends or <Col N="1035" /> family to put up some of the money to enable them buy a house. These extra commitments leave them in a very difficult situation, even at today's low interest rates. If rates were to increase dramatically, many young families would face a serious crisis. One only has to recall what happened in the UK a few years ago when many people had to sell their houses, at an extraordinary loss, to live.</P>
    <P>The housing situation is no different in my County Monaghan than anywhere else. There is a sizeable increase in the demand for planners. Approximately 730 planning applications were submitted in 1996. That had increased to 1,132 for 1999. So far this year approximately 250 to 260 applications have been submitted. As you are aware, Sir, many of these applications are no longer for single houses or for developments of town houses, but for large scale developments. Some are for outline developments of 100 to 120 houses. Unfortunately, some of these requests are tax driven because of the changes in taxation which allow for the sale of the land by the owner for a tax benefit. They may not even lead to the building of houses in the immediate or foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>These developments are putting extraordinary pressure on planners, yet they may be of no use to meeting the housing needs of the country in the short or medium term. In the last few weeks my council decided to increase the number of permanent planners. We looked for executive planners with some experience but did not receive a single application. Unless this situation can be eased worthwhile developments will not take place. Some businesses in my county may have been lost because of delays in the planning system. This has arisen through no fault of the planners but because of their extraordinary workload.</P>
    <P>Planners are generally doing a good job. This is evident from the improvements in the villages, the urban renewal schemes and task force moneys. However, these developments take time with the result that the number of planning applications does not present a true picture of the demands placed on planners. A lot of extra work has been placed on them, especially in the Border area, with special schemes for villages and urban renewal. I welcome that, but it is all the more reason we must ensure that there is an increase in the number of planners and other personnel if the benefits of the Celtic tiger are to spread to all areas.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration must be given to the impact of family break-ups on the housing sector. I have encountered problems here, not only in my constituency but also when canvassing recently in Dublin South-Central. Often three or four bedroom houses have only one person living in them while other family members are housed in flats or other houses. The Minister must give serious consideration to how this problem can be addressed. If young couples are to be provided with cost effective homes it is not sensible to have <Col N="1036" /> many three or four bedroom homes with single occupants.</P>
    <P>Many elderly people in rural Ireland are living alone and are getting freebies, such as electricity and telephone usage. If they were to allow part of their homes to be turned into flats it would ease some of the pressure on housing. There is a fear that these people would lose out if this were to happen, but it would be much better for them to have young people or young couples living with them.</P>
    <P>Third level participation rates in education are among the lowest in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. This is partly because no third level education facilities are provided to any serious extent with the result that students from the constituency must travel elsewhere and stay in flats or otherwise. It is becoming a serious problem.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business Deputy Currie referred to the decision by An Bord Pleanála to curtail large developments. I welcome the general thrust of the decision. In County Monaghan we have tried to ensure that shopping centres are located in the centres of towns and not on the outskirts. We decided at council level that, when the three bypasses were constructed for Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and Monaghan town, they would not allow for shopping centres or other such developments being built near them, that the town centres would be retained as shopping areas and would not be damaged by out of town development. It is important that the decision made by An Bord Pleanála is extended to other areas to ensure that genuine retail development is allowed, and that whenever large supermarkets wish to locate in a town or area, they do so in sympathy with the environment of the town.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some of the contents of the Bill. If a person wishes to object to a planning application, under this Bill he or she will have to do so at the outset. Anyone with experience of the planning process knows the plan submitted to the planners and the council as part of a planning application is not necessarily the one granted in the end. Some development may be removed or changed. It is only when the final plans can be seen by those interested in them that they know for certain if they need to lodge an objection. Under the Bill, a person would not even have the right to object to An Bord Pleanála if he or she had not objected initially. This will lead to a great deal of unnecessary objections. The cost is not the major factor, rather the technicality.</P>
    <P>I had experience of a situation recently of a young couple who took the trouble to drive to their county town to examine plans which affected them and were satisfied that they were acceptable. They found some months later, that a new developer had moved in and was going to build housing next to the couple's front door. When the couple investigated, the original plans were again shown to them and they pointed out that that could not be possible. It was checked <Col N="1037" /> and found that a number of changes had been made, possibly legally and above board. It is very difficult to be certain that plans are being adhered to. This couple came to me to point out their serious concern that their property would lose a great deal of value as a result of this development. In introducing this law, we should be careful to ensure it is workable.</P>
    <P>Planning in rural areas is something which is regulated under the county and national development plans. I objected sincerely to some of the rules included in our county development plan, but I was assured they would be used with commonsense. However, it does not always work out that way. There is potential for development close to towns, but if a land owner has developed more than two houses, he will have great trouble in developing his land further. This is not right and, if I am still a member of the county council in future, I will have this rule changed, if possible. If we are trying to encourage rural development, then it is important that people live in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The agricultural college in Monaghan is being closed and others are under threat. The likelihood of young farmers taking up the business as we knew it in rural Ireland is diminishing quickly. I was part of a committee which recently met economists who were eager to advise us that, over the next eight years, 40% to 50% of existing farmers will no longer be in business. If we are to maintain rural structures, keep parishes alive and keep young people living, going to school and playing football in rural Ireland, we must have a commonsense approach to development in rural areas, especially close to schools, churches and other centres of activity.</P>
    <P>There was a new development by the GAA recently in my parish of Aghabog. That is a tremendous move forward. The local school, which was lying derelict for some years, is being developed for many other purposes, including caring for the elderly. It is an opportunity for people to live and avail of services there. However, if the rule is that the farmer living next door to those amenities can only build two houses, then commonsense and reasonable development cannot continue.</P>
    <P>Extraordinary additional demands are being made of builders of private houses. In County Monaghan, the soil is drumlin soil and is difficult to work with. I understand that we must ensure that sanitation is provided in the best possible way, but all types of different demands are being made. I would not mind if those were placed at the time of the original application, but applicants are not advised of some of them until after, which means long delays in the processing of applications. A system needs to be put in place in Monaghan, where two thirds of the poultry and mushrooms in the country are produced, to deal with waste. That would alleviate the demands being made of private house owners. The phosphate in the water is obviously being caused more by farm pollution than by private houses. Will the <Col N="1038" /> Minister ensure that every assistance is given to use the waste material? The EU is in the process of granting a licence for a power station and heat provider and I want the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that proceeds. Our planners are eager that this would be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tight regulations covering listed property. While I do not oppose those, if people are forced to maintain listed property in a proper condition, they should be given adequate funding for that. I encountered a situation recently where an aged couple were forced to ensure their house was safe and habitable, but when they sought funding, they were advised that, unless the maintenance was carried out in a specific way, they would not receive funding, which itself was limited. If we insist on people maintaining old buildings, which are important to the nation, it is important that people receive funding for that purpose. The building in Rossmore Park had to be demolished years ago because of the extraordinary rates on it. It would have been a gallant public representative who would have said at the time that it should have been maintained and made rate free. He or she would have lost a seat very quickly. However, we have lost very important properties in that manner and the Government must ensure proper funding is made available.</P>
    <P>Proper funding should also be made available for the reconstruction of houses. My colleague on Monaghan County Council, Pádraig McNally, called on the Minister some time ago to reintroduce the reconstruction grant. He received the full support of Monaghan County Council. That grant is essential and I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would support Monaghan County Council's wishes to have the reconstruction grant reinstated so that many rural village homes could be developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this Bill which has 245 sections. It will have a huge impact on future planning in Ireland. We should scrutinise it thoroughly and table various amendments to it.</P>
      <P>Planning has become one of the major areas of contention. Three, four or five years ago the local authority in County Westmeath handled approximately 700 planning applications per annum, of which a high proportion were for once-off housing. It currently deals with approximately 1,800 applications per year, of which a small proportion are for once-off housing. There is a lot of pressure on planning offices and the public is often frustrated by the responses they get from the planning sections of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are excellent planners in my county. Our chief planner is Pat Gallagher and he has great vision and a balanced view of the mix required to maintain rural areas while developing our villages and towns. He is blessed to have a good planning administrator called Declan Leonard who gives a commitment over and above what is required in such a position. However, their office has not <Col N="1039" /> grown to meet public demand. They have not been given the staff they need to do their job efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is a scarcity of qualified planners. Numerous young inexperienced planners have been employed and generally they do a good job. However, they stay for only three, four or five months before they are lured to the private sector by offers of better salaries and conditions. They do not operate under the same pressure and they will gain valuable experience. This means local authorities must face the difficulty of finding new planners who must become acquainted with the development plan.</P>
    <P>The public's only contact with Government services is through the planning office. When people lodge a planning application, they expect to get the go-ahead to start building within the required eight weeks. However, many of them become frustrated when they receive a letter in the final week requesting further information or telling them the water supply is not as stated on the application form. A decision is then postponed on the planning application, although they may have a builder ready to start work. When they submit the information requested, it will lie in the planning office until near the end of the further eight week period because of the pressures in the planning office. The Minister should consider injecting money and staff into planning offices so the public can get the service they deserve and demand and to improve the respect people have for those offices.</P>
    <P>Planners have been hit in recent times by EU directives and legislation which impose new regulations and planning laws on them. It is difficult for them to keep pace with this change and this increases their workload.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to objectors. The Minister should be made aware of situations which can develop and of which Deputy Crawford and I have had experience. For example, a person recently submitted a planning application to build a house between two houses on the outskirts of a small village. One of the two houses was built approximately 15 yards from the public road and the other was built approximately 35 yards from the road. A previous planning application was submitted for this site and it was decided the house should be half way between the two houses so their privacy would be maintained. When a new application was lodged one of the neighbours saw it and was happy that the house would be built half way between the two houses, as originally agreed.</P>
    <P>However, six months later when the person who owned the site started to build the house the neighbours became frustrated because it overlooked their houses. When they went to the planning authority to view the plans they were told that because of a query the planning authority had relocated the house on the site to where the person was building it. The person was building it in the correct position as dictated by the local authority but it took away the neighbours' priv<Col N="1040" /> acy. When questions were asked about why the neighbours' considerations had not been taken into account they were told they had not submitted a written objection. The neighbour who had looked at the application did not submit a written objection because there were no queries about it. As a result of a condition imposed by the local authority, the neighbours were left out in the cold as the time limit in which to appeal to An Bord Pleanála had lapsed.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to protect people in such circumstances. A clause in the Bill will discommode people in similar situations. Another example is where a notice for planning permission for a large apartment block was placed on the site where the neighbours could not see it. When they discovered that planning permission was granted, the time in which to appeal to An Bord Pleanála had lapsed so they were left high and dry.</P>
    <P>This Bill states that if an objection is not made at the initial stages, it cannot be made subsequently to An Bord Pleanála. Under the terms of the Bill, if the people in the first case to which I referred had been aware of this when they viewed the planning application and found everything in order and knew permission had been granted they would not have been able to go to An Bord Pleanála. The people in the second case I mentioned would not be able to do so either because they missed the initial application. I have reservations about that clause in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must clarify who can make objections. A company called Lagan Cement applied for a major project in County Meath beside Kinnegad, which borders County Westmeath. Westmeath County Council was involved because the service road was in the county. Applications were submitted to Meath County Council and to Westmeath County Council for the service road which were granted. A group of people objected and they had genuine concerns. I respect people's right to object. However, it transpired that an outside company which had no interest in the area or the environment had given in excess of £30,000 to the group of objectors. It transpired that the money was put up by a rival company which was prepared to fund the objectors. The application went to An Bord Pleanála and to the courts to slow up the development and, if possible, to stop it. That is outrageous and the Bill should allow for severe financial penalties to be imposed on such companies as that is the only language they understand. When the court cases have concluded and An Bord Pleanála has reached what I hope will be a positive decision, the company which is prepared to fund the objectors should have to pay all legal and other costs associated with the application.</P>
    <P>The company concerned was Quinn Cement, which is a large company, and it was only interested in protecting its own interests by keeping competitors out of the market. Quinn Cement operates a long way from Kinnegad and has no interests in the area, yet it was prepared to fund <Col N="1041" /> the objections. This is outrageous and it brings the process of objecting to developments to a new low. The company should be ashamed of itself particularly when some of its own developments would lead one to believe that the procedures were not up to scratch in certain areas. It is taking court action to ensure that everything is done properly but I wonder if its own processes are in order.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála was established to place the process in the hands of an independent body. However, my difficulty with the board is that it is not accountable to anyone and I have reservations about some of its decisions. The problem is that one cannot obtain any explanation for these decisions. I have sought such explanations from the board but it will not explain why decisions are made and its attitude seems to be that one should go away and stop annoying it. There is a need for greater transparency as regards the board's decisions and questions must also be asked about when it can materially contravene a county development plan.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a number of contentious areas, including the cutting of turf. Generations of families have cut turf and households have their own plot of bog which they cut annually. However, there is an implication in the Bill that, in future, families who wish to cut their own turf will have to obtain planning permission. In a recent article in <i>The Bar Review</i>, an eminent senior counsel indicated that turf cutting may require planning permission in the future. The Bill includes an important change in the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; in the 1963 Act which could have serious implications for farmers and turf cutters. This issue needs clarification as rural communities will not tolerate such a development.</P>
    <P>There are also deficiencies in the Bill. For example, as provincial towns such as Mullingar expand, they are not creating crucial open spaces. Dublin includes parks such as Merrion Square, a beautiful oasis of greenery and leisure in the middle of the city. There are other parks in the city such as Fairview Park, the Phoenix Park and so on. However, provincial towns are being developed without such open spaces and the next generation will condemn us as politicians for not providing such parks. The Bill should stipulate the mandatory provision of town parks within developments. The Minister may say that this is a matter for local authorities. However, councils will have to compete with developers for the purchase of land which now costs about £200,000 per acre in provincial towns. Where are local authorities going to get such funds?</P>
    <P>I also refer to the provision of open spaces in housing estates. The current regulation is for 0.1 hectares to be provided per housing unit. This means that 1 hectare, or 2.5 acres, of open space must be provided for every 100 houses. However, this is not enough. In addition, the open space provided is often incorporated into the unusable corners of fields being developed so there is no <Col N="1042" /> space for young people to play football or hurling or for other recreational purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 82 is a very contentious element of the Bill on which all Deputies have received correspondence. I received a letter from the Irish Home Builders' Association which points out that, if enacted, this section will result in eight out of ten house buyers paying more for their homes in order to subsidise the two remaining houses. This could result in a 24% increase in the price of a house. Such an increase, on top of current increases, would be frightening and the association is concerned about this issue.</P>
    <P>The letter also cites the Irish Planning Institute and The Royal Town Planning Institute which have expressed serious reservations about this proposal on grounds relating to the practical workability of the scheme, particularly as detailed in section 82, the equity of the proposed scheme and its constitutionality. The letter also lists other bodies which have expressed similar concerns about the section. It is still unclear how this section will operate but the Minister needs to talk and listen to interested parties, such as the Irish Home Builders' Association, and to local authorities and others with experience in this sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill should include strict guidelines on the naming of new estates as some new developments have the most outrageous names. I am aware of a nice townland called Robinstown but an ingenious developer named an adjacent estate Sherwood Park. There is a need for regulations governing the naming of estates which should reflect the history of the area. Housing developments should include speed ramps and other safety measures that house owners subsequently ask local authorities to provide. Large developments should be phased. Often people live in conditions resembling a bomb site for a long time as development takes place. Building should be phased so one road is completed before the next is started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this complex and important Bill. If our contributions can help free the logjam in planning we will have done good work.</P>
      <P>The county manager and the county planning engineer of Cavan County Council are doing tremendous work. They are role models for the rest of the State. Other Deputies speak of a paper chase which holds up planning. That is not part of the system in Cavan. There is a hands-on approach to planning there. I can confirm that every refusal, and there are few enough, is vetted by the county manager. There are always difficulties in planning. If it was straightforward this Bill would be unnecessary. The county manager and the planning engineer in Cavan, however, are prepared to meet applicants and objectors to see if compromise can be reached. If there is a problem with an application, they will attempt to resolve it by looking at it with the interested parties. That is the way forward. We appreciate their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> Planning is not a problem in County Cavan but it is in the rest of the State. The enormous rise in house prices is caused by demand exceeding supply. It has also been artificially exacerbated by greedy people holding on to land. In this city the number of developers who hold all potential development land could be counted on the fingers of one hand. They release that land piece by piece, stifling the market and making it impossible for young couples to afford homes.</P>
    <P>The Government has proposed that 20% of developments will be set aside for affordable housing. Does that mean the other 80% will not be affordable? The Government expects young couples to purchase these non-affordable houses and, on top of that, they are expected to pay a premium so someone else can get an affordable house. It is a crazy idea, a non-starter. I am damned if we will stand for a situation where young couples would have to subsidise housing for those who are less fortunate. The young couples themselves cannot afford houses, they are mortgaged to the hilt. Every week they come to constituency clinics to ask for help.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as affordable housing anymore. Prices are crazy. People are now asking when the bubble will burst. I hope it will not because there are already so many young couples committed beyond what they can afford. They are prepared to make that sacrifice, but what are we doing to help them? Nothing. Housing for young people who cannot afford to purchase should be provided by the State. There is a way round this problem &ndash; the State could make more money available to the local authorities to build houses. It is now impossible to tell the difference between a local authority house and a private house. They are quality houses but we need more of them. It should not, however, be expected that young couples who are mortgaged to the hilt, who are being assisted by brothers and sisters, with their parents using their savings to help, should pay extra.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be the harbinger of doom but alarm bells should ring. This is becoming serious. There are no houses in the State costing less than £150,000. We are only talking about four walls and a roof, bricks and mortar. Who is profiteering? Greedy builders. The norm for new developments is between ten and 20 houses. Who is buying those houses? The very person who built them. He is holding them and renting them out. Other interest groups are investing in housing. There should be a cap put on the number of houses one person can own. If a person has a roof over his head, his neighbour is entitled to a roof over his head. These people, however, see this as an opportunity to make huge profits when money in the bank makes very little. They live of other people's rent and that is wrong.</P>
    <P>Home ownership is peculiar to the Irish. In mainland Europe people can rent for life but the feeling in Ireland is that rent is dead money. People prefer to buy as soon as possible and they should be supported. Now it is becoming imposs<Col N="1044" /> ible for young couples to do that. The Government has a duty to those couples; it must abandon the affordable housing scheme and not place a further burden on those who are already over-stretched.</P>
    <P>Scarcity of income can cause marriages to break down. Two good incomes is no longer sufficient to build a house. The garda and the nurse who fall in love are a good example. That is a common combination with two good salaries but they cannot afford to buy a house. They would not have had any trouble in the past. Now it is a strain for them and they have to count the shillings before they get married. We must refine the planning system and examine who is buying these houses.</P>
    <P>We must protect people's right to object. I am aware, however, of a case where a site was sold to a young couple who built a lovely house in the corner of a ten acre field. The farmer who sold them the land decided to sell a further number of sites given that prices were at a premium, but the couple were the first to object. They were delighted to get the land themselves but wanted this whole green area to themselves. I would call that a frivolous objection. They objected to Cavan County Council and their objection was overruled and planning was granted. They then appealed to An Bord Pleanála and are causing further delay with their frivolous objection. People are entitled to object, but if the county council overrules an objection and if the grounds for overruling it are reasonable, people should not have the right to go to An Bord Pleanála unless there is a fast track system in place whereby a decision can be made within a month. That is not happening at present and these people are aware of that. They are not alone and there are others who have gone down that avenue. That is meanness and greed and is something I would not support. We should look at our planning laws so that frivolous objections cannot hold up development for long periods. There should be a fast track system in An Bord Pleanála in such situations. In complex cases, perhaps industrial development, An Bord Pleanála would need plenty of time to make a good decision and to examine every aspect of the case.</P>
    <P>In County Meath a substantial developer, who is well known in this city, set about establishing a refuse tip. He took a lease on a 500 acre farm for ten years. Over weekends he started to tip refuse of all description, including builders' materials and household waste. Nobody really passed any remarks until a mountain of refuse started to appear and people began to query it. They rang Meath County Council which was not aware of it. An application for planning had not been made. The person concerned was contacted and eventually it came to a stop when there was a huge mountain of waste there.</P>
    <P>He was told he would have to get planning permission for which he applied. In due course, permission was refused and he appealed to An Bord Pleanála which refused the appeal. At weekends, <Col N="1045" /> however, lorries were coming in and out of the site and the mountain of waste was getting higher. Eventually, Meath County Council took stern action. He then applied to retain what he had developed and he called it a &ldquo;Heineken step&rdquo;. He claimed this mountain was for exercising horses. He did not have a mound or hilly land on which horses could develop leg muscles. Talk about coming up with ideas. To make a long story short, that application failed yet he continued to add to the mountain.</P>
    <P>Because of the failure of Meath County Council to deal with the matter effectively, local residents had to take this man to court. The judge in question, a lady by the name of Brennan, called him to the front of the court, reprimanded him and he left the court with a red face. She gave him time &ndash; the middle of this month &ndash; to remove the mound. The residents wrote to Meath County Council to request it to remove this mountain of waste since he had been refused planning permission and the tip was illegal. Meath County Council, however, said it would cause more nuisance and annoyance to move the waste than to leave it. This enforced what he had done illegally.</P>
    <P>If I, or any Member, dumped a skip of waste or abandoned an old car, Meath County Council would come down on top of us, and rightly so. Because this man had created such a monstrosity, to move it would cause too much trouble. Yet it was a nuisance to local residents. This would not be unique if this man had got away with it. He would have established a precedent in that if one creates a great enough nuisance, one will not be asked to move it.</P>
    <P>The planning people should take a more stringent view of this type of illegal activity. The story is not at an end yet as he has appealed to the Supreme Court. Perhaps the officials might look up their notes to see if they are aware of what I am talking about and follow it up. I was disappointed that the planning authority did not enforce the law to the letter of the law as it would for persons not involved in big business. I am not saying brown envelops were passed around but something happened which was not quite right.</P>
    <P>People bank roll objectors in order to prevent a development. If discovered, they should be harshly penalised. If somebody with a vested interest bank rolls locals to object to a development, if the objection is overruled and if it is seen as frivolous, although complex, the person who has bank rolled the objection should be penalised harshly. The way to penalise such people is to impose a substantial financial penalty on them which should be given to the local authority in question for further necessary development.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say whether what I will describe now is related to people trying to benefit from high house prices, but I have come across two or three cases where a person or an old couple decide to sell their large house, but before they sell, they build a dormer bungalow in the back garden. This is becoming more common as word <Col N="1046" /> spreads on what one can do and how one can make money. When these houses were originally built, they had beautiful back gardens and a nice lawn in the front. That was part and parcel of the overall development of these houses.</P>
    <P>In these cases, the couple decides to build a dormer bungalow for £80,000 to £100,000 in the back garden and sell the big house, which will be sold for in excess of £200,000. The couple then has £100,000 to save. However, they are spoiling the original house, although they will have buyers for it. As Deputy McGrath said, local residents or next door neighbours might not be aware of the planning application for the development as they would not expect it. The application is made and a public notice is put up. While people might see the notice and wonder what it is about, they are busy going about their business and may not give it further thought. Planning permission will be granted as there will not be any objections.</P>
    <P>The dormer bungalow not only spoils the original house, although there will be buyers, but it interferes with the rights of people who bought at the same time on the assumption that their back gardens would be quiet and peaceful without anybody overlooking them. It is something about which we need to be careful. I know we are looking at green areas on which to build houses but people's rights must be protected. People can spoil a good development. I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind that that is happening. I also ask him to ensure that young people do not have to shoulder the burden of the high cost of housing. More money should be made available to local authorities to enable them to buy tracts of land in their county areas and they could then make such serviced land available for private development. The money should be targeted in that direction, but a further burden should not be placed on young people who cannot afford to buy houses at current prices. None of us can predict what the future holds. None of us can look into a crystal ball and predict that house prices will remain at the current level or fall or whether interest rates will increase or decrease. We must be extremely careful how we address this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the Bill. It is timely that public representatives addressed this major issue. The sooner we enact legislation in this area the better, although I have major reservations about some of the provisions in the Bill, particularly the social housing aspect to which Deputy Boylan referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When agricultural land is rezoned for housing or another use its value greatly increases. It seems that the sky is the limit in that regard. We read reports in newspapers of astronomical sums being paid for rezoned land. At the stage it is proposed to rezone land, a certain amount of that land should be handed over to the local authority or bought by it at its value prior to its rezoning and held in a land bank for housing, industrial or amenity use or for some other purpose it considers appropriate. The people who own land will <Col N="1047" /> stand to make perhaps millions from the simple act of their land being rezoned. They are the people who are benefiting most at this time. The local authority should ring fence a certain amount of that land for use as it considers appropriate. That measure would short circuit many difficulties and the land would be available to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the young people in the Visitors' Gallery to the House. If we continue as we are going, those young people will not be able to afford housing of any sort. I fear that the Government's proposals will introduce an awkward and difficult mechanism into the planning process. It will ensure that land that is not zoned for housing will be far more expensive because market forces will apply. That is not acceptable. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this issue. Many of his party colleagues are concerned about it. There would not be anything wrong in the Government revisiting this issue and taking it in hand at the rezoning stage. That is when it should be addressed. That would be a simple, workable and sensible measure. I ask the Government to consider that.</P>
    <P>I come from a part of east Cork with which the Minister of State is familiar, as he is a frequent visitor and always welcome. That area is undergoing a massive housing and development boom at present. Houses and development sites are springing up all over east Cork and the same is happening in other parts of the country. The road infrastructure in east Cork is not capable of dealing with this volume of traffic. As the Minister of State is aware, for the past two and a half years I have advocated that the rail link to Midleton should be reopened. I raised this issue with the Minister of State at another forum. I fear that if that rail link is not opened soon, it will not be possible to open it as all the land around the rail link will be built on. The same applies to rail links in other parts of the country. It is increasingly difficult to gain access to the rail link to Midleton. The reopening of rail links should be considered in planning and the rail link to Midleton should be reopened now. There is no point in waiting any longer. I call on the local county council, the Minister for Public Enterprise and Iarnód Éireann to move quickly to reopen it. It must happen sooner or later as the volume of traffic on the roads in east Cork is frightening &ndash; and it is getting heavier. A development of three thousand houses is planned for one small village in east Cork. Such development is out of control. When planning housing development, account must be taken of the provision of schools and green areas and such planning is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With the increased volume of traffic on all roads, including by-roads and main roads, cyclists and pedestrians find it increasing difficult and dangerous to cycle or walk on country roads. When it comes to planning and development, we must make provision for cycle paths and walkways. We must reclaim some of the minor roads for cyclists or pedestrians or build new walkways <Col N="1048" /> and cycle paths, otherwise people will only be able to travel by car because it will be too dangerous to cycle or walk on our roads. I ask the Department to consider that proposal when it introduces ministerial planning guidelines. When the Minister issues planning guidelines, the Bill provides that An Bord Pleanála, local authorities and others must take note of them. That is welcome. That means that if Deputies raise an issue with the Minister in the House or privately, he can issue planning guidelines and they must be noted by local authorities and others. This is important. I am sure all Members would agree that as elected representatives we must also have an input into policy in this area.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about certain bodies, such as the National Roads Authority. There are major safety concerns in my area and I am sure the same could be said for other areas around the county. There are safety concerns about making right turns off the N25 in my area and identifying those turns at night. The residents of the villages of Castlemartyr and Killeagh have been crying out for years for some type of pedestrian crossings. I am informed that the National Road Authority refused to meet the local elected representatives to discuss the matter. That is no way for such a body to act. The Minister should call in the representatives of that body and tell them that democratically elected members of a local authority want to meet with them, that a written formal request from the county manager will be submitted and that the body should facilitate them and listen to what they have to say, otherwise it should be disbanded. It does not make sense that representatives of the National Roads Authority are not prepared to meet local representatives, especially when people crossing the road have been knocked down and killed. A number of people have been knocked down and killed on the road in Castlemartyr in recent years. The residents have asked us to make representations but we have been ignored by bodies such as the National Roads Authority. That is not good enough. I feel strongly about that, as do my colleagues in the area.</P>
    <P>From contacts with constituents, I am aware of their concern about the cost of housing. Housing is very expensive and people are spending a great deal of money buying houses. Buying a house is a major choice that people make. They are of the view that if they buy a house in a small development of 50, 60 or 100 houses in a <i>cul de sac</i> their house will be in a quiet area. People find it difficult to park their cars outside their houses because the roads in estates tend to be narrower, but that is another issue. Often the next field is zoned and developed and what was a <i>cul de sac</i> becomes a thoroughfare for another 100 or 200 houses, and there may have been no sign that this was going to happen when the houses were bought. People should be alerted to such a possibility. If housing estates are too big there will be a huge increase in traffic going through. For the safety of children <Col N="1049" /> playing, estates should be planned so that traffic is diverted out of <i>cul de sacs</i> into a main thoroughfare. It should not be channelled through narrow roads in housing estates, causing grief for the people who live there.</P>
    <P>In addition, when there is one development after another problems are created by heavy construction traffic trailing mud all over the original estate where people have spent a fortune on housing. We should have better planning to avoid that. What is needed is a regional plan for an area rather than planning willy-nilly, developing one field and then the next and so on.</P>
    <P>People are often anxious to build stand alone houses in rural areas and there is increasing resistance to that because of the risk of polluting ground water with sewage and so on. Biocycle units seem to work, but there is a problem in servicing them. Local authorities do not have the power to ensure they are serviced on a regular basis. If it were possible to include in the Bill a provision requiring that existing units be serviced regularly so that they will function properly, we might overcome the problem of ground water pollution in the countryside. I am told by certain engineers that this is difficult and that it is one of the reasons engineers are slow to allow such housing in rural areas. Perhaps the Minister might consider it and come back to us.</P>
    <P>The problem of locals being able to purchase property in their area is a problem nationally. When a house comes on the market in a place such as Ballycotton, which is a beautiful seaside resort, people from cities and from overseas buy it up to use as a second home. This is happening more and more around our coast, especially in beautiful scenic areas. This means that during the off-season many of the houses are empty. However, local people cannot buy houses there because they cannot compete in the market. This is a major problem in places like Ballycotton where local people are being squeezed out and there are more and more houses lying empty for much of the year. It also causes problems for schools, shops and so on when communities like that are being slowly decimated, and local people have to fall back on local authority housing in towns. Perhaps the Minister might consider if there is a way to ring fence and preserve housing for local people in areas such as Ballycotton and other seaside areas.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned by many of my colleagues already that the work of planners and engineers in local authorities has increased dramatically in the past few of years. Many of them are attracted to the private sector by higher wages and better conditions, and there has been a steady haemorrhage of experienced and talented people from local authorities. The outcome has been a slowing down of the planning process because we do not have enough experienced staff. Privatising the whole system might be the wrong thing to do, but something has to be done to ensure that local authorities have adequate num<Col N="1050" /> bers of planners and engineers. Often, public representatives discussing a planning application on behalf of a constituent, as we are elected to do, discover that every couple of weeks a new planner is dealing with it. Planners have to understand everything and often have to postpone decisions because they do not have time to visit sites and check files. This is frustrating not just for the planner but for people trying to build a house or a factory.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that planners can be subjective in their approach to certain proposals. One planner will grant permission for a certain development or a certain feature in a house but another will take a different view. That can cause difficulties. Perhaps there is some way of standardising such matters.</P>
    <P>Although I can understand the pressure they are under, I am perturbed by the behaviour of some mobile telephone companies who put up masts without planning permission, sometimes in the dead of night, and then apply for retention, even though they have been told by the local authority that they should not put them up. When they are told to take them down they appeal to An Board Pleanála. This is an abuse of the planning system by such companies which should be stopped. It is not good enough that they should behave in that way. That is not the purpose of the retention clause in the planning legislation.</P>
    <P>There have been objections in east Cork for some time to the construction of ESB pylons in the area. As the matter is before the courts, I will not say too much about it. The case is linked to the proposals in the Bill to restrict the rights of people to object to planning proposals and the methods by which they can do so. The difficulty is not that there are too many objections but that the procedure for dealing with them is cumbersome and slow and we do not have mechanisms in place to deal with objections speedily and efficiently. I would seriously question the wisdom of curtailing people's right to object. They have to have a right to object. There is a danger that if we prevent people objecting formally or put obstacles in their way, they will find other ways to do so. I welcome Cork County Council's initiative in setting up a forum to deal with the concerns citizens have about super dumps in the Cork region. It has set up a forum, and has funded objectors to carry out their own investigations. This is open and transparent and facilitates the objectors. If, in relation to the ESB pylons, An Bord Pleanála had allowed an oral hearing matters might have been resolved. However, An Bord Pleanála refused and the matter still has not been resolved to the satisfaction of either side.</P>
    <P>We have to be very careful when dealing with planning and rezoning. A great deal of money is being made out of this. Tribunals have been set up to investigate certain practices which are costing the State a lot of money, and we have to make sure this does not happen again. Tribunals are important. We must get the systems right and if <Col N="1051" /> wrongdoing took place in the past, it must be discovered and sorted out. The people involved must be punished, and be seen to be punished. It is important to ensure that this type of alleged behaviour does not happen again.</P>
    <P>Planning and development is the major issue because it concerns almost every aspect of life at present. There will be another major scramble in the autumn involving college students seeking accommodation in the cities. This is linked to planning and development because the current grants for students are totally inadequate. They face a huge problem trying to find accommodation.</P>
    <P>We must move towards higher density in terms of housing, but this must be properly planned. More apartment living must be considered. Many of the apartments being built are not suitable for families. They are only suitable for summer accommodation and single people. We should consider building apartments which will suit families but if that is done, they must have security of tenure. The rents would have to be fixed so families and students cannot be exploited.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, although we have reservations about many aspects of it. The provision which would require builders to finish housing estates before they leave should be rigorously enforced. Incomplete housing estates are a major problem. Builders make their money and go, leaving a huge mess behind. This problem impinges on the quality of life of the people living there.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Bill is most timely and could not be more relevant. It will assist in the implementation of the national development plan. It is a comprehensive Bill with 245 sections and it has been discussed in the Seanad. The last Planning Act was introduced in 1963, a considerable time ago.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about housing and county council land banks. My county council has a considerable number of land banks but it is becoming increasingly difficult to get contractors to build local authority houses. It may be due to the Celtic tiger but contractors appear to be extremely busy. When the council advertises for a contractor to build housing, it receives tenders but a number of units could be completed by the time they can start work. Previously when the council advertised for contractors to build houses, it had no problem getting a builder. When the tenders were opened, there could be 20 contractors applying to develop up to 50 houses and building would start within a number of months. However, this is not the case now. Contractors do not appear to be available; they are all too busy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that some local authorities will allow farmers' sons and members of their families to build on the family farm. It is difficult for people to get planning permission in rural Ireland at present. I am delighted that some county councils, and particularly the county man<Col N="1052" /> ager and planning officer, get together and give permission to a farmer's son or daughter to build a house on the family land. This is a step in the right direction. If the aim is to maintain the rural population, it is not right to stop family members who want to live beside their parents or other family members from building a house. It is only right that this should happen given the huge cost involved in buying a site anywhere in Ireland these days. I am glad farmers' sons and others will get planning permission.</P>
    <P>I welcome the great work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in providing housing and finance to build houses. The introduction of affordable housing is fantastic. Many great social housing schemes have been built over the years and all local authorities should encourage them. People should avail of them.</P>
    <P>A number of applications for houses on national primary roads have been granted permission under section 4 motions. I do not want planning permission to be granted in the future for houses on national primary roads because of the level of traffic on them these days. It is dangerous, particularly if it is a narrow road and one has to turn off to a house. All applications for houses in such areas should be refused and I am not afraid to make that point. It would be a shame if houses were built on the by-pass in Mullingar. There is an excellent garage on that road which serves food. One can easily turn off the road to it. Although people have got permission to build houses on national primary roads in the past, such developments are too dangerous, particularly for children. Such applications should be rejected in the future.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for making money available for local improvement schemes on non-county roads. If such a scheme has been done well by the county council and people are living in houses at the end of the road concerned, the county council should take it over. The sons and daughters of the people living in the houses should be given planning permission to build houses on nearby roads. The roads are repaired with money made available by the Department under local improvement schemes, but the council will not take them over because it considers that it already has enough roads to maintain. There are 1,400 miles of county roads in County Sligo and the council will not take on any more. These roads should be taken over and maintained in the same way as the roads in housing estates are taken over after they are surfaced with tarmacadam to the satisfaction of the local authority and adequate lighting is provided.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities are finding it difficult to get planners at present. They have advertised for planners but it is difficult to get them because there is a shortage in this area. More planners are required now than ever before because of the increasing level of applications. Tubbercurry, County Sligo, was a small town but, since the introduction of rural renewal, is no longer so. The first application made was for 39 <Col N="1053" /> houses, the current application is for 55 houses and I understand a subsequent application is to be made for 85 houses. I welcome this development but objections to planning applications are delaying the process. When an objection is made to An Bord Pleanála, it takes several months to process it. If objections could be dealt with in two months rather than five or six months, that would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of our national primary roads which are being built as far away as possible from houses. I understand that planning permission will not be granted along national primary roads and I hope that is the case.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the erection of mobile phone and television masts which are very unsightly. People are concerned about the health implications of these masts when they are erected near their homes. I would like to see them being erected far away from built up areas. An Taisce has objected to these masts on occasion but it has also objected to the location of rural houses on farm land which is an unwelcome development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the requirement to set the walls around rural houses a certain distance away from the road. A significant number of stone walls is being built around new houses in rural areas and that is to be welcomed as it adds to the character of an area. That should be a requirement in all planning applications. Rather than building plastered, whitewashed or pebble-dashed walls, people should be encouraged to build stone walls. There is plenty of good stone in the country and plenty of stonemasons to craft it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to address a Dublin-based issue which is intimately tied up with this Bill. I refer to the future of Dublin Bay. Recently, Dublin Port attempted what could be described as a &ldquo;smash and grab&rdquo; raid to infill 52 acres of the bay on the basis that infill material was coming from the Sutton pipeline and the port tunnel. Its effort has been temporarily halted by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources who decided that the port's environmental impact survey was inadequate. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government signalled that such applications will be considered as planning applications in the future. He intends to introduce a provision on Committee Stage whereby the port board will, in future, be able to go directly to the planning authority to seek planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that development is welcome on one level, the manner of its operation will be crucial. If we allow a situation to develop whereby the port authority in Dublin or elsewhere can make an application to a local authority without the development plan having been materially contravened or varied, people will be robbed of their democratic right to have a say in the manner in which key amenities are developed. The Dublin Port application will, doubtless, be refused by Dublin Corporation and will then be appealed to <Col N="1054" /> An Bord Pleanála. It is crucial that if the Minister introduces an amendment providing for planning permission to be sought for port infills of this nature, the legislation must explicitly provide that such applications can only be considered following a variation or material contravention of the development plan. That would ensure that the process would remain in democratic control and that the corporation would have an opportunity to advertise its intention to vary the plan and to specify permissible uses in various parts of the waterways involved. It would also ensure that applications would not be solely driven by commercial opportunism without proper regard to Dublin Bay's amenities. Dublin people will expect the Minister to ensure that this legislation will protect the bay.</P>
    <P>People may be somewhat unnerved by other aspects of this legislation which seem to suggest that the right of third parties to object or raise concerns about planning applications is being eroded. It is crucial that this would not happen in relation to Dublin Bay which is a unique amenity. Few cities in the world can boast access to such an amenity. Although we have been slow to develop the bay for recreational purposes, that is now happening and there is a greater recognition of the bay's natural beauty and amenity value. The Minister must be conscious of that and provide for proper democratic controls. I have spoken to Deputy Dukes about this issue and I understand he will table amendments on this issue if the Minister's amendment is not adequate.</P>
    <P>I am extremely suspicious of the erosion of people's right to object to planning applications. I do not see any problem with people raising objections. If the planning system worked properly, even a contested application would be decided upon within seven months, the time limit clearly set out in the primary legislation in regard to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála. Applications are not taking longer to process because of third party objections, but rather because the administrative structures are not capable of dealing with the workload.</P>
    <P>The possible introduction of fees for objectors and the restriction of appeals to those who made submissions the first time around would be very wrong. People were not aware of the port infill proposal, which was advertised in a very limited way by the port, until the closing date for objections was upon them or had passed. Under that provision, those people would be denied the opportunity to appeal planning decisions. Many people may miss the first opportunity to object to an application and when it comes to their notice, they will find themselves statute-barred from making an appeal. That should not be a feature of our planning legislation. There are many other ways in which we could deal with delays in the planning system without eroding people's fundamental right to make an appeal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the provision whereby planning permission can be refused in <Col N="1055" /> circumstances where there is a consistent history of failure to fulfil planning conditions. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and other Members will be aware of maverick developers in their constituencies who move from one estate to another leaving a trail of mayhem behind them. However, the provision envisaged by the Minister is extraordinarily cumbersome. The notion that planning authorities must first form an opinion on applications and then seek authorisation from the High Court to refuse maverick developers will put the onus entirely on the wrong parties.</P>
    <P>A developer should be obliged to take a High Court action in order to have a refusal lifted on such grounds. A local authority may have <i>prima facie</i> grounds for a refusal on that basis. For example, it could have very good grounds because it is aware of a developer's past record in the relevant county or city and such knowledge should be acceptable in terms of issuing an initial refusal. The onus of taking a High Court action to overturn a refusal and the costs involved in doing so should be placed on the developer. I hope that refusals will only be overturned when developers have put to rights previous developments they have undertaken.</P>
    <P>Apropos of that, I wish to raise with the Minister an issue in respect of which he replied on a previous occasion by stating that he had no interest in taking action. I refer to the role of management companies in privately developed estates. Many of the apartment developments throughout Dublin city are not taken in charge, at any stage, by the local authorities and they remain under the control of management companies. There is no legislation which regulates the behaviour of such companies and the Minister stated that it is based on the contract between the relevant parties. The reality is, however, that many people move into apartments or houses and developers either do not establish management companies or fail to honour their obligation to deliver quality services to those who have taken occupation. Residents of these developments cannot seek the protection of the planning authority which shows that there is a gap in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents the best opportunity we will have to introduce controls in the area to which I refer. Under the legislation, it will be a normal condition that a management company should be established but the necessary enforcement powers will be absent. We must consider the inclusion of specific provisions in the Bill to deal with management companies in order to ensure that they take their responsibilities seriously. As I understand it, the provision to enable a majority of residents to have an estate taken in charge by a local authority will not apply to estates developed privately with private management companies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of a time limit in respect of enforcement action. That is a good development. However, will the Minister indicate if we are just fooling ourselves in this regard? Planning enforcement in the Dublin area is wholly ineffective because of a lack of resources. <Col N="1056" /> It is great that a warning letter will be issued after six weeks, an enforcement letter will be issued after 12 weeks and that everything will be hunky dory after 18 weeks. However, that is not what is happening in reality. People are driving a coach and four through the planning legislation, proceeding with unauthorised developments and eventually wearing down the patience of planners and obtaining planning permission by allowing sites to become derelict. If we are to have a proper enforcement system, adequate resources must be provided. How will this be achieved?</P>
    <P>I also welcome the establishment of strategic development zones. The role of such zones goes beyond the sphere of industrial development. Let us consider the Dublin 15 area, through which the Minister probably passes on his way home each weekend, and the education provided there. In certain areas, classrooms are laid out in community centres each morning and taken apart again each evening so that normal community activities can proceed. The reason for this is that the Department of Education and Science has no strategic development plan to match the populations of housing developments with schools. The same can be said in respect of transport and other infrastructural services.</P>
    <P>If local development plans are to include strategic development zones, the Bill must include the power to put pressure on the Department of Education and Science and other agencies to put the necessary resources in place. I am open to correction by the Minister but, as I understand it, if a strategic development zone or any other local zone is put in place, planning permission cannot be refused or conditions imposed to the effect that it may only proceed on the basis that schools will be provided to deal with the influx of children. That is not possible. We have put forward the notion of strategic zones in the belief that they will provide for infrastructural development, transport, etc., but the legislation does not state that developments will be delayed if the services to which I refer are not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Once plans are put in place, the system of development becomes driven by developers. We must put a stop to that and the Bill represents the best opportunity for the Minister to do so. We must ensure that statutory power is put in place in order to ensure that schools, transport and other infrastructural services are provided when a strategic development zone is being established. Developers should be stopped in their tracks if that does not happen. The provisions to which I refer are not included in the Bill, not even in the section dealing with strategic development zones for industry where, for example, it is intended that transport services will be properly developed in tandem with the zones. The Bill is flawed in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions relating to local plans but, again, progress in this area will be hampered by a lack of resources. This year Dublin Corporation has £250,000 to provide local development plans to cater for the 300,000 houses occupied by <Col N="1057" /> over 1 million people. That money will not have any impact. It is great to introduce provisions dealing with local development plans but I believe they will not proceed.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to housing and the new formula for qualification &ndash; 35% of net income after the deduction of tax and PRSI &ndash; with which the Minister has come forward in respect of affordable housing. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing development is present in the House and I wish to ask whether he will be extending that formula to the shared ownership scheme. As he is aware, given the rise in house prices, the existing limit of £20,000 is not realistic. There is a need to increase the limit substantially if those on the middle ground are to be accommodated. The Minister of State will be concerned that this will make it even more difficult for people on the bottom rung of the ladder.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's initiatives are not working in Dublin. A year after he announced the introduction of affordable housing, not one affordable house has been built in my constituency. I am informed by the housing section of Dublin Corporation that affordable housing will not be provided in my constituency during the next 12 months. It will be the end of the year at the earliest before any affordable housing provided by the Minister of State's scheme comes on stream. There is something radically wrong. I know the Minister of State has tried to put in place initiatives but there are serious delays in making affordable housing available. Effectively, it will be two years before a single house is provided under the scheme. The Minister of State must discover why it is taking so long for land to be made available for the development of socially affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The scheme of socially affordable housing has the potential to be successful in Dublin. That is not the case with the shared ownership scheme which will encounter increasing difficulties in the future, particularly as renting is no longer an attractive option in light of low interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Bill is like the curate's egg, it is good in parts. If we can amend the weaker provisions and put in place a proper democratic process to protect the amenity of the bay, we will have done a good day's work.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mar a dhein na cainteoirí a labhair anseo ar maidin agus le cúpla seachtain anuas fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo. Tuigeann gach duine go bhfuil géarghá le súil ghéar a choinneáil ar chúrsaí pleanála ar fud na tíre. Tuigimid chomh maith an dlúthcheangal atá idir tithe a chur ar fáil do na daoine agus cúrsaí pleanála. Go minic tá an dá rud sin fite fuaite le chéile. Má tá géarchéim de chineál ar bith sa tír seo i láthair na huaire sílim go bhfuil an géarchéim sin i gcúrsaí tithíochta. Tá, ar ndóigh, dlúthbhaint idir sin agus cead pleanála. Níl fhios agam an dtugann an Bille sin faoi na fadhbanna sin go léir a fhuascailt. Tá fhios agam go dtuige<Col N="1058" /> ann an tAire Stáit é féin ón áit a dtagann sé ó iarthar na hÉireann goidé chomh tábhachtach is atá an cheist seo.</P>
      <P>The Minister has missed a major opportunity to stamp his persona on the future of planning and development into the next century. This Bill is technocratic and tidies up the loose ends of the Planning and Development Act, 1963. In the 40 years since that legislation was introduced, the remit of Government has changed completely. In those days, we were emerging from a long period of economic decline, massive emigration and reduced demand on resources. At the beginning of this third millennium, the opposite is true. There is economic growth due to the Celtic tiger, a rapidly increasing population and major demands for improved and increased developments in the infrastructure of the State in the next 20 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>This Bill pays lip service to the Brundtland Report which in 1987 enunciated the European Union's position on sustainable development. It is noticeable that while in the past 20 years we have paid lip service to EU environmental initiatives and proposals, it has been reluctant to provide local authorities, who are the main operators in this area, with the necessary funding to implement its proposals. There is a range of indicative objectives in this Bill and in the national development plan regarding water, sewerage, telecommunications, transport and pollution control. However, there is no indication that necessary funding will be put in place to meet such objectives. This Bill provided a golden opportunity for the Minister to ensure the entire population is directly involved in the future control and development of our wonderful natural environment. Sustainable development which, to a large extent, leaves the environment intact for the next generations can occur only when there is a Government commitment to its achievement.</P>
      <P>Section 4 relates to exemptions from planning permission and subsection (1)(<i>f</i>) refers to development which is carried out &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; a local authority. This should be deleted because it is open to abuse by opportunistic contractors and others. Section 4(1) makes planning permission compulsory for the planting of forestry. Would the Minister not consider it worthwhile to give exact guidelines regarding the distance from inhabited houses, roadways, streams, rivers and so on? If he does not do this, the local authority may decide on a completely different range of distances in the operation of this regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II, section 9, states that each planning authority shall make a development plan every six years. What will the Minister do about local authorities who do not complete their plans and request extension after extension while rampant and often unbridled development is taking place in their areas? Part II, to a large extent, contravenes the democratic right of councillors as elected representatives and affects planning authorities in the exercise of their duties. To strengthen the position of elected representatives <Col N="1059" /> and the planning authorities, it will be necessary to change the section under which An Bord Pleanála can grant planning permission in contravention of the county development plan. Before the manager grants permission for work to commence, it should be referred to the county council, which, if it so decides, should take an initiative on a material contravention of the development plan as initiated. Where such an initiative occurs, planning permission should not be granted until the council decides to grant that material contravention and include it in the county development plan.</P>
    <P>The change made in section 36(1) is too restrictive. The existing provision should apply so that any citizen has the right to appeal until An Bord Pleanála grants permission. Under the Bill, if a citizen does not appeal a planning permission to the local authority, he is not allowed to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. Often, a person may not be in the country when a development is advertised and permission may be granted unknown to him. This section is restrictive as such a person should have an opportunity to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>There is a correlation between the granting of planning permission and housing. There is a major housing shortage and people cannot afford to buy houses. There are more than 40,000 people on local authority housing lists, which is probably the highest figure ever. In my county there are about 2,000 on the housing list, which is also one of the highest figures ever. This is because of the escalating price of houses and building sites, not only in Dublin but throughout the country and ins na ceantair Ghaeltachta mar a thuigeann an tAire é féin.</P>
    <P>Ní rud íontach ar bith anois é go mbeadh ar dhuine a bhfuil fonn air teach a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht £40,000, nó £50,000 nó fiú níos mó ná sin a íoc ar shuíomh. Go minic ní daoine ón Ghaeltacht iad ach daoine a thagann isteach mar is beag duine ón Ghaeltacht atá ábalta airgead mar sin a dhíol.</P>
    <P>De réir an Bhille, duine atá ag iarraidh forbairt a dhéanamh ar shuíomh fá choinne tithe a thógáil go mbeadh céatadán áirithe de na tithe sin saor sa dóigh go bhféadfadh an gnth dhuine iad a cheannach. Níl fhios agam an bhfuil sin chun an fhadhb a réiteach. Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá gceannódh na húdaráis áitiúla an talamh iad féin agus go gcuirfidís na seirbhísí ar fáil ar phraghas réasúnta do dhaoine a bhfuil fonn orthu tithe a thógáil in a gceantair féin.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach mbaineann sé seo go hiomlán le cúrsaí pleanála ach is cinnte go gcuireann sé isteach go mór orm féin, ar ionadaithe poiblí eile agus ar an Aire Stáit go mbíonn deacracht mór ag daoine atá ina gcomhnaí in a gceantar féin le blianta fada cead pleanála a fháil le teach a thógáil ar a dtalamh féin in aice len a muintir féin.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid a bheith réasúnta agus freagrach ach sílim gur chóir dúinn aire faoi leith a thabhairt d'iarrachtaí mar sin mar tá cúrsaí pleanála agus luach tithe ceangailte le chéile. Ó tharla go <Col N="1060" /> bhfuil an tAire Stáit anseo ba mhaith liom a rá fosta nach dtugann na deontais atá ar fáil fá choinne tithe i láthair na huaire cuidiú do dhaoine tithe a chur ar fáil dóibh féin. Is £3,000 atá ar fáil i láthair na huaire in aon chuid den tír agus is íontach íseal an méid é sin. Tá £4,000 ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus tá sé thar am go mbéadh an deontas sin ardaithe. Bhíomar go léir ag súil go gcuirfí deontas ar fáil chun tithe a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>There are many old homesteads throughout the country which have not been used for years. These could be renovated if there were incentives from the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department provided generous grants for a number of years before 1987. Indeed, I believe they were introduced when Fine Gael was in Government. The Minister will recall that during the 1980s there were substantial grants for the renovation of old homesteads. Planning permission is not required for renovation because the structures already exist. They might need to be reroofed or otherwise improved so the planning process can be bypassed. It is a matter of repairing a building that already exists but has fallen into disuse. There must be incentives for such work. The grants given in the 1980s amounted to £4,000 or more for renovating a pre-1940 house. This would be another means of solving the housing shortage. Country people should be given an incentive to purchase these properties and renovate them. That would remove some of the pressure on planning offices.</P>
    <P>The planning office in Donegal has a huge problem due to limited staff resources. I understand that we do not yet have planning officers qualifying in this part of the country. They appear to qualify in Northern Ireland and then come to the Republic. I am not aware of any plans to establish a town and country planning faculty in our third level institutions although I could be out of date. There was a post-graduate course available&mdash;</P>

If we are to loosen the logjam, there must be more planners. There must also be more flexibility if we are to tackle the housing problem. Not only must the planning process be improved but incentives must be provided for new houses or for renovating old houses.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt ar an mBille seo. Although the Bill was published on 23 August last, it is still exercising people's minds. A number of aspects have caused considerable comment and annoyance. There has also been a welcome for the provisions which tighten up some areas that required it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> In his introductory comments, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said something with which no Member could disagree. He said the planning system of a prosperous Ireland should be guided by three principles &ndash; a strategic approach, an ethos of sustainable development and performance of the highest quality. These are excellent aspirations but if one examines the Bill and Government related activity, one can see they do not as yet apply. We live in hope.</P>
    <P>With regard to the approach being strategic, the national development plan was announced in a way which declared the amounts of money to be spent in different areas. However, that put the cart before the horse because a spatial plan was not in place at the time of the announcement. To talk about the spatial plan being produced at a later date indicates that we are remiss and have not learnt lessons from the past.</P>
    <P>The crisis in public transport, which will be discussed later today, is symptomatic of the problem which arises from not having public transport infrastructure in place and having no spatial plan to ensure that people live close to where they work and to other facilities. These things appear to be afterthoughts. All too often in the past they have been afterthoughts. We have much to learn. It is not a question of reinventing the wheel. These issues have been well thrashed out in other countries. Our EU neighbours can speak from experience and I hope we will learn quickly from that experience.</P>
    <P>The second principle to which the Minister referred was sustainable development. This is one of those phrases that is thrown around like confetti at a wedding, although that is now illegal under the Litter Pollution Act. Many people mistake sustainable development for sustained development. Indeed, some are quick to metamorphose the phrase into sustained growth.</P>
    <P>The point of sustainability, as the Taoiseach said in relation to Sellafield, is that one knows when enough is enough and one has an idea of where to go when that point arrives. One knows whether to focus on quality of life when one can no longer work on the quantity or whether one goes somewhere else and focuses on decentralisation, not deconcentration as Deputy Roche described it on the radio yesterday. Deconcentration appears to be more likely to happen than decentralisation.</P>
    <P>For me, sustainable development means the Earth Summit in Rio, Agenda 21 and participation by the public. One of the main criticisms of this Bill is that participation by the public is hampered. The Minister will put forward the reason for that but the fact remains that people will not be able to participate in the planning process after a certain point, whereas they could previously. That does not appear to be an improvement under the Agenda 21 criteria.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said the planning process must be of the highest quality. One cannot argue <Col N="1062" /> with that and we wish it were so. Anybody who deals with a local authority, as most Members of this House frequently do, will be aware that the number of planning applications submitted over the last ten years has trebled even though the number of staff in planning departments has remained static. Indeed, many are attracted to the private sector so there is a large number on career breaks from their original employment. They are attracted by the larger remuneration and better prospects in the private sector. Getting planners to fill the vacancies is difficult. That situation is contrary to the Minister's aspiration to have the highest quality planning procedures. That is the opposite of the aspiration in the Bill for the highest quality in terms of planning procedures. The staff is not in place to ensure this. As a result, mistakes are made and things are overlooked, especially if, for example, applications are submitted before Christmas and other public holidays. If a person wanted to, he could write a book about ways of working the planning system to take advantage of inherent weaknesses brought about by the creaking machinery in the local authorities because of staff problems and shortages.</P>
    <P>While these three aspirations in the Bill are lofty and admirable, they are prone to misunderstanding and are unlikely to be adhered to because we have a long way to go. They present a huge challenge. I hope there is the will to meet it.</P>
    <P>With regard to streamlining the planning process, it was mentioned in a seminar on the Bill on 29 September last that the planning process now aims to benefit planning authorities and developers. There is a widespread perception about this. Many on the Opposition and Government benches have pointed out that the imposition of a fee on the submission of an observation or an objection will mean that people will think twice before they comment. There is no harm in thinking twice, but there would be an outcry if people had to pay to vote. This proposal steps over the bounds of democracy, participation and Agenda 21, which the country signed up to. I hope it will not be proceeded with. There is little enough faith in the planning process without jeopardising it any further.</P>
    <P>The proposal that people may not make an observation to An Bord Pleanála if they have not submitted an observation or objection at the original planning application stage means that those who, by doing their best to keep the so-called Celtic tiger alive were unable to screen all the planning applications submitted, are penalised for their hard work. They are also penalised if they have been living outside the country &ndash; after all, we are now told we live in a global village. There are many ways in which people will be incensed by this provision. The Government is making unnecessary trouble for itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got it wrong when he says the provision is limited to those who show an interest in the initial application. Many parties &ndash; chari<Col N="1063" /> ties, non-governmental organisations and people who work hard &ndash; may be interested in a submission but they do not have the time to scrutinise everything. It is not only unfair but it contravenes the Arhus Convention on access to information, public participation, decision making and access to justice, especially on environmental matters. It is likely that this will open another avenue to legal challenges, as if we did not have enough of them.</P>
    <P>The proposed charge on making a submission will turn an opportunity to comment into a privilege. That is undemocratic and it should not be implemented. Three steps should be taken. First, the proposal to charge a fee for making comments on planning applications at local authority stage should be abolished. Second, the restrictions on the rights of third parties to appeal or observe when the planning stage reaches An Bord Pleanála should be abolished. Third, the obligation on the planning authorities to grant planning permission in areas designated as strategic development zones should be removed.</P>
    <P>This last point is a cause of concern. As an example, there have been a number of incidents, some very serious, in the Cork harbour area involving pharmaceutical plants. Most of them adhere to the rules and safety criteria. Yet if a plant does not adhere to the same high standards but complies with the strategic development zone, in that it is, for example, a pharmaceutical company, it must submit a proposal for a licence to the EPA before the plant comes into operation, but only after the plant has been built. This effectively means that millions of pounds could be spent on a dubious development because it complies with the strategic development zone criteria. It is a risky scenario. The planning authorities should be given far more discretion, using the planning expertise at their disposal. The Minister has acknowledged their planning expertise and they should not have their hands tied by the designation of strategic development zones. I hope the Minister will refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <P>A number of points on planning have been raised with me. The development of wind power in this country has been very slow by comparison with developments in other EU countries. It has been suggested to me by the Irish Wind Energy Association that our planning laws should focus on the zones around the country not where wind power would be acceptable, but where it would be unacceptable. In that way communities who want to benefit their own areas, or companies who want to work in partnership with local communities, would be able to look at their county development plans, or the national development plan, to see where it would be a waste of their time to seek planning permission. This would enable them to better determine where they can focus their energy.</P>
    <P>We are very bad at developing broad leaf forestry. One of the reasons for this is our tradition of planting trees where nothing else will grow in terms of a useful economic return. A focus on the <Col N="1064" /> acid and alkaline brown soil areas, where broad leaf growth could be considered, would enable developers to consider planting broad leaf trees, which we badly need. Thankfully previous generations took a longer view and planted them. We still have some, but not much, of their legacy.</P>
    <P>The issue of landfills and incinerators is close to my heart. They are a cause of concern to virtually all the constituencies represented in this House. Both are elements of the waste management plan which allows local authorities to form regional alliances to provide a single facility in a lowly populated area, although such a facility would affect communities wherever it was located. The Bill should concentrate more on local treatment of waste. That could be dealt with in a development plan. A depot could be constructed which would be a collection point, and other facilities could be provided which are vital if we are to succeed in reducing waste. Considering that we have increased waste by 40% in the past three years, a considerable effort is needed to turn that around. It also needs to be done quickly, urgently and effectively. The Bill could note that.</P>
    <P>One repeated criticism of housing, especially in areas where it is planned and badly needed, is that it is such a rushed job that it tends to be a concrete jungle of houses of the same type. There are acres of three bedroom semi-detached houses in suburban areas. While such an approach addresses an immediate need, in terms of the long-term future of communities, when families grow to a couple with children and then reduce when children leave home, there needs to be a mixture of housing.</P>
    <P>In terms of decentralisation &ndash; there is a difference between that and deconcentration which is often referred to when discussing the moving of Departments &ndash; Rural Resettlement Ireland has done a marvellous job and I pay tribute to it in setting a trend of moving away from cities people who are in a position to do so, and creating space, vitality and life in areas and schools which may have suffered depopulation. I wish the Government could do more for it. I hope the Bill examines that issue.</P>
    <P>An issue which arises in my constituency, as I am sure it does for other Deputies, is people's entitlement to light, especially in the context of the leylandii tree. It has the potential to grow to a height of 100 feet and a width of 15 feet, it does not allow anything to grow within 12 feet of it and is, unfortunately, not restricted in planning. The Bill should include a provision in this regard because it is a terrible blight on people who must live with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a short contribution. One of the difficulties with the Bill is that it continues the existing system without changing even the method of work. County development plans are generally drawn up in a hurry by busy planners and county managers. They are put together in such a way that councillors and the public discover the difficulties much later. The county development plan for Clare was approved last September, and the former chairman who proposed the plan was threatening section 4 actions in December. The Minister should have set guidelines for local authorities devising county development plans The process should be done area by area and there should be development areas within a constituency or county. It should begin with four or five areas and be continued on an ongoing basis. It would make for better planning and would connect with the public in that they would have an opportunity to see what is proposed. As it stands, the development plan publication is viewed as a nuisance by local authorities.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons local authorities do not have architects on their staff is that architects would have to be given responsibility for this role in the county development plan. If no architect is involved, there will be no problems with the good ideas he or she might devise for the county. A Deputy tabled a question recently asking about the number of county architects employed, and there are very few. The profession was created because architects are different from planners. It is wrong that planners should have an architectural role. There is also a problem with the employment prospects for an architect employed by a local authority. If the Minister allows contract solicitors to provide legal advice to local authorities, the same should apply to architects, and I am sure the profession would oblige in that matter. I do not know why the Minister would not then insist on county development plans being devised by the appropriately qualified people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding contraventions of county development plans, it comes down to a political voting block voting one way or the other depending on what is politically right at the time. It does not have anything to do with proper planning in the county or the area, and that is regrettable. My party would be as guilty as the others in that <Col N="1066" /> respect. It is for that reason an ongoing examination and creation of county development plans is desirable. It would bring about a greater understanding on the part of the public as to what is involved and it might give people the opportunity to develop a spatial or landscape policy within a county. We have no proper landscape policy and I do not know if the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development have met to discuss that. I did not hear any Member who spoke on the Bill mention it. It is possible, even at this late stage, to rescue some of the great landscape developments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</P>
    <P>The lack of waste disposal systems is a major problem. A great effort was made by the Department to get schoolchildren to help with recycling waste, but unfortunately the Department has withdrawn the subsidies at a time when we are experiencing huge growth. I do not know if the Minister has reconsidered grant-aiding primary schools to encourage them to set up a recycling system. This system seems to be working in areas of County Clare where teachers set it up. I pay tribute to some of the major companies in Clare, such as Dunnes and Tesco, which have designated special areas where tins, glass and other waste products can be disposed of. This has helped to segregate the waste.</P>
    <P>Clare County Council put forward a number of proposals for a new waste disposal site. A plan was drawn up behind closed doors. People in the Inagh area are unhappy with the way the council and other experts examined this new location. I do not understand how the National Roads Authority could accept this undeveloped site which is along a national secondary route. It is right that Clare County Council's application for a licence to the Environmental Protection Agency has been challenged. The local authority has given minimal information to the public. There should be more consultation with the public. If meetings took place and people were briefed properly, there would be fewer concerns about the difficulties which arise in these areas.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Department for the way it orders new sewerage developments in certain areas. There was a hullabaloo before the last election, particularly between 1992 and 1994, about the water quality in Lough Derg. Consultants repeatedly said that the Nenagh and Scariff sewerage schemes were affecting it and that something should be done about it immediately. However, the Scariff sewerage scheme has not been started. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on this issue a number of weeks ago. Clare County Council sent an application to the Department two years ago but it has still not been approved. I do not understand that. If good water quality is the aim of the Department, surely priority should be given to allocating funds to the county following the recommendation of the consultants employed by the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> Deputies have received letters from the Irish Home Builders' Association about the Bill. The latest letter referred to section 82 which, if enacted, would result in eight out of ten house buyers paying more money for their houses to subsidise the remaining two houses. That is the view of the Irish Home Builders' Association, the Irish Planning Institute, the Royal Town Planning Institute, the Consumers' Association of Ireland and other bodies. Will the Minister review the proposals in section 82 before Committee Stage? According to Ciaran Ryan of the Irish Home Builders' Association, the Bill will have a significant impact on second hand house prices. He believes there is an opportunity to make a change through consultation. Has the Minister met the Irish Home Builders' Association? It has stated it will always be available to meet him and to discuss any aspect of this matter.</P>
    <P>Planning is a matter for all Departments. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, for example, has a role to play in developing areas for heritage purposes. Has an expert group been set up in the Department of the Environment and Local Government to provide advice? Is there liaison between Departments so that the difficulties are outlined? Are decisions by Dúchas or the time it takes for it to make a decision analysed? Are other Departments experiencing the same difficulties which are currently holding up progress in building new houses?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will give a comprehensive reply to the contributions made in recent weeks. I do not disagree with the Government Chief Whip's intention to take Private Notice Questions at 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le gach Teachta a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht ar an mBille tábhachtach seo: An Bille um Pleanáil agus Forbairt, 1999.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who took part in the debate on this important Bill in recent weeks. I appreciate the positive and constructive approach taken by Deputies even if there is not agreement on every aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that this Bill is the result of a wide-ranging consultation process with the public and all the major stakeholders in the planning system. While it is impossible to meet everyone's wishes, the Bill strikes the right balance. Efficiency must be balanced against the need for full consideration of all the issues, physical development to provide for our social and economic needs must be balanced against the protection of the environment and housing needs must be balanced against the operation of the property market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue which almost every speaker raised was the need to provide the resources to ensure that the Bill's provisions can be put into effect by local authorities. I agree this is the biggest chal<Col N="1068" /> lenge in implementing the Bill. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, readily acknowledged that in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office, the Government has taken a pro-active role in seeking to increase the resources, both professional planners and otherwise, of local authority planning departments. In April 1998 my Department wrote to planning authorities asking that they avail of the opportunity presented by planning fee increases, which were effected by new regulations at the time, to consider the possibility of employing more professional planners. My Department again wrote to local authority managers in July 1998 asking that they review the adequacy of their professional, technical and administrative clerical staffing in order to ensure the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to consumers. The Department has approved almost all requests for additional professional planners since. The most recent survey of local authority planning departments carried out by the Department showed that the overall level of administrative and professional serving staff in county councils and county borough corporations had increased to almost 900 in September 1999 compared with 753 in May 1999 and 660 in June 1998.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also been in contact with Ireland's only planning school in UCD. He wrote to the president of UCD indicating that the expansion of the economy has made for a greatly increased workload on the planning system and that there is evidence of a shortfall in the number of professional planners available to meet present requirements. The letter indicated that the Planning and Development Bill and future EU requirements will confer further functions and place new obligations on planning authorities and on An Bord Pleanála. All these developments will call for increased professional planning resources and any increase in the number of planners qualifying will be welcome.</P>
    <P>I express my thanks for the work of planners and local authorities. I appreciate that everyone is under pressure to deal with the huge increase in planning applications. The number of applications rose from 39,500 in 1993 to 67,000 in 1998, the highest on record, and the final figure for 1999 is likely to be over 75,000. This will represent a doubling of applications in the past seven years.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to sound complacent, the system has shown a remarkable increase in productivity over the past few years. In 1998, 69% of all planning applications were decided by local authorities within the statutory two month period. This represents only a small drop from the 73% of applications dealt with within the two month period in 1993 and suggests that some of the more extreme claims about the system creating huge delays may be exaggerated.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a new set of challenges to local authorities but I am confident in their ability to meet them. The new local government fund <Col N="1069" /> introduced last year has put local authorities on a firm financial footing and will ensure that they have sufficient funds to carry out their functions efficiently and effectively. Last year the fund made £625 million available to authorities towards their general day-to-day expenditure needs and their non-national roads programmes. The figure this year should exceed £665 million. Notwithstanding the importance of providing local authorities with funding to meet their needs this year, the legislation governing the new fund goes even further. It guarantees that the Exchequer contribution to the fund will be adjusted annually, at least in line with inflation, and that account will also be taken of the emerging expenditure needs of local authorities. This means that any extra costs which authorities face as a result of the new planning regime will not be overlooked. On the contrary, such costs must, under the law, be factored into consideration when the size of the local government fund is being decided in the future. The Government is the first to ensure under law that extra responsibilities for local authorities are coupled with extra resources.</P>
    <P>There was some confused thinking on the Opposition benches regarding the provisions in Part V of the Bill. Deputy Michael D. Higgins accused the Government of being in cahoots with the building industry. Deputy Dukes stated that the provisions of Part V would not work because the CIF is opposed to them. This indicates that we are doing something right. Deputy Dukes also contended that one of the reasons the provisions of Part V would not work is that it would not increase the supply of land and suggested other means of achieving the provision of affordable housing such as allowing local authorities to build houses or provide sites, or when granting permission requiring that 20% of houses be made available at an affordable price. The Deputy will find that his thinking is closer to the provisions in the Bill then he realises.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a whole will deliver better and more up-to-date development plans which will allow for better forward planning. It is also important to bear in mind that the housing strategies which must be prepared under the Bill will identify total housing needs and will address the specific needs of different sectors of the population, for example, first time buyers, single person households, the disabled and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no reason addressing the need for social and affordable housing should reduce the supply of private housing. The Bill specifically requires local authorities to ensure that sufficient land is zoned for housing development and that a scarcity does not arise. The Bill will allow local authorities to build houses or provide sites and will facilitate developers in providing affordable houses in estates which they build.</P>
    <P>This issue of supply was raised by the Irish Home Builders Association in its submission which was referred to by many Deputies. The <Col N="1070" /> IHBA carried out a high profile campaign against the provisions in Part V of the Bill and made some one-sided and misleading statements in the pamphlet sent to Deputies and in its expensive newspaper advertisements. It is not possible in the time available to answer all the statements, but a few points cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged.</P>
    <P>The IHBA incorrectly claims that the Bill will not help first time buyers or those on the average industrial wage. The average industrial wage is just over £16,000 and the eligibility criteria for affordable housing in the Bill should, having regard to present price levels, offer the prospect of affordable housing to such people. The vast bulk of affordable housing will be for first time buyers. The IHBA also failed to take account of the benefits to it of higher residential densities which, in many cases, will more than offset the proportion of sites to be reserved for social and affordable housing. The association contends that the provisions would raise the price of land for the 80% of houses not required for social and affordable housing. However, house prices in the present sellers market are determined by how much the builder can get on the market and bears little or no relation to the costs of providing the house.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the price of houses is in any way being kept at a reasonable price by members of the IHBA in the absence of these proposed measures. On the other hand, the proposals should moderate the huge increase in the value of land conferred by zoning for residential development because developers will have to factor the requirement to reserve a quota at existing use value into what they are prepared to pay for land.</P>
    <P>The IHBA also dismisses the Government's efforts on increased residential density and the serviced land initiative. Contrary to the impression it attempts to give, I reassure the House that returns available from local authorities confirm that the target of producing an additional 100,000 sites by the end of this year will be realised through the completion of current water and sewerage schemes. The association seems to be working to an agenda of social exclusion, particularly with its idea that land be specifically zoned for social housing. For the good of society the Government is committed to working for social integration and rejects any such proposal which is akin to a new form of apartheid. In support of its case, the IHBA produced a carefully selected line of comments critical of the Government's proposals in the Bill, some of which may be taken out of context. For example, there is a quote from Peter Bacon, taken from his second report in April 1999, which predates by five months publication of the Bill. I will not bore the House by quoting from the many knowledgeable people who supported the Bill, including the editorial in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke of the need to expand the social housing programme. The Govern<Col N="1071" /> ment's approach is two pronged, to increase traditional local authority house building and to expand voluntary housing activity and output under other complementary schemes such as the shared ownership scheme. This year will see the beginning of the four year multi-annual programme for local authority housing to provide 22,000 local authority housing starts. Significant increased funding is being provided for voluntary housing and site acquisition. Funding has been included in the national development plan for the provision of over 15,000 dwellings by the voluntary sector. I am surprised that I continually have to repeat to members of local authorities and Deputies that the construction of local authority and voluntary housing is only a part of the picture for social housing. A further range of social housing measures is available to local authorities to supplement their housing programmes in meeting social housing needs. With the increase in local authority and voluntary housing programmes, together with output from the complimentary social housing measures, and casual vacancies occurring in existing local authority stock, the needs of more than 50,000 households will be catered for over the next four years. Would it be too much to ask Opposition Deputies to stop equating the number of local authority housing starts with the number of households housed from the waiting lists? That is not the full picture.</P>
    <P>Section 164 requires local authorities to take housing estates in charge where they are requested to do so by the residents. This applies to existing estates and I assure Deputy Gilmore that there is no need to re-introduce the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill concerning unfinished estates. Deputy Ryan, the sponsor of that Bill, welcomed the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies suggested that builders should be licensed. The 1997 report of the Strategic Review Committee on the Construction Industry included a recommendation for a registration system for building contractors and subcontractors. In December 1999 the Forum for the Construction Industry submitted an interim report setting out preliminary detailed proposals for the registration of contractors, including subcontractors. My Department is now considering the report, the implementation of which would require legislation to protect the title of registered contractor. The Minister has accepted the forum's proposals in principle and, subject to a number of modifications designed to enhance the coverage and independence of the registration system in the interests of consumer protection, these views have already been conveyed to the forum and a response from it is awaited.</P>
    <P>There was general agreement that the revised enforcement provisions in the Bill were welcome but that resources were needed to make sure they worked. As well as my general commitment to providing resources to local authorities, the Bill provides that any fines or costs incurred by a planning authority in taking enforcement action will be recoverable. This will provide an incentive <Col N="1072" /> for planning authorities to operate the system effectively.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the fee for making submissions and observations on planning applications and the requirements that third parties will have to make a submission to appeal a decision to An Bord Pleanála. I assure the House that any such fee will not be at a level which will deter any person or body who is genuinely concerned about a planning application. The Bill gives significant statutory recognition to submissions made in respect of an application. Submissions, therefore, will have to be given full consideration by planning authorities. People who make submissions will be entitled to be notified of the planning decision and will, therefore, be in a position to appeal to An Bord Pleanála if necessary. The rights given to third parties in the planning system are unprecedented in the European Union. No other state gives unlimited rights of appeal to an independent body.</P>
    <P>Third party appeals make up 40% of all appeals to An Bord Pleanála, a rise from 30% ten years ago. With rights go responsibilities and it is not much to ask that those with an interest in a planning application should voice their concerns at local level before taking their appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>We also intend to look at the planning regulations to see if the various notification provisions can be improved. Improvements would ensure that everyone is aware of when submissions or observations on a planning application have to be made and that people have sufficient time to comment on an application.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the national spatial strategy, which the Government sees as being of crucial importance in translating its policy on balanced regional development into a more detailed blueprint for spatial development throughout the State over the longer term. Some Deputies have suggested that the two year time scale set for preparing the strategy is too long. That would be the case if we wanted to produce a rushed, poorly thought out and ill considered proposal that would be of little use or relevance to the development of the regions. That is not our intention. The Government is determined that the strategy be comprehensive and well thought out. The preparation of the strategy will be subject to an extensive bottom-up consultation process, involving all levels of Government, the social partners, private sector organisations, regional and local authorities, community level organisations and the public generally. A commitment to such a consultation process has been included in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>Given these parameters, the two year time frame for the production of the spatial strategy represents a considerable challenge. One has only to look at the time scale for similar exercises in other countries. It is, however, a challenge which we are determined to meet. In the meantime, immediate investment decisions, based on the national development plan, to provide urgently <Col N="1073" /> required basic infrastructure will not be delayed pending the development of the national spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes questioned the transfer to An Bord Pleanála of the functions of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the approval of CPOs and road schemes. The Government considers this change to be appropriate. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has responsibility for setting out policy in relation to local authority infrastructural development and promoting and funding broad programmes of investment. It is appropriate that decisions on individual projects be left to an independent expert body. Deputy Dukes stated that under the present system the Minister could discuss matters with concerned people. Adjudicating on CPOs has always been a quasi-judicial role rather than a policy role and the Minister has always been constrained in his actions in this area. It is a role which suits An Bord Pleanála and I note that Deputy Olivia Mitchell, the Fine Gael spokesperson on transport, welcomed the proposed transfer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore made the accusation that the Bill did not integrate transportation with its provisions. A cursory glance at the main provisions of the Bill for development plans and regional planning guidelines shows this is clearly not the case. Deputy Gilmore stated that the Planning and Development Bill should challenge but had failed to do so. I agree that it should challenge; the Bill poses huge challenges. When the Minister for the Environment and Local Government started the review of planning legislation he said the planning system of a prosperous Ireland should be guided by three principles &ndash; its approach must be strategic, its ethos must be one of sustainable development and its performance must be of the highest quality. That was the challenge and the Bill meets it successfully. In their joint submission, the Irish Planning Institute and the Royal Town Planning Institute stated that they believed the Bill would achieve the Minister's objectives for the planning system. Independent endorsement is always welcome and Deputies do not merely have to take my word for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore has been inconsistent in opposing the deadlines for the adoption of a development plan while, at the same time, calling for development plans to be made every five years instead of every six years, as is provided for in the Bill. The whole thrust of the development plan provisions is to provide for a two year review and adoption period which allows for extensive and open public debate in the first year followed by a more formal adoption procedure in the second year. The idea is to resolve issues of principle early in the process so they do not become sticking points toward the end.</P>
    <P>The Bill also enhances the role of the public representative and improves public consultation in relation to the development plan. The objec<Col N="1074" /> tive is to encourage a sense of ownership of the plan in the community which it serves and among the councillors who will adopt it. The draft development plan has, in the past, been seen as a manager's or planner's document to which councillors react. This could result in planners becoming defensive about the draft plan and the public reacting negatively to it. Under the Bill, the thrust of the new procedures is to involve the public and councillors at the earliest stages of planning &ndash; before the draft plan is produced.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke of the difficulties in selling single sites or getting planning permission for one-off housing in rural areas. Refusals for one-off houses are based on the provisions of development plans which, in turn, are matters for local councillors. It is no use people complaining about the provisions of a plan which they have adopted. We must, however, be imaginative in our approach. Local authorities make every effort to facilitate planning permission to those people who must live on their farms but urban generated, one-off housing in rural areas creates problems with groundwater protection, access to roads and protection of the landscape. I fully support the policy of maintaining vibrant rural communities but this can best be achieved around villages rather than in ribbon development. The challenge, therefore, is to make development plans which facilitate the objectives of vibrant environmentally sustainable rural communities. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is strongly committed to building up the physical infrastructure of existing small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>There is no attempt in the Bill to prevent councillors from obtaining full copies of submissions on development plans, as has been suggested by a number of Labour Deputies. The Bill provides that the manager must prepare a report on submissions made in relation to a development plan in order to summarise and highlight the issues raised for the benefit of councillors. Councillors are not precluded from considering the original submissions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming considered that public bodies should have to undergo the same rigorous procedures as private individuals in the planning system. The State is required to obtain planning permission as with any private developer save in certain circumstances related to justice and national security. Local authorities have to undergo the Part X procedure. The Bill considerably tightens up this procedure which is now contained in section 163. This requires the planning authority to give the same evaluation to its own development as it would to a planning application. The decision on this development is a matter for the democratically elected members of the council.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have decried the position given to the manager in the planning process as against the position of the elected members but when power is given to the members, as in section 163, they protest as loudly. The Government is com<Col N="1075" /> mitted to enhancing the role of the elected member. The strategic policy committees will see the extension of a national partnership-type model to local government and will deepen the policy making role of councillors. The local government reform programme is geared towards developing and enhancing the role of councillors and practical measures, such as the development and implementation of a training programme for councillors, have been introduced.</P>
    <P>The proposed local government Bill, which the Minister hopes to publish in this Dáil session, will provide a legislative basis for our new local government system. It will help to tilt the balance in favour of the democratically elected members by providing for a range of mechanisms for the councils to oversee and shape the implementation of local authority policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious matter. I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for their assistance and all the Deputies who tabled questions. I will give some of the background to this matter and then home in on some of the points made by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>The dispute relates to a claim by the NBRU for a 20% increase in the basic pay of the Dublin Bus drivers. On 11 October last the Labour Court found this claim to be in breach of Partnership 2000, but recommended that an independent third party carry out an investigation of a range of issues on which there was wide disparity between the parties on the factual position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third party concluded that the current pay claim would place the future viability of Bus Átha Cliath in jeopardy, if conceded in isolation. <Col N="1077" /> However, it also indicated that some inflexibilities still exist in work practices within the company and that there are significant opportunities for cost savings, which could form the basis of a productivity deal to address the basic pay issue in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Having considered the third party report, the NBRU instituted strike action with a one day strike on 15 February. Intensified strike action was suspended when agreement on a framework for negotiations was reached on 22 February. Since then there have been a number of negotiating sessions under the auspices of a chairman nominated by the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>At these negotiations, Dublin Bus tabled proposals which would achieve cost savings in excess of £9 million, sufficient to fund the pay claim lodged. The NBRU responded that it was not prepared to negotiate new productivity measures such as those proposed by Dublin Bus. Instead it tabled alternative proposals based on existing productivity and restructuring agreements which the company estimated would generate savings of about £2 million.</P>
    <P>The NBRU subsequently served renewed strike notice, beginning with a two day strike on Friday and Saturday, followed by a three day strike on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 28, 29 and 30 March, a four day strike the following week and an all-out strike from 10 April.</P>
    <P>The Government considered the dispute at its meeting on Tuesday. A Government statement was issued this morning indicating that it is seriously concerned about the planned strike and regrets the impact this will have on public transport users and the Dublin economy. In its statement the Government called for the suspension of the proposed strike action and for an immediate resumption of negotiations. The Government believes agreement is possible but emphasised that it will have to be based on genuine productivity and restructuring measures. The parties also need to take into account the pay and taxation terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which will increase living standards for workers by about 25% over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the disruption which this dispute will cause for the customers of Dublin Bus and the impact it will have on the business life of the capital. I re-echo the Government's call for the suspension of the strike and the immediate resumption of negotiations. Dublin Bus has made it clear that it is prepared to negotiate an increase in basic pay, provided it can be financed by productivity and restructuring measures. The Government fully supports that position.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the NBRU to immediately resume the negotiations on the productivity and restructuring package, which will address its pay claim on a non-cost increasing basis. In that event, the good offices of the Labour Relations Commission will be available to assist the parties to reach an early agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> If the dispute goes ahead, the Garda Siochána and the Director of Traffic will take appropriate traffic management measures, including the temporary opening of bus lanes to general traffic and an intensification of traffic control and enforcement measures. I encourage commuters to walk, cycle or car share so that all opportunities can be availed of. This matter is very serious.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates asked me the basis on which the Labour Relations Commission ended its talks. It suspended them because the NBRU said it saw no further grounds for continuing talks, but the LRC remains available as it always is for any dispute. Dublin Bus management has also said it remains available today, tonight, tomorrow and over the weekend to continue to talk about this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>This is a serious matter. I join the Minister in appealing to the Dublin branch of the NBRU which is meeting tonight to suspend its action in view of the hardship it will inflict on people who depend on public transport.</P>
      <P>In relation to the third party mediation, the comment that the gap was too large to fill at the point at which negotiations concluded was attributed to some person. Is that the Minister's view or does she feel some other form of third party mediation would bridge that gap?</P>
      <P>Has the Government considered contingency arrangements to alleviate the hardship that will be suffered by people trying to get to work, students trying to get to school or the elderly trying to get to hospital? I am not talking about the Army, I am talking about using other modes of public transport to facilitate people. Has the Minister information about whether, if this turns into an all-out strike, it will spread to the rail services, to DART, to Bus Éireann? Is there a risk of that or has she been assured that will not be the case?</P>
      <P>Under the code of practice relating to disputes procedures, including procedures in essential services there is provision in section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to put in place, through the Minister for Enterprise and Employment a code for essential services. Would the Minister have discussions with the Tánaiste about such a code for future situations, because surely this is an essential service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Government be open to increasing the subvention to Dublin Bus if a productivity deal could be done? In previous transport debates it was noted that our subvention to Dublin Bus was the lowest. This is a political question. It is a matter solely for the Government. As a gesture of goodwill, in terms of pushing this into the medium term, so that we can have a productivity element and a public transport element as well, will the Minister increase the subvention <Col N="1079" /> to Dublin Bus in circumstances where this is resolved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a comment, to the effect that the gap between the sides was too large. I read that statement in the paper but I do not recall to whom it was attributed, the Labour Relations Commission or the NBRU. Clearly if the £9.2 million in savings which Dublin Bus say their proposals would achieve amount to the 20% &ndash; and that is just in Dublin Bus &ndash; it would immediately be sought by Bus Éireann and by Iarnród Éireann. It is clearly a fact that the gap is too large.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned other modes of public transport in emergency cases. During the last one-day strike the Garda and others moved traffic very quickly and the use of the bus lanes was allowed. We will certainly be looking at emergency needs, but I do not know yet in what fashion. Such an issue has to be looked at.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested introducing a code for essential services. That was being looked at during the term of office of the last Government and by this Government. I do not know how far the Department of Enterprise and Employment has gone with that in working through the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As far as I can recall, a mechanism is outlined in the programme, but I would need to get clarification on it from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked whether, if a productivity deal could be done, the Government would consider an increase in subsidy. The difficulty there is that those who are seeking an increase of 20% would automatically link that with the increased subsidy and there would not be in that, any improved services for commuters; there would not be changes of routes and there would not be extra routes which would be needed to provide a better service. We will continue to look at that outside of a strike in the ongoing debate on productivity and restructuring.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that several deals were concluded that manifestly breached Partnership 2000? Why should a different rule apply to the low-paid workers in Dublin Bus who are doing a very stressful and difficult job on a basic pay ranging between £227 and £273 per week? Why can a deal not be concluded, if a deal was concluded for other significant groups in the public sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the hardship that is now in prospect for tens of thousands of commuters, does the Minister have any advice to give to them, other than that they may cycle, walk or car share? That does not seem to indicate an understanding of the situation. Does the Minister not understand that we are now embarking on what could be a very intractable dispute and that if it is not resolved over the next 12 hours, and certainly if it is not resolved this side of this weekend, we could be into long-term difficult indus<Col N="1080" /> trial relations as far as transport is concerned in Dublin where the situation is already extremely difficult?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand very well the serious nature of what is facing us. It might be helpful to let the House know that last week, prior to St. Patrick's Day, on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I had a series of meetings. I met separately with the NBRU, SIPTU, the Labour Relations Commission and the four worker directors on the board of CIE. I listened very carefully. We had a very good exchange of views. I understand very clearly. What I regret deeply is the hardship to people. It is all very well for us here because we can get to our workplace. There are many people who will be unable not just to get to their workplace, and that is serious, but to hospitals, social engagements and so on. Part of their daily lives will be denied to them.</P>

      <P>Ten days ago I was berated in this House because the former Chairman of CIE said I had intervened in labour relations and that I should keep my nose out of business. Last week I had a series of meetings with all of the parties. It is very glib to ask what I am offering. I cannot offer the commuters of Dublin anything, but I can ask the workforce of NBRU again to take up the offer of Dublin Bus and the Labour Relations Commission, who remain ready to restart talks.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also spoke of manifest breaches of Partnership 2000. They were concluded and agreed on the basis of restructuring and/or productivity. There was manifest productivity in return for manifest breaches. That is what Dublin Bus and the Government are seeking in this proposal. I wish I could offer some comfort to the bus users, but I cannot, as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three questions. The first is probably rhetorical. Would the Minister agree that everyone depends on public transport, whether they are using it themselves or are in the black Mercedes that cannot get from one place to another because the traffic is not moving? Ultimately we depend on buses operating. More are badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister about both the short-term and the long-term. The Minister mentioned cost savings and restructuring. Will she give more information about what hard pressed bus drivers <Col N="1081" /> are being asked to do to save more money apart from taking low wages? What is meant by restructuring, given the view of Dublin Chamber of Commerce that new legislation for either competition or privatisation is still in the realms of discussion? Will the Minister outline what she meant by restructuring?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that the Government faces a crisis in terms of split responsibility in the area of transport between the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which has responsibility for quality bus corridors, cycle lanes and other matters, and her Department, which has responsibility for the public transport companies? Is there a need for a single Department with responsibility for transport and a single transport plan which would be integrated and be ahead of the spatial plan and the national development plan rather than follow them much later?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone depends in an immediate or related way on public transport. The Deputy asked about the proposed cost savings. They were tabled by Dublin Bus and included a variety of issues. I do not have the list with me but I met the management of Dublin Bus last week and it has sought to put forward a variety of issues for some time. The issues are wide ranging, but the NBRU did not entertain them. It said they were too far reaching and wide ranging.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the chamber of commerce, restructuring and privatisation. Last November the Government took a formal decision, as I mentioned previously at Question Time, and asked my Department to engage in consultation on the review of the 1932 Act with the objective of increasing competition. Advertisements were placed in newspapers and we received a range of submissions which are being discussed with those who put them forward. Dublin Bus, the NBRU, SIPTU and many others made submissions. Almost every private operator in the land put in a submission.</P>
      <P>The Department is considering those submissions and is consulting people. This process has started and, on 11 April, I will bring forward the results of it to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure, which comprises half the Cabinet and the Attorney General. It appears from questions put to me outside the House that people are talking about privatisation. However, I am not talking about that. There is a need for properly funded public transport and every major metropolitan area in most developed countries has such a system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for a properly subsidised and run public transport company. There is also a need for an element of competition within the greater Dublin area. This relates to buses, not heavy rail. An element of compe<Col N="1082" /> tition will not be introduced in that area because there is a different gauge, etc. Bus Éireann by default has developed huge competition. Every other bus on the road has a person's name written on its side. This arose by default through the club system and the court ruling in that regard. However, a legislative shape needs to be put on the situation.</P>

There is a difficulty in this area and it will be among the matters that will be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government has been actively engaged in consultations with the British Government and with the relevant parties aimed at securing the earliest possible restoration of the Executive and of the Assembly. These efforts are continuing and will be intensified in the coming period.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is meeting with the British Prime Minister at the European Council in Lisbon today, and on Tuesday the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In these meetings, we have been able to build on the contacts we have had, both before and during the St. Patrick's Day period in Washington, including the meetings the Minister, the Secretary of State and I had with all of the parties in Belfast on 7 and 8 March. This has allowed us to take stock of the current situation and to assess how best to move matters forward now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our discussions have, I believe, identified some <Col N="1084" /> common ground; everybody wants to see all the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement implemented in full. Nobody wants to renegotiate the Agreement. Everybody wants to see the institutions, which made a significant difference during the short period of their operation, up and running again as soon as possible. We are looking for a basis on which this can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Once again, however, we will have to overcome a deficit of trust on all sides if we are to be successful. We need to create a positive dynamic in which all sides provide and receive necessary assurances, including that violence is not an option and that democratic inclusivity is the only way forward. As both the Taoiseach and the Minister have stated, we need to place the issues we have been discussing in a wider context of trust and confidence building.</P>
    <P>The challenge before us is substantial. However, we have overcome difficulties in the past and I am convinced we can do so again now. We could never have come so far had the parties, and perhaps most especially their leaders, not been willing to demonstrate courage, flexibility and generosity. The same qualities are called for now.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Government will continue to do all it can to create the right environment for progress but others must be prepared to do likewise. Work must be done to address fears and insecurities on all sides. Constituencies on both sides will have to be stretched. However, as we approach its second anniversary, I know that the parties, like the people, North and South, remain committed to the Agreement and all it has to offer. I remain confident that, with the right approach, it will be implemented in full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the twin principles of self-determination and consent informed the approach to the Good Friday Agreement and that the Irish people, for the first time since December 1918, determined for themselves that they wanted the Agreement implemented, including the principle of consent, by voting overwhelmingly for it? Will she confirm, therefore, that decommissioning is a condition, if not a precondition, of the Agreement and will she inform the House where the Government now stands on this agreed decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to confirm, on behalf of the Government, that decommissioning is an indispensable element of the Good Friday Agreement; indeed, I do not believe we would have had any Agreement unless that particular aspect of illegal weapons was addressed, as it was in some detail. We want to see the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I believe that the decommissioning aspect will be achieved in the context of the overall implementation of all aspects of the Agreement. The issue of arms must be dealt with in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important at this stage that all parties pro<Col N="1085" /> vide each other with the assurances necessary to secure progress, namely, assurances that we are all committed to an inclusive approach and convincing and credible assurances that violence is a thing of the past. In our work with the British Government and the parties concerned, we have focused on broadening the context in which that trust and confidence can be built.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that the Government values the pluralist approach of parties in this House to the Northern Ireland peace process over and above the pan-nationalist approach adopted by a handful of self appointed so-called soldiers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Government took office, it has greatly appreciated and continues to appreciate the cross-party support for our efforts to resolve our recurring difficulties. It is well known that particular difficulties are being experienced at the moment in view of the suspension of the institutions and in the absence of sufficient progress on decommissioning. We want to get the institutions up and running again as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>From our contact with the parties, there is evidence of an all round commitment, particularly from the protagonists, to the early restoration of the institutions and the full implementation of the Agreement. There is now an even more keen awareness, acknowledgment and understanding that it will not be possible to progress from the current difficulties unless there is a collective willingness to adopt a new approach to the achievement of the common goal of the full implementation of the Agreement. Over the past few weeks, we have tried to create space for people to rebuild trust and we will continue to do that over the coming weeks. We cannot simply continue to have a process which stops and starts with trust being built up and subsequently undermined. I thank the Deputy for his understanding of the current difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, it was decided at the Cologne European Council in June 1999 to convene an Intergovernmental Con<Col N="1086" /> ference with a mandate to examine institutional changes necessary for enlargement. It was agreed that the conference would deal, in particular, with issues left unresolved at Amsterdam, including the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council, as well as other necessary amendments to the treaties, consequential on enlargement.</P>
      <P>At the European Council in Helsinki last December it was agreed that the Intergovernmental Conference would convene in February 2000 and would aim to conclude by December 2000. As regards the agenda, it endorsed the focus on the issues remaining from Amsterdam, as well as other necessary amendments arising in the context of enlargement and the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty. It was also agreed that the Presidency would report to the European Council in June on progress made in the conference and on any proposals for additions to the conference agenda. It is also intended that there will be a brief progress report to the meeting of the European Council this week in Lisbon but, given the focus on employment issues, a substantive discussion is not envisaged on this occasion.</P>
      <P>As the Minister with overall responsibility for these negotiations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs attends the ministerial sessions of the Intergovernmental Conference, including that held in Brussels on 20 March. It is envisaged that the Intergovernmental Conference will continue to meet monthly at ministerial level, to coincide with meetings of the General Affairs Council and to take forward the work of the preparatory group. The Irish member of the Preparatory Group is Mr. Noel Dorr, former Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs. In view of the importance of these negotiations, arrangements have been put in place for wide ranging interdepartmental consultations, chaired by my Department, covering all aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference agenda. This, in turn, feeds into the work of the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs. We will, of course, be happy to keep the House advised of progress in the work of the conference.</P>
      <P>At a time of major change both within the Union and in the wider international arena, Ireland's priority objectives for the Intergovernmental Conference will be to ensure that the Union is equipped to function effectively in the context of enlargement and to make certain that the delicate institutional balance which lies at the heart of the Union is maintained in any new arrangements.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>As a smaller member state, Ireland has a particular interest in ensuring that these balances, including those between large and small member states, which contribute to the unique character of the Union are maintained for the future. In this regard, we have made clear that the proper <Col N="1087" /> functioning of the Union requires that each member state retains the right to nominate a commissioner. We believe this is desirable not only from a national perspective but because it serves to reinforce the authority and credibility of the Commission across the Union. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made our position in this regard very clear at the ministerial meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels earlier this week.</P>
    <P>As regards a review of the weighting of votes in the Council, we note that this has been linked to the suggestion that larger member states would be willing to forgo their second commissioner. We will carefully consider any specific proposals which might be put forward under this heading to ensure that they indeed contribute to the effective functioning of the Union while maintaining the necessary institutional balance. However, any change would have to be conditional on the willingness of the larger member states to give up their second commissioner and by assurances regarding the right of each member state to nominate a commissioner.</P>
    <P>With regard to qualified majority voting, it is, of course, the case that QMV already applies to a very significant part of the Council's work. Our experience to date has been that the operation of qualified majority voting has been generally helpful to Irish interests, for example, in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy and the completion of the Single Market, and has facilitated the adoption of measures which were beneficial from an Irish perspective. It will also be recalled that at Amsterdam, Ireland, together with a significant majority of member states, was prepared to consider extending QMV to some additional areas but, in the end, agreement did not prove possible. Our approach to proposals to extend the scope of QMV will be to examine each area on a case-by-case basis with a view to assessing whether a move to QMV would serve our interests and those of the Union. Bearing in mind that in a number of sensitive areas the case for retaining the present unanimity provisions remains overwhelming, we will also, of course, be conscious that on occasions unanimity can serve to prevent adoption of decisions to which we attach importance.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the commitment to work closely with the institutions, it was agreed at Helsinki that the European Parliament would be invited to designate two of its members to participate in the preparatory group and that each meeting at ministerial level would be preceded by an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament. These arrangements, which go beyond those in place for previous Intergovernmental Conferences, are working well. The meetings with the President of the Parliament, Madame Fontaine, and her colleagues, have helped to ensure that both Ministers and the Parliament are aware of the others' views. In this context, while careful attention will be paid to the position of the Parliament on the substantive issues, it is fair <Col N="1088" /> to say that we would not share the Parliament's view that the Intergovernmental Conference agenda should be considerably expanded beyond that agreed by the Helsinki European Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland is determined to contribute constructively to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. We have a vital interest in its success and in ensuring that an enlarged Union, in which due account is taken of the necessary balances, is in a position to play its part in the rapidly changing global environment.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister did not have an opportunity to continue as we were just about to get to the meat of the reply. Perhaps, when replying to my supplementary question, she might conclude her reply. Will she indicate what arrangements she intends to make to keep the Dáil advised of the issues as they evolve and to allow it, either in the House or in committee, to debate those issues in order that the Government would be informed of Members' views? </P>

      <P>I understand the Minister is very willing to keep the House advised of progress in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. It is important that I outline the key issues with which we are concerned in the context of completing the Intergovernmental Conference agenda. As I stated earlier, our main objective will be to ensure that the Union is equipped to function effectively in the context of enlargement and to make certain that the delicate institutional balance which lies at the heart of the Union is maintained in any new arrangements. As a smaller member state, Ireland has a particular interest in ensuring that these balances, including between large and small member states, which contribute to the unique character of the Union are maintained for the future.</P>
      <P>We have made clear that the proper functioning of the Union requires that each member state retains the right to nominate a Commissioner. We believe this is desirable not only from a national perspective, but because it serves to reinforce the authority and credibility of the Commission across the Union. Our position in this regard has been made clear.</P>
      <P>As regards the weighting of votes in the Council, this has been linked with the suggestion that larger member states would be willing to forego their second Commissioner. We will carefully consider any specific proposals which might be put forward under this heading to ensure that they contribute to the effective functioning of the Union while maintaining the necessary institutional balance. Any change would have to be conditional on the willingness of the larger member states to give up their second Commissioner and by assurances regarding the right of each member state to nominate a Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, the case that QMV already applies to a very significant part of the Council's work. Our experience to date has been that the <Col N="1089" /> operation of QMV has been generally helpful to Irish interests, for example, in the context of the CAP and the completion of the Single Market, and has facilitated the adoption of measures which were beneficial from an Irish perspective. It will also be recalled that in Amsterdam, Ireland, along with a significant majority of member states, was prepared to consider extending QMV to some additional areas, but agreement did not prove possible in the end. Our approach to proposals to extend QMV will be to examine each area on a case by case basis with a view to assessing whether a move to QMV would serve our interests and those of the Union. Bearing in mind that, in a number of sensitive areas, the case for retaining the present unanimity provisions remains overwhelming, we are conscious that, on occasions, unanimity can serve to prevent adoption of decisions to which we attach importance. These issues are of major interest to the Irish Parliament and it is important that we continue to report progress in respect of them.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the commitment to work closely with the institutions, it was agreed at Helsinki that the European Parliament would be invited to designate two of its members to participate in the preparatory group and that each meeting at ministerial level would be preceded by an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament. These arrangements, which go beyond those in place for previous intergovernmental conferences, are working well. The meetings with the President of the Parliament, Madame Fontaine, and her colleagues have helped ensure that both Ministers and the Parliament are aware of the others views. In this context, while careful attention will be paid to the position of the Parliament on the substantive issues, we would not share the Parliament's view that the Intergovernmental Conference agenda should be considerably expanded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The theme for the special European Council is &ldquo;Employment, economic reforms and social cohesion &ndash; for a Europe of innovation <Col N="1090" /> and knowledge&rdquo;. While the primary focus for the Heads of State and Government at Lisbon will be on this core theme it is expected that there will also be discussions on a number of foreign policy issues.</P>
      <P>The Portuguese Presidency has proposed a new strategic goal for the European Union &ldquo;to make the European Union the world's most dynamic and competitive area, based on innovation and knowledge, able to boost economic growth levels, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion&rdquo;. This involves a creative response to the new opportunities and challenges posed by the transition to an innovation and knowledge based society and improved co-ordination among EU member states, particularly in the areas of macro-economic policies, economic reform and structural policies, active employment policies and the modernisation of social protection.</P>
      <P>The Lisbon summit will provide us with the opportunity to develop our vision of Europe of innovation and knowledge and to focus on the issue of competitiveness, which is fundamental to achieving the goals of employment, economic growth and social cohesion. The recent Irish experience validates a number of the key issues to be discussed at Lisbon, including, in particular, the most recent national agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, in which the Government and the social partners have identified lifelong learning and successful adaptation to the information society as priority challenges in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The Irish perspective for Lisbon and the priority areas we have identified for attention at Lisbon have been clearly outlined in our national paper which was circulated earlier this month. In terms of the contribution of Ireland to the preparations of the Lisbon summit, we suggested that the following should feature among the priority areas for attention.</P>
      <P>First, lifelong learning, education and training: improving knowledge and skills on a continuous basis so as to respond successfully to rapid technological and structural change; facilitating social inclusion and the fullest possible participation in economic and social life; and promoting mutual recognition of qualifications.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Second, the economic and social environment: economic and social reform including structural reform, completion of the Single Market, enterprise development, tackling social exclusion and addressing the challenge of changing demographics; we support the Presidency objective of greater economic co-ordination and we attach importance to the promulgation of a charter for small firms which would accord due recognition to, and boost confidence in, this priority sector; social inclusion should be an integral part of EU economic and social policy and macro-economic policies should incorporate the goals of employment growth and poverty reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, IT access: deregulation and increasing <Col N="1091" /> competition in the telecommunications sector to achieve low cost connectivity to the global broadband telecommunications network and to provide public Internet access points &ndash; ICTs have an important role to play and all pupils should have access to facilities in line with their educational needs.</P>
    <P>Fourth, research and development: making the appropriate interventions to stimulate economic activity from research and development investment and greater co-operation among members states.</P>
    <P>Fifth, benchmarking: taking a measured but ambitious approach to the sharing of good practice among EU member states and the setting of targets within a framework of peer review as proposed by the Presidency.</P>
    <P>In addition to our national contribution, we have also been engaged in contacts with British officials to establish a joint approach at Lisbon and we have reached agreement on a joint British-Irish statement. The text of the joint statement builds on elements from our national paper and highlights three broad areas where the UK and Ireland will seek to ensure concrete progress at Lisbon &ndash; education and lifelong learning, innovation and enterprise and fighting social exclusion.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State indicated that social cohesion is on the agenda in Lisbon. I wish it was also on the agenda in Dublin. A study published in France this week shows that in the past two years there has been a marked increase in anti-immigrant feeling with 70% stating that they find the presence of foreigners in France aggravating. The largest increases were in anti-Arab feeling which has risen by 12% and anti-black feeling which has risen by 8%. There has also been an increase in anti-Semitism which has risen by 7%.</P>

In accordance with normal practice, the Taoiseach and the Minister will be making a statement to the Dáil in due course on the outcome of the European Council. There is a clear agenda or theme for this summit. That theme is appropriate for consideration by the Government and the nation, particularly given the stage we have reached in our economic development. As already stated, our priorities were set out in our national paper. Other issues may be raised at the Council and it will fall to the Minister or the Taoiseach to inform the House in that regard following the conclusion of the summit.</P>

      <P>With the receding of the flood waters, I am pleased to report that the humanitarian situation in Mozambique is beginning to stabilise. Rescue operations are winding up and the emphasis is now on providing emergency relief to the displaced and affected population. While there are still reports coming in of isolated groups of people who have been cut off from the outside world due to inundated roads, the relief operation is now geared to respond quickly. Currently 463,000 people, including the displaced and those who have been isolated, are receiving food aid.</P>
      <P>Airlifts of food and other emergency items are arriving daily. While some non-governmental organisations experienced problems initially with unloading relief supplies, due to landing fees being charged at the airport in Beira, all fees for flights carrying goods for humanitarian assistance have now been lifted. The humanitarian response to the Mozambique disaster has been enormous. There has been an unprecedented response by western countries, including Ireland, and by those in the southern African region. On 23 February the UN launched an initial appeal for $13.5 million. By now over $118 million has been received. The additional money will be used to fund a programme being put together by the UN which will target reconstruction work over the next six months.</P>
      <P>The UN, through its Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, has been co-ordinating the international relief effort. OCHA sent in two UN disaster assessment and co-ordination teams to assess the needs and help co-ordinate a unified response from the many aid agencies and donors operating in the region thus ensuring that all needs are being addressed. The UN is best placed to take on the role of co-ordination having committed staff, specialist knowledge and a capacity to interact with Governments at the highest levels which cannot be matched by NGOs or bilateral Governments.</P>
      <P>Ireland has made available a total of £2,365,000 in response to this crisis. This money has come from both our emergency humanitarian budget and our country programme budget in Mozambique. Some £700,000 has been allocated from the emergency budget and has gone to both UN agencies and the Irish NGOs, Concern and GOAL, which are working in the region.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Mozambique has been a priority country for <Col N="1094" /> Irish Government development aid since 1996. The budget allocation this year is £7.4 million. From this point on, programme expenditure will be administered with maximum flexibility to help Mozambique to deal with the consequences of the emergency. Ireland Aid is ready to provide further funding in response to emerging needs. Already £1 million has been reallocated to be used for reconstruction and recovery activities. A further £650,000 which has been reallocated from a health sector support programme is being used for the purchase of emergency medicines and vaccines to prevent the spread of cholera and other water-borne diseases. The fact that we have a presence on the ground has enabled us to react quickly to the situation. In the aftermath of the first floods the Irish Embassy took the initiative in conducting the first aerial survey of the province of Inhambane, where we operate an area programme. Embassy staff were accompanied by the Provincial Governor of Inhambane on this survey.</P>
    <P>As the flood waters recede and the affected people are beginning to return to their communities, we must now begin to focus our support on recovery actions which will be run in parallel with the continuing relief effort. It is essential that the recovery process is seized as an opportunity to reduce the long-term vulnerability of Mozambique. Part of the reason that Mozambique suffered such devastating effects as a result of the floods is linked to poverty and the difficulties faced by vulnerable social groups in absorbing the impact of the floods and recovering from them. The focus of Ireland's development programme is on long-term development and building capacity aimed at reducing such poverty.</P>
    <P>Reducing vulnerability will also be the focus of the donor co-ordination meeting being convened in Rome on 27 and 28 April, at which Ireland will be represented. A framework for sustainable recovery and vulnerability reduction in Mozambique has been prepared by the United Nations development programme and will be presented at the meeting. Funding to increase Mozambique's disaster preparedness capacity will be essential.</P>
    <P>Of course, the heavy external debt repayments that Mozambique has had to cope with in the past have posed a serious constraint on development. The Irish Government has been vocal in calling for accelerated debt relief for Mozambique. We have said there is a compelling case for the cancellation of all Mozambique's external debt. I, therefore, welcome the recent announcements by France and Italy to cancel Mozambique's debt to them. The decision by the Paris Club of bilateral creditor nations to defer Mozambique's debts service payments to the group until much of the debt is cancelled later this year is a welcome response to the recent disaster. We would encourage other bilateral donors to take similar actions.</P>
    <P>Another serious issue is the danger posed by landmines. There is concern that the floods have caused landmines to be displaced and previously demined areas may now be unsafe. As much of <Col N="1095" /> the country is still under water it is difficult at this time to quantify the extent of the problem. Nevertheless, the United Nations Mine Action Service has begun a public awareness campaign on the dangers posed by displacement of mines. As the waters recede they will also begin an assessment of the situation. Mozambique has been a priority for Ireland Aid funding for demining in the past. We will continue to support demining efforts and awareness campaigns in the country in light of the additional problems posed by the floods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the suspension of debt repayment by Mozambique is not sufficient and that its elimination is necessary? Does she agree that Ireland would be in a better position to call for this elimination if we met our 0.7% GNP contribution, as outlined by the UN, towards development aid? Will the Minister of State tell us her intentions regarding meeting the 0.7% target, as the Taoiseach, speaking at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, merely repeated what has been said previously?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a compelling case for the total cancellation of Mozambique's debt. Important progress has been made in alleviating its debt burden. It qualified for relief under the original HIPC initiative, through which it is receiving $3.7 billion in debt service relief. It is expected to qualify for more than $500 million in additional debt service relief under the enhanced framework. We welcome the recent decisions by France and Italy to cancel debts amounting to almost $900 million owed by Mozambique. Ireland will encourage other bilateral donors to take similar action. The Government also welcomes the decision by the Paris Club of bilateral creditor nations to allow Mozambique to defer its debt service repayments to the group until much of the debt is cancelled later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is separate from the debt question. As the Deputy knows, the Government set an interim target of 0.45% of GNP to be met by 2002. As I have admitted to the House, we were thrown off course, not because of our growth which is no excuse, but because of a change in the calculation of our GNP which has caused us to slide by about four points. We are engaged in a comprehensive review of the aid programme and I will shortly bring proposals to Cabinet which will guarantee an incremental multi-annual budgetary allocation with a view to reaching a target. We are working towards a target and I believe we will reach the target announced by the Taoiseach by 2007. However, we should also have an interim target because it is not fair for this Government to commit future Governments, of which we may not be part&mdash;</P>

We are aiming for a target of 0.5% by 2005. That will involve substantial cash increases which will need management. We are working on this at the moment. With a rapidly growing programme, proper consideration needs to be given to how we will spend that money and whether in terms of the overall ODA, we commit more money to be channelled through NGOs, of which I am in favour. All these matters are being discussed and proposals will be brought to Cabinet.</P>

      <P>As chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, Ireland has been following closely developments in relation to Chechnya. This issue has been the highest priority of the Irish chairmanship of the Council of Europe since we took over the office in November last. It has been actively discussed at every meeting of the Committee of Ministers since then.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, Mr. Gil-Robles, made a number of visits to Moscow and the region. The Secretary General of the Council, Mr. Schwimmer, invoked Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights and requested detailed information from Russia on Chechnya. The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, visited Moscow in January this year to press Russia to take action to end the conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Council of Europe Human Rights Conference in Dublin, organised by the Irish chairmanship, on 3 and 4 March, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, stressed the Government's profound concern at the mounting reports of serious human rights abuses in Chechnya. He strongly urged Russia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation into reports of civilian killings and human rights abuses and to bring those responsible to justice. There was a high level Russian presence at the conference and the Minister met <Col N="1097" /> with Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gusarov, to ensure that the Government's concerns would be conveyed clearly and emphatically to the Russian authorities. At the conference the Minister also had detailed discussions with both the Secretary General of the Council and the Human Rights Commissioner on the role which the Council can play to restore the rule of law and respect for human rights and democracy in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>A Council of Europe parliamentary delegation led by Lord Judd recently visited the region. It is clear from its preliminary report that the delegation considers serious human rights violations to have taken place in Chechnya on both sides. The delegation will report to the Parliamentary Assembly on its findings and the assembly will debate the issue at its next part-session in Strasbourg in early April. In the light of this report and the clear indications that the mood of the Parliamentary Assembly is currently hardening towards a recommendation for suspension of the Russian Federation from membership of the Council of Europe, the Minister wrote last week to Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov bringing these indications to his attention and urging on him the need for Russia to respond positively to the concerns which were expressed.</P>

      <i>Additional Information</i>

    <P>
      <i>
      </i>At present, efforts are focused on the proposal which has been made by the Parliamentary Assembly in its Recommendation 1444 for a Council of Europe presence in the North Caucasus. The modalities for this presence have been agreed <i>ad referendum</i> in discussions in Strasbourg with the recently appointed Russian Special Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya, Mr. Kalamanov. In addition, work is proceeding on two Council of Europe conferences to be held in the region. The first, to be held in April will consider federal relations within a democratic state and the second, in May, will work on the building of democratic institutions in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>The Chechen conflict has also been to the forefront of the agendas of other international organisations and there has been close co-operation by them with the Council of Europe. A meeting between the Council of Europe and the EU was held in Strasbourg on 14 March and a meeting between the Council of Europe and the OSCE will take place in Vienna on 12 April. The EU has applied a number of measures to Russia because of Chechnya. These include reducing planned activities under the EU Common Strategy on Russia, stricter enforcement of trade agreements and slowing down the EU's aid programme for Russia. The question of additional measures against Russia is being kept under review. The issue of Chechnya will be one of the principal items on the agenda for discussions by Heads of State and Government at the Lisbon European Council on 23 and 24 March.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> The OSCE has put monitors on the Chechen border with Georgia and continues to press for the reinstatement of the OSCE assistance mission in Grozny. The United Nations has also been working to promote peace. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan visited Russia for talks with Acting President Putin and the UN Commissioner on Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, is to visit the region on 1 and 2 April. Mrs. Robinson has indicated that she intends to put the issue of Chechnya on the agenda of this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which opened in Geneva on 20 March.</P>
    <P>At the centre of all our concerns are the innocent civilians who have been caught up in this conflict. Ireland has allocated £310,000 in humanitarian assistance to Chechen internally displaced persons, to augment Ireland's share of the European Union aid package of £7.4 million. We will continue to do everything possible to ensure that fundamental humanitarian assistance is provided effectively to those in need. The conflict in Chechnya must be brought to a peaceful conclusion, the vulnerable population must be given adequate humanitarian assistance, reported human rights abuses must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. The Government is committed to these goals and will continue to work actively in their pursuit both as Chair of the Council of Europe and in other appropriate fora.</P>

      <P>The Russian Government is clearly guilty of human rights abuses. The Minister said both sides were guilty but only one side, the Russian state, is a member of the Council of Europe. How would the Minister of State contrast the treatment of Russia by the Council of Europe with the treatment of Austria by the European Union?</P>

      <P>The treatment of Austria by the European Union is a separate question which I will leave Austria to answer. The Council of Europe, with Ireland as its chair, has been active in raising the issue of human rights abuses in Chechnya. If significant and substantial progress is not made by Russia on the relevant issues and the Parliamentary Assembly recommends suspension, which is possible, the Committee of Ministers will have to give that its full and careful consideration. It will have to weigh carefully the need to protect and maintain Council of Europe standards against the undesirability of isolating Russia. These political calls will have to be made by the Ministers, with all they imply for the continuation of the reform process in Russia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee will also have to ask itself whether a decision to suspend Russia would help the people at the heart of our concern, that is, the innocent civilians caught up in this conflict, or would they be better served by continuing the efforts to keep Russia engaged with the council. Each member of the Council of Europe, including <Col N="1099" /> Ireland, will have to weigh these issues carefully. As chairman of the committee, Ireland must to ensure there is a clear and considered debate on this important question.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to pre-empt the next question on Austria but would the Minister agree that the international community, led by larger states, has set a woeful precedent in the way it has treated Austria on the one hand and a large state like Russia on the other? Is that not a woeful precedent for the treatment of smaller member states at the behest of larger states to suit their internal interests? Why was action not taken against Russia long before now?</P>

      <P>I have outlined the steps taken by the Council of Europe in relation to Chechnya. There have been active and considered attempts to highlight and take issue with the Russian authorities about the human rights abuses in that war. How the European Union would deal with another member state as compared with how it would deal with a country which is not a member of the EU is a different question. They are different political contexts and they require different responses. It is illogical to expect the European Union to deal with Russian foreign affairs in a similar way to how it would deal with another member of the European Union or to expect that there would be similar criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I welcomed the resignation of the Governor of Carinthia from his position as leader of the Freedom Party as an effort to respond to international criticisms of the inclusion of the Freedom Party in the new Austrian Government. The Austrian Government will be judged on its policies, declarations and actions, and whatever reassurance these will provide will be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the measures of the 14 as outlined in the statement issued by the Portuguese Presidency on 31 January still apply. The 14 do not promote or accept any ministerial contacts with a government which includes the Freedom Party, there is no support for Austrian candidates <Col N="1100" /> seeking positions in international organisations and Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals are received at official but not ministerial level.</P>
    <P>The Portuguese Presidency of the EU has agreed to a request from Austrian Federal Chancellor, Wolfgang Schussel, that the matter be raised in the European Council taking place in Lisbon today. While I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of that discussion, the Heads of State and Government will take into account the recent developments in Austria, including the resignation of the Governor of Carinthia from his position as leader of the Freedom Party.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to point out that the measures of the 14 have not touched on the conduct of EU business, the standing of Austria as a member state of the European Union or as a member of other international organisations. On 12 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his capacity as chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, will travel to Vienna to meet his Austrian colleague, Dr. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, in her capacity as chairman in office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to discuss issues of interest to both organisations. Meetings such as these continue as before and are not affected by the measures of the 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is inaccurate to say European Union business is not affected by the treatment of Austria? Is it not a fact that, since taking office, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has entertained all the ambassadors accredited to this country, including the Russian ambassador whose troops are running riot in Chechnya, and that the Austrian ambassador who has not offended anybody and is representing his duly elected government has been treated shabbily? Will she join me in calling for an end to the boycott of the representative of the Austrian Government as the best method of ensuring that the type of extremism put forward by the leader of the Freedom Party will not gain root in Austria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the parallel the Deputy is trying to make between the situation in Chechnya and the treatment by the Presidency of the European Union of another member state, in this case Austria. The Government's view is that the measures represent a balanced approach. Some EU partners with particular historical experiences understandably feel strongly about this matter. The nature of the Freedom Party poses a fundamental problem which we cannot ignore. However, the measures of the 14 have not touched on the conduct of EU business or on the standing of Austria as a member state of the European Union or of any other international organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to a request from Chancellor Schussel that the matter be raised at the European Council taking place in Lisbon today. It is important to recall that the EU <Col N="1101" /> is a community of values which seeks to develop observation of and respect for those values of democratic pluralism, human rights and tolerance of diversity that are the foundation stones upon which the EU was built.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a more apt comparison with the situation in Russia and Chechnya is that of Serbia and Kosovo? Where we are acting hypocritically is by taking one position in relation to Kosovo and another in relation to Chechnya. It does not matter how many leaders of the Freedom Party resign. It is the policy and politics the party puts forward which are at issue and the fact that these are now represented within the Austrian Government.</P>
      <P>Has the Irish Government been asked to meet any Austrian Ministers since the statement of the 14 and have those requests, if any, been refused?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be fairer to compare the response of the international community to human rights abuses in Chechnya with its response to human rights abuses in Kosovo. Unfortunately, that is the way world politics have developed. However, we are most concerned about the human rights abuses in Chechnya. Notwithstanding everybody's respect for sovereignty and the fact that the Russians are fighting a war against an Islamic fundamentalist movement, the atrocities against civilians are unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I am not aware if there has been a request for an Irish Minister to meet an Austrian Minister. It is true that the Austrian ambassador has not been received except at official level in the Department. The reaction of the 14 member states was, overall, a measured one which acknowledged our commitment to fundamental values and norms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My stated views on the Freedom Party equate with those of the Minister and Deputy De Rossa. However, I have a serious concern about the precedent set and the manner in which this decision was taken outside the institutions of the European Union under the leadership of some member states who were looking after their own interests. It is a woeful precedent which could backfire badly on this State in the future. Imagine if Sinn Féin was invited to participate in our Government and another member state took exception to that, based on its own interests. This is a woeful precedent. Will the Minister join me in seeking an end to this boycott of the Austrian Government and its representative here and in finding other ways to persuade the people of Austria not to support the extremism of the Freedom Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters will be watched closely by each of the member states, including Ireland. As of now, the Government stands full square with the 14 others on this matter and on <Col N="1102" /> the measures which were agreed against Austria. That will be its position until there is a change in that policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government is very seized of the growth of racist tendencies in Ireland. With our EU partners we are very conscious that positive programmes need to be implemented in the media, schools and the rest of society. Public figures should use every opportunity to denounce the growth of xenophobic tendencies. That is the way to discourage people from forming political parties which would have a mandate in that regard. Comprehensive proposals on integration policies will shortly be submitted to the Cabinet. These include an extension of existing anti-racist programmes which have been developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Departments. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has taken steps to raise awareness of issues of racism through its service providers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The end of the Cold War provided a unique opportunity for progress in the field of nuclear disarmament. The extension of the non-proliferation treaty in 1995 renewed the prospects for the early achievement of the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons, as called for by Article VI of the treaty. In spite of recent unilateral steps taken by some nuclear weapons states to lessen the role of nuclear weapons in their defence strategies, the promise of incremental nuclear disarmament, witnessed in the early 1990s, has not been realised and the process has stalled. In the interim the retention of nuclear <Col N="1103" /> weapons has again been rationalised long after the causes that originally gave rise to their development had disappeared.</P>
      <P>The nuclear testing by India and Pakistan in 1998 and the continuing failure of India, Israel and Pakistan to adhere to the non-proliferation treaty must be seen as serious additional threats to the achievement of nuclear disarmament. It was in this context that Ireland, together with Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden launched the initiative Towards a Nuclear Weapons Free World: The Need for a New Agenda in 1998. The purpose of this initiative, which currently numbers over 60 co-sponsoring countries at the UN, is to secure a more committed and rapid process leading to the early elimination of nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>In line with Ireland's unique role in proposing the non-proliferation treaty and its promotion over the 30 years of its existence, the Government continues to pursue the goal of early elimination of nuclear weapons wherever we are represented, especially at the UN, the conference on disarmament and the review conference of the NPT. We will contribute actively to the forthcoming review conference of the parties to the non-proliferation treaty in April. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will lead the Irish delegation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the steps taken by the Government on this issue at international and UN level. With Deputy Mitchell, I would be happier if it also took the matter up in the EU because the question of a common foreign and security defence is currently being debated in the EU. Has the Government put forward views on the current status of nuclear deterrence and first <Col N="1104" /> strike, which NATO, for instance, retains? Given the views expressed by the Taoiseach last night that a common defence by the EU would simply replicate NATO, should that give rise to questions about our attitude to nuclear deterrence in the European context?</P>

The Petersberg Tasks as defined in the Amsterdam Treaty are humanitarian, rescue, peace-keeping and crisis management tasks. All 15 member states, including countries which share our commitment to nuclear disarmament, are active members in the SDP debate. Contrary to misleading newspaper reports, there is no question of the Army being forced to fight countries with nuclear weapons in an EU role. I am sorry if that is not a comprehensive reply, but I have no information before me on whether nuclear disarmament has been raised at the EU. If it has been raised I am sure the Minister will deal with it.</P>

      <P>The Government is aware of reports of the ill-treatment of prisoners in Turkmenistan. One prisoner has died in custody under suspicious circumstances and others have claimed they were tortured during detention. The situation of human rights in this country, including the treatment of prisoners, is a matter of serious concern. Turkmenistan is a central Asian republic and is not a member of the Council of Europe. However, the Government is following the issue closely, together with partners in the European Union and within the OSCE.</P>
      <P>The European Union has raised a number of individual human rights cases with the Government of Turkmenistan. The EU has made clear that it expects Turkmenistan, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement signed in May 1998, to show that it shares common values such as respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. The EU has indicated in direct contact with the Turkmen authorities, that ratification of the PCA, which to date has been completed by only four EU member states, is likely to remain suspended in the absence of concrete measures to deal with human rights concerns.</P>
      <P>The situation of human rights in Turkmenistan is also a serious preoccupation of the OSCE, especially the OSCE centre in Ashgabad which was established in January 1999. However, Turkmenistan is the only country of central Asia which has not signed a memorandum of understanding between the Government and the OSCE Office for Democratic Infrastructure and Human Rights. This would allow for substantial assistance to be provided by the Ashgabad centre in the field of democratisation, rule of law and human rights. The centre continues to make strenuous efforts to promote fundamental reform, but progress remains slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government strongly supported the OSCE decision to open an office in each of the central Asian republics with a view to assisting the <Col N="1106" /> reform process in the region. Last year the Government provided a mini-projects grant from Irish aid of £55,000 to be divided between the five OSCE field offices. This provided £11,000 to the centre in Ashgabad to be spent at the discretion of the head of mission on small, practical projects designed to promote human rights in the country. A report on the use of the funds is expected from the OSCE shortly. The Government will continue to work for the improvement of human rights in Turkmenistan, including the treatment of prisoners. In this regard, it will continue to liaise closely with the OSCE centre and with European Union partners.</P>

      <P>This country is one of five central Asian republics which were once part of the USSR and it borders Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. At the 90th meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe held in Strasbourg in 1992, Ministers declared the readiness of the Council of Europe to establish appropriate contacts with the republics of central Asia if they so requested.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the parliamentary assembly recommended that states whose national territory lay wholly or partly in Europe and whose culture was closely linked with the European culture should be eligible for membership of the Council of Europe. On this basis, the former Soviet Republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were to be considered eligible provided they clearly indicated their will to be part of Europe. Under the terms of that recommendation, Turkmenistan is not eligible to become a member state of the Council of Europe. However, the parliamentary assembly recommendation also opened the way for suitable co-operation with neighbouring states. In this context, Turkmenistan has participated in a number of the Council's activities, notably those concerned with biological and landscape diversity strategies.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture was established as a monitoring arm of the 1987 European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The convention provides non-judicial preventative machinery in this regard. Human rights is a priority of the Government and we will do everything we can with the international community to pursue legitimate human rights concerns in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 61 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The heavy external debt of developing countries imposes a serious constraint on the development of the 41 heavily indebted poor countries or HIPCs. The high level of debt repayments required of these countries diverts scarce resources from key sectors such as health and education. Many of them also have to deal with very high rates of HIV/AIDS infection. For its part, Ireland has consistently advocated a generous and flexible international response to the debt crisis.</P>
      <P>The World Bank/IMF at its annual meeting at the end of September 1999 agreed on extensive revisions to the original 1996 HIPC initiative on debt relief under which only three countries qualified for relief. These reforms ease the conditions under which debt relief is granted. They strengthen the relationship between debt relief and poverty alleviation. In this respect, the enhanced HIPC reflects one of the central points raised in Ireland's national submission to the HIPC review, that is, that the resources freed by debt relief should be of direct benefit to those in the greatest need.</P>
      <P>Under the enhanced HIPC initiative, debt repayments by countries which have undertaken economic reforms should fall to a level which is sustainable and which does not deflect scarce resources from important social sectors such as health and education. By the end of 2000 almost 30 of the 41 HIPC countries should have qualified for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC.</P>
      <P>Ireland, which was critical of the original HIPC initiative, sees the enhanced HIPC as a significant advance on its predecessor and an important step towards tackling debt. We welcomed the decision taken on 8 December 1999 that the EU should contribute 1 billion to debt relief and the HIPC initiative. Our share of this will be 6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the extent of public support for the Jubilee 2000 campaign which is calling for total debt cancellation. The campaign has played an important role in galvanising the international community. The current debt relief provisions applied by the IMF and the <Col N="1108" /> World Bank are, in part, a response to the campaign's activities.</P>
    <P>Total cancellation of debt for all 41 HIPC countries raises a number of difficult and complex questions. Issues such as corruption, poor governance, internal conflict and human rights abuses must also be taken into account. The funding of total debt cancellation would also be a major problem. It is natural that creditor governments, who will be expected to pay very substantial money in support of debt relief, will want assurances that resources are directed to the alleviation of poverty and not diverted into other areas, such as warfare.</P>
    <P>In addition, total debt cancellation would raise uncertainties about the ability of countries concerned to borrow funds internationally in the future. Creditors are inevitably cautious about lending to countries which, in the past, have not been able to repay debts. A number of countries such as South Africa, which wishes to be able to borrow in the future, would not advocate total cancellation of debt.</P>
    <P>In the case of Mozambique, we have argued that there is a compelling case for total debt cancellation. Mozambique has shown strong commitment to democracy and economic reform during the 1990s. It had qualified for debt relief under the original HIPC and should receive additional relief under the enhanced HIPC. Mozambique has now suffered a devastating blow to its development prospects. Yet, even with the application of debt relief, it must still pay US$1.5 million per week in debt repayments. France and Italy have promised to cancel Mozambique's remaining debts to them and we encourage other bilateral donors to take similar actions. The Paris Club of bilateral creditor nations decided on 15 March to allow Mozambique to defer its debt service payments to the group until additional relief is provided this year under the enhanced HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>Ireland strongly welcomes measures, whether through debt relief or debt cancellation, aimed at easing the burden. We have contributed £31 million to relieve the debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries. We have allocated £9.5 million to debt relief in Tanzania and Mozambique, both of which are priority countries for us. Funds amounting to £22 million are being channelled through the World Bank and the IMF to finance the debt initiative. Ireland will continue to use its influence to press for a just and comprehensive long-term solution to the debt problem in the developing world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened intently to what the Minister of State said. On the one hand she outlined what is being done but, on the other, she mentioned the difficulty total debt cancellation can create. My question asked what measures would have to be put in place to cancel Third World debt, something she did not outline, and I also asked what steps, if any, Ireland can take to initiate cancellation of the debt. If we examined <Col N="1109" /> the benefits that could accrue from cancellation, we would have to initiate it and then see what the strong arm of some of the financial institutions would say about it. I ask the Minister to outline what we can do in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined in my reply the comprehensive nature of this problem and the fact there has been an enhanced HIPC initiative which is an advance on the previous one of which we were critical. In our contacts in the EU and at the World Bank we have supported the need for greater and more urgent action. We have advocated the most generous possible EU support for HIPC. We, therefore, welcomed the decision taken on 8 December 1999 that the EU should contribute 1 billion to debt relief, that the HIPC initiative would place the EU in the lead role internationally in dealing with the issue and that Ireland's share would be in the region of 6 million.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with the first HIPC initiative was that it placed stringent demands on poor countries in terms of their structural and economic reforms. Some relaxation of those rules have now been introduced. This is a more flexible approach to the heavily indebted poor countries.</P>
      <P>Mozambique is an example of a country which is suitable for debt alleviation. It benefited substantially from the HIPC initiative and bilateral assistance from Ireland and other donor countries for its debt service repayments before the flooding. However, even if its debt is reduced to sustainable levels, it would not be able to recover from its current difficulties if it must continue paying the debt. It is a complex issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware that the global epicentre of the AIDS epidemic is sub-Saharan Africa. Statistics indicate that in 1999, 23.3 million men, women and children in sub-Saharan Africa had AIDS or were HIV positive. This figure represents almost 70% of the world's total infections in a region that is home to only 10% of the world's population. According to UN aids, eastern and southern Africa are home to 4.8% of the world's population, yet it has more than 50% of the world's population who are HIV positive and accounts for 60% of all lives claimed by AIDS since the epidemic's inception.</P>
      <P>It is terrible that we are watching this holocaust while at the same time expecting the people who are suffering to spend money on servicing debt rather than on health issues. Does the Minister of State agree that it would be a service to humanity if we sought to establish a European Union commission on debt forgiveness on a regional basis? This might give leadership to other regions throughout the world. Will the Minister of State consider the possibility of establishing such a body which would be representative of the 15 member states? </P>

      <P>I agree there is a need for urgency and for people to focus on this issue, particularly in the context of the pandemic of AIDS which has reversed much of the development achieved in these poor countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Following the Taoiseach's visit to Lesotho and South Africa, he was interested in pursuing a line with our European Union partners. He has formally taken an initiative with the Commission. The Department of Foreign Affairs has completed a programme which ensures that attention to and the treatment of AIDS is now part of all our development programmes in our priority countries. There will be further moves by the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs to highlight the pandemic of AIDS.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said that only three of the heavily indebted countries qualified under the original HIPC initiative and that the number is now 31 out of a possible 41. Given that these are the most heavily indebted countries, why do ten not qualify? What mechanisms are in place to measure the impact of debt relief? If there is no impact in terms of improved water supplies and education and health systems, we must examine what we are doing and how we are operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important for those of us who are proponents of debt relief, the HIPC initiative and other instruments of the World Bank to know to what extent they make a difference. I do not know the reason those ten countries have not yet qualified. I presume it is because of the strict criteria &ndash; even when the criteria are relaxed these countries are still not eligible &ndash; or it could be bad governance or because these countries may not be democracies. I will find out why each of the ten countries are not eligible.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important if the debt relief initiatives are to continue and be supported that any money saved by these countries should be ploughed into eliminating poverty and not used to pay debt service repayments. It is important that these Governments are not allowed to get away with not paying their debts while using the money on armaments or other measures which would not directly alleviate the suffering of their people. Our focus in Ireland Aid is always on the reduction and elimination of poverty. Our focus in debt alleviation should be to reduce poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 68, 88 and 167 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> The Government is concerned at the situation in East Timor. The humanitarian situation remains difficult and efforts to establish the institutions of government, rebuild the economy and promote reconciliation are being undermined by a resurgence of militia activity.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 1272, East Timor is now being administered by the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor, UNTAET, established on 25 October 1999. The assumption by UNTAET of all of its functions took place in late February when the earlier peacekeeping force, INTERFET, came to an end, and its assets and personnel, including the Irish contribution, were transferred to UNTAET. UNTAET has a broad mandate to support the transition of East Timor to independence. Its mission is to provide security and to maintain law and order, to establish an administration as well as the capacity for self-government and to help develop civil and social services. It is also tasked with co-ordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid, reconstruction and the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sergio de Mello, head of UNTAET, has established a national consultative council on which the different strands of East Timorese political opinion and the Church are represented. While it is not possible to determine precisely how long will be needed for UNTAET to achieve its goals, most estimates are for two or possibly three years, given the size and range of the tasks remaining.</P>
    <P>Among the problems to be addressed by UNTAET are the continuing threats from the militias and the obstacles being placed in the way of refugees in West Timor who wish to return. These issues were brought to the attention of the Taoiseach during his visit to East Timor on 9 March, and, in view of their very serious nature, he has raised these concerns with President Wahid of Indonesia, the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright, and his EU colleagues.</P>
    <P>UNTAET must also address the problems of increasing lawlessness caused, in part, by high unemployment, the increase in rough justice by victims of human rights violations and the integration of Falintil forces into society. UNTAET plans to address these by the speedy delivery of financial resources by the international community and the putting in place of a programme of quick start projects which would provide employment as well as through the establishment of a police force and judicial system which would provide a system of law and order. The demobilisation and reintegration into society of Falintil will require co-operation by its members as well as the political parties.</P>
    <P>UNTAET is also taking responsibility for the co-ordination of humanitarian aid. The Government has provided over £900,000 to date in humanitarian assistance to the Timorese people. <Col N="1113" /> At least a further £1.1 million will be spent on humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in 2000. In addition, APSO is collaborating with the United Nations volunteer agency to provide volunteers to support the recovery effort.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR estimates the number of refugees remaining in West Timor and other parts of Indonesia to be about 110,000. It is widely accepted that up to 60,000 of these may not want to return. The Indonesian Government has set a deadline of 31 March for refugees to decide whether they will return or opt for resettlement in Indonesia. The UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration are facilitating the safe and orderly return of refugees.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian situation has stabilised. The provision of shelter, basic health and education remain priorities as does the process of nation building. The recent visit by the Taoiseach to East Timor reflects the Government's commitment to playing its part with the rest of the international community in supporting a successful transition to full independence.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to open an aid office in Dili to manage our programme of assistance and to support the East Timorese people to make a successful transition to full independence. The Department of Foreign Affairs has just completed an assessment visit to East Timor which looked at the priorities for assistance in 2000 in consultation with representatives of the East Timorese people. The assessment visit also offered the opportunity to examine in detail the modalities of establishing a presence on the ground in the context of the overall programme of assistance.</P>
    <P>The size and range of the tasks should not be underestimated. The key challenges for UNTAET are, on the one hand, to direct and implement the urgently required programmes of physical and economic reconstruction and development while, on the other, promoting reconciliation and co-operation among the East Timorese people. A further key challenge of this process will be to avoid the development of a dependency mentality on the part of the East Timorese which would only hinder their progress and ability to assume in full the responsibilities of their independence.</P>

It would be inappropriate to open a consulate as there is no Government in place at present and there is an interim administration. The aid office will be a way of monitoring the development of our humanitarian assistance to East Timor and liaising with NGOs.</P>

I expect their report shortly.</P>
      <P>There is no way to prevent people moving from the public to the private sector. We used to encourage this but because of the buoyancy in the economy we are losing many good people from the public sector. There are wider implications concerning remuneration packages, levels of pay and so on. There will be problems in the State sector unless we address those issues. The strategic management initiative and the recently agreed partnership process will enable us to introduce levels of pay for professional staff and others which will allow the public sector to hold on to the expertise and talent it needs.</P>

      <P>The jobs initiative programme is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of the programme is to progress participants into mainstream employment. The first phase of participants have completed their term and are now availing of a six month extension in order to address any training or development needs they may have and to allow time for the local employment service to engage more actively with them to facilitate their progression to employment in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>The recent review of the operation of the JI programme by Deloitte &amp; Touche recommended that the eligibility criteria for the programme remain unchanged. My Department has consulted with the social partners on this issue and there is broad agreement that the focus of the programme on the older long-term unemployed should remain as it is. The programme will have an increased emphasis on progression to employment in the open labour market. There is some need, however, for flexibility in defining what constitutes progression and the pace at which it can occur. Different options will be appropriate depending on individual circumstances. Therefore, as recommended by the consultants, it is likely that some roll-over will be necessary to facilitate overall progression.</P>
      <P>The consultation process will be completed shortly at which point new guidelines will be issued.</P>

      <P>We were not in a position to engage in consultation before the initial three year period expired so we extended the programme for six months. That six month period lasts until the end of June, when 226 people will be affected. We are finalising the consultation process and a decision should be made by Easter. There must be some flexibility &ndash; hard and fast rules cannot apply in every case. These are people in similar circumstances but their experiences may differ. While the majority will progress into the labour market after three years, there are others who will regress to the live register, and we do not want that to happen. It is my intention to introduce a degree of flexibility in individual cases and leave discretion to the experts who deal with individuals on a case by case basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, notwithstanding the extension until the end of June, it is important that workers, promoters and sponsors within the programme know about its continuation? Does the Minister recall receiving a comprehensive submission about the Deloitte &amp; Touche review from the Tallaght Partnership? That review contained valuable and insightful remarks about the complexities to which the Minister referred &ndash; the differences in projects and the difficulties in progression. It appears that some of the sponsors never intended that there would be progression. Will the Minister respond to the submission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the submission. There are a number of things to do &ndash; we must strengthen the training element involved and enhance the role of the local employment service. I will do that. In the main, however, the sponsors are voluntary bodies and some of them do not intend that the person involved would progress. Many of the people involved in the initiative have been carrying out valuable work for voluntary bodies which could not continue without them. These are issues which involve community employment, the jobs initiative and the sustaining of such work for voluntary bodies and schools in future. We will have to make a decision on the jobs initiative which bears in mind the recommendations of the consultants but which leaves a degree of flexibility for the local employment service to decide how the scheme might operate in individual sponsor and participant cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>A central conclusion of the Tallaght Partnership submission was that to describe the job initiative programme, as Deloitte &amp; Touche did, as an active labour market programme was extremely simplistic. By continuing the focus on older workers, is the Minister acknowledging that for older workers progression is often more difficult than for younger workers? What hope can the Minister offer groups working in social <Col N="1118" /> economy projects, the displacement of which would have very serious consequences? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte. Many of these projects were established with a view to helping unemployed people progress into regular labour market jobs and they have not been successful. Clearly the older a person is, the more difficult it is. We now live in a high-tech environment which is alien to many people over 35. Enormous efforts are being made with FIT and other programmes to help older unemployed people adapt to the new employment situation and we must do more in this area.</P>
      <P>There is an important role for the social economy in the area and by Easter I should be able to make a definitive decision on the job initiative programme which deals with the needs of the older long-term unemployed, those who are over 35 and who have been out of work for more than five years. They are the main focus in the economy. Long-term unemployment has fallen to 2.1%. We could effectively eliminate it by using the appropriate programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has never been automatic entitlement to grant assistance from the State's enterprise agencies or boards in the history of this State. Financial incentives are provided to entrepreneurs to encourage the creation of well-paid and sustainable jobs and to offset location or other competitive disadvantages.</P>
      <P>At present, there is virtually full employment in the economy. In parallel, there are very serious labour shortages nationwide. Interest rates, which are critical to investment decisions and business confidence, are at a traditionally very low level. These circumstances contrast more than favourably with the position in October 1992, when the city and county enterprise boards were first established by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enterprise boards support for the development of micro-enterprises, that is, groups of ten employees or less, for the period 2000-06 will be determined by the productive investment subprogramme of the Border, midlands and western, BMW, and southern and eastern, S &amp; E operational programmes of the national development plan. In the BMW region, because of its dependence on traditional and declining economic sectors, the role of the county and city enterprise <Col N="1119" /> boards in job creation will continue to be the primary task.</P>
    <P>At the moment, consultation and discussions are taking place between officials of our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the management of the city and county enterprise boards, on the new operational programme. The relevant decisions will be taken by us before the commencement of the new programme in June next.</P>
    <P>These operational programmes envisage a progressive shift by the boards from the provision of direct financial assistance to softer forms of support such as advice, mentoring and management development and increasing recourse to refundable aid. This change in direction is designed to move the focus of the boards to higher value-added jobs in manufacturing and international services, and to increasing competitiveness through access to e-business and the promotion of quality management and best practice. The boards will in future offer an integrated package of supports geared towards the development needs of micro-enterprises.</P>
    <P>Micro-enterprises, in common with other commercial operators, will benefit significantly from the proposed introduction of the low rate of corporation tax of 12.5% with effect from the year 2003.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why the new guidelines to enterprise boards reduce capital grants from 50% to 35% of the cost of a job in the BMW region and to 30% in the rest of the State? Will he explain why employment grants can only be given in exceptional circumstances where it can be demonstrated that labour shortages do not exist? The rate is being cut from £5,000 per job to £3,500. Does the Minister agree that this move goes against the point of keeping Objective One status for the disadvantaged regions?</P>
      <P>The EU agreed to total grants of up to 55% for small businesses compared to 27.5% in the eastern and southern region. The double grant rate is not being maintained which is a major loss to small companies intending to create jobs. Does the Minister agree these changes only apply to micro-enterprises creating one to ten jobs and that this directive does not apply to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA? I am bitterly disappointed because it is from small acorns that large oaks grow, and this Government does not endorse that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy was listening. I said that consultations and discussions are going on at the moment between officials in our Department and the management of the boards. Initial proposals have been made regarding those discussions but we will take the final decision at political level when we receive reports from the officials engaged in those consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to take into account the fact we cannot look at the micro-enterprise in the context <Col N="1120" /> of grant aid only. If one compares the grant aid proposed for foreign direct investment and indigenous investment for medium to large companies with micro-enterprise operators, one will understand there is a much greater opportunity for the bigger companies, both foreign corporations and our own larger companies, to spend much more money on training, e-commerce, mentoring, management, advice and consultancy than the smaller micro-companies, which have a much lower base and a lower volume of turnover and which have a greater need for cash support.</P>
    <P>Consequently, we are looking at a situation whereby we can make a much greater package of measures available to smaller companies. When we receive the information from the management of the various boards, we will take the final decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a longwinded reply. Is the employment grant being reduced from £5,000 to £3,500? Is the grant being reduced from 50% to 35% in the west? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am very disappointed that Deputy Perry said I gave a longwinded reply. I am delighted to see his party's conversion to the boards because when I conceived this idea in 1992, his party spokesman went on television and opposed the establishment of the boards. Now that the boards have exceeded by 250% their initial job targets, there are many converts, which I very much welcome.</P>
      <P>Be assured that we have the utmost commitment to the boards and that the Tánaiste and I will take on board the advice available from our officials and the management of the boards. We will take the positive decisions necessary in due course while taking into account the needs of a modern economy and the efforts required to stimulate economic activity in the more disadvantaged regions.</P>

      <P>Current high levels of premiums for young drivers are directly related to adverse claims experience of young drivers as a risk category. Accordingly, the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness amongst all drivers, including <Col N="1121" /> young drivers. In my own area these include: the establishment in 1998 of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board; the abolition of the cap on brokers commissions in 1999, which should introduce further competition into the market and the establishment of a special working group to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions. The group will present its final report shortly. In the light of its report, I will consider what follow up to the work of this group is necessary.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept &ndash; I mean no disrespect to him &ndash;  that is the answer trotted out for many years on this issue? Does he accept it is of no value to young male drivers, in particular, who cannot get access to insurance? If an insurer takes them on, it is at exorbitant rates. I am sure the Minister is familiar with the recent IBA survey which suggested that the quotes, in so far as one can get them, are in danger of going through the £4,000 per annum barrier for young male drivers.</P>

I would like to resolve this issue but the facts and the statistics make it virtually impossible and it is against that background we must operate. Our priority must be to make sure cover is available and to ensure there are viable and liquidity strong insurance companies to give the cover.</P>
      <P>It is against that background and looking at all the surveys, analysis and statistical data that we are doing what we can as quickly as we can to ensure we change the situation. However, there will have to be a huge change in the attitude of responsible people who have come through the system and young people who want cover. There will have to be many changes across the board. Our Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in particular, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána and others are doing what they can to make major changes. Slowly, but surely, we are making some progress.</P>

      <P>The Minister said one of his duties is to make cover available but, plainly, cover is not available. Again, I instance the IBA survey. It took a fictional 22 year old professional male with a 1999 Volkswagen car in Kildare and sought quotes. Only Quinn Direct gave a quote of £3,712. Cover is not available. Surely, this is a temptation to young drivers to go on the road without insurance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no figures to suggest there are more uninsured drivers on the road now than previously. As the Minister of State charged with responsibility for this area, I have not received many representations in recent years from people who have been refused cover. Cover is being made available but at a very high cost. My priority is to ensure that cost is reduced in so far as it can be. I have tried everything possible to do that in consultation with the insurance industry and the motor industry and those consultations are ongoing. The motor insurance advisory board is trying to ascertain if we can come up with a new formula or a new structure. Such a new structure would involve a major change and, if we make the progress we hope, it might not be so palatable to people. We hope such a new structure would be accepted &ndash; although that would not be easy &ndash; which would allow young people to get cover but there would be certain limitations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State does not seem to understand the urgency of the fact that young people are not able to get insurance cover. My colleague, Deputy Upton, tabled this question on foot of representations she received and I am sure every Member has received similar representations. Is it not the case that many young males, in particular, cannot get cover and that to offer them cover at a premium in the order of £4,000 is tantamount to offering them no cover? Is it not time to consider what possible interventions the State might make to deal with this problem? Some of these young people need their cars to go to work, they need them for their livelihoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that a man of Deputy Rabbitte's experience would call for the intervention of the State on this issue. We are debarred by European Union rules from interfering in this area. We cannot interfere with the market, the insurance industry or direct that cover be given. All we can do is try to create an environment and a legislative framework within which people can compete for cover and ensure that the industry responds to that. Based on the information and statistical data available, it is clear that no insurance company here is making a profit on motor insurance cover. They all have underwriting losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Deputy was in the Department in 1997 he requested the professional staff to carry out an evaluation and they concluded there were <Col N="1123" /> underwriting losses and that no excessive profits were being made by the insurance companies here that provide motor cover. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which is made up of eminent people, some of whom have major skills in this area, is analysing this matter in great detail and I await its report.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Employment Agencies Act, 1971, a person shall not carry on the business of an employment agency except under and in accordance with a licence under that Act. In 1999, 447 employment agencies were licensed to operate and 23 new licences were issued to date this year. All licences issued under the Act have a validity period of one year at the end of which, subject to continued adherence by the licensees to the relevant governing conditions, they are renewed upon application.</P>
      <P>Under provisions specified in section 9 (2) of the Employment Agency Regulations, 1972, employment agency licence holders are required to furnish returns to me on a twice yearly basis indicating, <i>inter alia</i>, the number of persons whom they have placed in employment within and outside the State. The returns so furnished to me in respect of the period January-June 1999 indicate that, in that period, a total of 35,028 people were placed in employment, that is, 31,982 within the State and 3,046 outside the State. Of those placed within the State 17,374 were granted permanent positions and 14,608 were granted temporary positions. Of those placed outside the State 805 were granted permanent positions and 2,241 were granted temporary positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary instrument by which employment agency activity is monitored/regulated is the licensing scheme. Licences are issued to applicants only when they have fulfilled, to the full satisfaction of my Department, the relevant governing conditions as laid down by the 1971 Act and by regulations made thereunder. These conditions are designed, in the main, to ensure that only persons who are of good character and who carry on employment agency business from prem<Col N="1124" /> ises which are suitable for that purpose are granted licences. In assessing applications my Department operates a policy of strict adherence to all the licensing criteria. Monitoring activity also involves the checking of daily newspapers to ensure that employment agencies which advertise are licensed in accordance with the Act.</P>
    <P>Under the Act, employment agencies are required to submit statistics showing the number of placements, both permanent and temporary and also placements outside the State. In the event of a complaint against a particular agency, the labour inspectorate of my Department is empowered under the Act to investigate any such complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. Does he agree that the biggest difficulty facing employers and business is a skills shortage and a shortage of workers? Does he also agree that an opening exists for certain so-called employment agencies to take advantage of this difficulty? While most employment agencies are reputable, has the attention of the Minister of State been drawn to some employment agencies engaging in churning practices, whereby they place workers with a company and shortly afterwards contact the workers and offer them positions with other companies, thereby putting the initial company at a disadvantage? Has the Minister of State any plans to monitor more closely this alleged activity, as it is causing difficulties for businesses and it constitutes unfair competition for reputable agencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We are conscious of the problems concerning skills in certain sectors. From the figures I quoted, the Deputy will note that the employment agencies are providing many workers but not enough. That is why the Government has referred to the need for additional workers not only from the European Economic Area but from outside it. The practice to which the Deputy referred is one of which we are aware. The problem is how to deal with it on a legislative basis. I am willing to take it up with the labour inspectorate or my officials to ascertain how we can deal with it. The problem is how to deal with these type of issues on a legal basis.</P>
      <P>These agencies must meet certain criteria, in that they must be of good character, etc.  With regard to the reports that I am given, I will closely monitor the position. This is a very lucrative area. These businesses are doing extremely well. They are private employment agencies and they have to adhere to a certain legal framework. They also have their own agency and must adhere to a certain code of practice.</P>

There were 11 cases in 1995, eight in 1996, four in 1997, three in 1998 and nine in 1999. The majority of these cases involved multiple offences under the Act, including the offence of failure to pay statutory minimum rates of pay as specified in employment regulation orders made under and in accordance with the Act.</P>
      <P>In the same period 37 cases were referred by the labour inspectorate to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for the institution of legal proceedings against employers for offences under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1969 and 1990. A further 40 cases involving offences under these Acts are at present in the course of preparation for referral by the labour inspectorate to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for initiation of legal proceedings against the employers involved.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Industrial Relations Acts are being properly policed. In 1999 4,611 visits to employers' premises were carried out by the labour inspectors to check for compliance with the Acts and a similar inspection rate can be expected in the present year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also wish to be aware that the labour inspectorate of my Department is being augmented by the addition of seven extra inspectors being appointed in the context of the implementation of the national minimum wage and who will also be engaged in implementing the full range of employment legislation generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister of State say he is satisfied as to the adequacy of inspections when we have only a handful of referrals to court over a period of five years? What changes are proposed in terms of enforcement when the new National Minimum Wage Act becomes law? Will there be a unitary enforcement section of the Department that will monitor breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act or employment regulation orders under the Industrial Relations Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>modus operandi</i> of the inspectors is clear. In the past a blitz of inspections was carried out on particular categories of industry. Catering and services were closely investigated in recent times. The first step is to ensure that employers are compliant. That first stage involves the inspectors giving an initial warning. Clearly <Col N="1126" /> the motivation is to try to help employees. If they are successful, legal proceedings are not necessary. Many cases are resolved at that level.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question relates to how the inspectors will operate in the context of the new minimum wage legislation. The inspectorate will now be involved in enforcing all the legislation, whether the National Minimum Wage Act or legislation relating to the protection of young workers. That is one area where there is a need for a strong presence of inspectors. If complaints are made by individuals, the inspectors will follow them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the role of the inspectorate, will it operate after 5 p.m. and at weekends? What would be the additional costs associated with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates particularly to the protection of young workers. The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. I understand this question was raised here before. There are new provisions for inspectors to work at weekends and late at night. That is an important development. This was not the case some time ago. One could argue that seven inspectors is not a huge number, but the number we were working with is 11. In my Department we had to deal with the whole question of safety inspectors and increase the complement there. Equally this is an important area. I stress that there is always a facility for people to complain. It is an important element of this debate that inspectors will follow up on complaints. The other element is to pursue particular sectors where there are problems with regard to workers' rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get that additional information for the Deputy. The vast majority are based in Dublin. I do not see this as a major problem. If there is a geographical blitz or a sectoral blitz, it should not be a huge logistical problem for people to carry out that blitz. I will be glad to pass on to the Deputy any additional information in regard to the precise spread of inspectors.</P>

Substantial pro<Col N="1127" /> gress has been made in the implementation of the recommendations of the first report of the expert group which addressed the skills needs of the electronics and software sectors of the economy. Key aspects of progress include an additional investment of £75 million for the provision of 5,400 information technology places at third level; an additional £6 million allocation towards provision of 1,500 places on ICT post-graduate conversion courses; and an extra £3.2 million allocation to FÁS for an additional 730 places in information technology skills.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is consideration being given to the less conventional methods of making a contribution towards tackling the skills shortage? I am talking about young people who drop out of school early, who may not have general academic qualifications or aptitudes but who have very pertinent aptitudes in terms of technology and the information society. Is the Minister familiar, for example, with the programme called CITI, Clondalkin Information Technology Initiative, which was the brainchild of one businessman? On the basis of interviews for aptitude for computer programming, a small number of young people who had not sat the leaving certificate were selected and, within 11 months, were turned out as competent computer programmers and employed in industry. Will the skills committee look at that kind of initiative? My fear is that it is regarded as subversive of the system and that there is no room for that kind of unconventional approach to making a contribution towards the skills needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte makes a very valid point. We have been too traditional in the way we have looked at supplying skills needs. The Deputy is right in saying that many people drop out of school. He made the point at the committee yesterday that there is not always a correlation between IQ and rate of pay. There are many people who, for one reason or other, perhaps to do with their level of maturity or their family circumstances, did not get a chance to complete formal education and who, many years later, have had great success. To a large extent it is environmental factors that make that possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second report deals with other ways of addressing some of the skills needs in the economy, high skills needs and lower skills needs, because this economy is suffering from a shortage in many respects. The fast track to technology, which is a joint private sector-public sector initiative with 3,500 long-term unemployed people has proved itself to me. There is a very successful programme at the moment in Deansrath College, Clondalkin. I went to meet the group of people who are involved in it and nearly all of them told me they never thought they would use a computer. They were not technology-friendly, yet <Col N="1128" /> with appropriate support they became involved in a very enjoyable course which will lead to a successful career. We need to look at ways of fulfilling skills needs, as suggested by Deputy Rabbitte, other than the formal education system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The skills group, previously chaired by Danny O'Hare and now chaired by Chris Horan, is composed of people from the public sector, Government, education and industry. It was put in place with a view to doing some forecasting because, due to the extent of our success which surprised us all, we have been engaged, to a large extent, in fire brigade action. For the future we need to be able to forecast what is required, in so far as one can, assuming the current rates of growth continue, so that we can supply more of our needs from our internal requirements. The good thing is that we can respond fairly rapidly to situations. Because our economy is small, education providers can respond to its needs and turn programmes around very quickly. We need to anticipate what is required so that we have the infrastructure in terms of people and buildings and are able to supply people with skills.</P>

      <P>The number of submissions processed to registration by the Companies Registration Office per year has increased by 187% since 1997. Whereas the number of submissions on registered companies awaiting processing stood at 650,000 in December 1997, it now stands at 235,000. The Registrar of Companies is hopeful that the remaining submissions will be cleared by the end of this year. I point out that all but 36,000 of these submissions are scanned and can be inspected by the public. The registrar expects that this scanning backlog, caused by technical problems during 1999, will be cleared by the end of May of this year.</P>
      <P>These significant improvements in efficiency take place against a backdrop of a vigorous enforcement campaign, started by the office in September 1998. Following the tightening of the rules on company strike-off, brought into effect by the latest Companies Act, the office is now gearing up for the most extensive strike-off process ever undertaken with up to 70,000 companies targeted.</P>
      <P>Whereas in 1997, 36% of companies due to file a return did so, that figure increased to 57% in 1999. The aim of the CRO is to increase that to 100% this year. While much remains to be achieved, I am happy with the progress made by the Companies Registration Office in its efforts to provide a faster and more efficient service to the public.</P>

      <P>I gave a figure regarding IRNRs some time ago but I do not have it with me. However, thousands of them were scrubbed from the register last year. Regarding staff, in 1997, following approval by the Government, the authorised staff complement of the Companies Registration Office was increased from 80 to 120. It has not proved possible to achieve the full complement of staff. Approximately 112 staff are currently serving. The number increased from 80 to 112 and there is Government approval for 120 if necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. My recollection of the reply I gave on the last occasion this matter was raised is that there was a high number of strike-offs in that area. The figure was higher than one would expect. The Deputy may be assured that the director of the Companies Registration Office is doing a wonderful job with a great team of staff in assiduously tracking such companies. Any company which does not conform with the current law will be struck off.</P>
      <P>The full complement of 120 staff has not been achieved because it is a matter of supply and demand. That was the witty intervention about which the Deputy was getting nervous. There is huge competition in the marketplace and jobs are plentiful. The number of people available is not as great as previously and, consequently, people are opting for other short-term opportunities as distinct from long-term, secure positions.</P>

      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, sets out the statutory rights for employees in respect of holiday entitlements. The Act provides for the following nine public holidays per year &ndash; 1 January, New Year's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter Monday, the first Monday in May, the first Monday in June, the first Monday in August, the last Monday in October, Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day. The average public holiday entitlement in the EU at present is approximately 11 days annually.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the suggestion by the National Women's Council that an additional paid public holiday should be created to recognise the contribution made by women to the wealth and health of the nation.

I did not have an opportunity to contribute to the Seanad debate because I was attending a committee meeting. However, if I had a choice between designating a public holiday and introducing policies which are related to equality legislation or gender equality in employment policies, backed up by initiatives to facilitate women's integration in employment, I would choose the latter.</P>
      <P>We should be judged on our actions and our deeds in relation to these issues. I make this point as somebody who served for a short time as the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs &ndash; it was my first ministry. Men have a role to play in that debate. The figures regarding women's participation in the workplace are very impressive now. FÁS and the other agencies are trying to facilitate equality of participation and integration. We should focus on that aspect. The Government's official position, as outlined in the Seanad debate, is that it will consider the matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is my intention to present to the Government next Tuesday a memorandum in relation to immigration policy. There is a need for a proactive policy. At present an employer must find an employee and then make an application to my Department for a permit. If those employees live abroad, it is a cumbersome process which takes a long time. It is not satisfactory. The intention is <Col N="1132" /> to have a proactive policy to identify on a skills basis people who could be offered jobs in this economy from outside the EEA and to put a mechanism in place, through FÁS and other agencies, to recruit such persons. The Government will make a decision on that matter next Tuesday and, when a decision is made, the proposals will be published.</P>
      <P>Mr. Paul Tansey, who carried out an economic study for Forfás, forecast that in order for the terms of the national development plan to be implemented, it will be necessary to bring an additional 200,000 workers into the country. Although the labour force is growing in this country, it is doing so at a much slower rate than in other European countries. We estimate that 100,000 of those 200,000 people will comprise Irish people returning to Ireland from abroad. A huge effort is currently being made to attract Irish citizens back into the country.</P>
      <P>Some 2,500 of the people currently seeking asylum in Ireland are qualified to work and they have been issued with authorisations by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A unit is being established within FÁS to assist them with training and securing employment.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Newspaper Industry also recommended that an independent ombudsman be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards. I strongly support this recommendation but implementation is clearly a matter for the newspaper industry itself. I understand the industry may be linking this recommendation to other recommendations in the commission's report concerning changes in the libel laws. This is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has indicated that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department.</P>

      <P>The answer to the last question is yes. It is extremely important, particularly in an electronic and digital environment, that we would consider cross-ownership. I intend to read the report of the review group which I would like to publish in the next two weeks. The report runs to more than 300 pages and the group has given considerable consideration to the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I have stated on many occasions that competition in the newspaper industry is perhaps more important than in any other area. I am a strong advocate of competition which brings about change and increases consumer choice more quickly than anything else. That is particularly the case in the newspaper industry and that view will guide me in regard to any decisions I make after reading the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue. As the Minister is aware, growers in the Cork area have suffered a number of blows in recent years, the first being the downgrading and closure of the Universal Food Plant in Midleton which resulted in the loss of 18 full-time jobs and a number of seasonal jobs. Those losses impacted hugely on the livelihood of growers and contractors in the area. The most recent blow was the cessation of trading of the Cork Vegetable Producers Group, a company established to market and organise growers in the area. I pay tribute to Tesco which moved into the area and which is a very good customer of the growers.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that neither Minister of State, Deputy Davern, nor Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, could not be present this evening, particularly given that this matter relates to Deputy O'Keeffe's constituency. However, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, to the House. Will the Minister of State inform the House what Bord Glas is doing to ensure the future of the horticulture industry in the Cork area? Will he communicate with Bord Glas and ask it to set up some form of co-operative or growers' group in the area in order that products can be marketed and that standards and markets for high quality products can be maintained? We must maintain standards and continuity of supply. At present, a great uncertainty exists in the region in that regard. Everyone is aware of the difficulties being endured by members of the farming community and this is a major blow to farmers in the region to which I refer. I accept that the market is being sustained through the efforts of the Dublin Meath Growers Society, but the market may not be sustainable in the long-term.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to intervene and to use the good offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Bord Glas to assist in organising growers and ensuring that warehousing and whatever else is required, in order that the horticulture industry in Cork, which has a long and good history, is maintained, developed and advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential for the industry is great. I will not refer to it as an alternative industry, but it is alternative to what we normally associate with agriculture. I make this plea on behalf of the growers, contractors and workers in the area. Now is the time to act. I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments and I hope he will promise positive action on behalf of Bord Glas and the <Col N="1136" /> Department. There is a need to provide hope for the people of Cork, particularly those who live in the eastern part of the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, regrets that he cannot be present to take it.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the bitter disappointment in Cork following the cessation of trading of the Cork Potato and Vegetable Producer Group. The group which represented 22 growers played a significant role in the economy of the local area since it was set up in the early 1990s. The cessation of trading will effect not only the growers whose produce the group marketed but also the wider rural community. Following the closure of Universal Foods last year, this cessation is particularly disappointing.</P>
      <P>Community financial assistance is available through the Department to recognised producer organisations setting up an operational fund and implementing an operational program. This aid can assist growers in meeting the challenges facing them in satisfying the demands of the multiples in terms of supply and distribution. I would encourage the establishment of producer groups in the light of the ongoing developments in the market.</P>
      <P>Funding of £14 million for horticulture and £4 million for potatoes is being made available under the national development plan. In my opinion the provisions in the plan provide the proper framework for the future of the industry. This is in addition to the funds available for the producer groups. There will also be a major investment of £282 million in the food sector for capital investment, marketing, research and development and training. Projects for processing of horticultural produce will be included in the measures.</P>
      <P>Horticulture operates in a very competitive international environment and does so without the EU market supports available for the main agricultural commodities. The growth and influence of the main supermarket chains and the advent of central purchasing have put horticultural producers under pressure to update their facilities and equipment. The proposed measures will help producers to increase their on-farm capital investments to meet this challenge in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>Given the level of funding available for primary production and processing of horticultural products as well as producer groups there is ample opportunity for growers both nationally and in the Cork area to upgrade facilities and produce better quality crops in an environmentally friendly manner, thereby meeting the increasing standards being set by consumers and the supermarket multiples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The reason I raise the possibility of establishing a district veterinary office to serve County Leitrim, particularly its southern part, is that it is currently served by the district veterinary office in Sligo which acts for both counties. However, as the Minister of State is aware, many areas of south Leitrim are situated up to 60 miles from Sligo. If farmers have business to do which cannot be done by telephone they must visit the office in Sligo which can often be a full day's work.</P>
      <P>There is a need to establish a veterinary office in the southern part of County Leitrim to serve that area. The area to which I refer is home to a large number of farmers who have, for a long period, stated that there is a need to provide facilities close by. Modern technology should enable the establishment of such an office without any great inconvenience in respect of staff displacement or other matters. Members are aware of the number of people seeking transfers under the decentralisation programme and there will be no difficulty in encouraging them to take up positions should it be decided to provide a veterinary office to serve the south Leitrim area.</P>
      <P>There is no need to discuss in detail the hardship which has been caused in the past, not as a result of inaction on the part of departmental officials but by virtue of the fact that people have been forced to travel to Sligo to rectify problems or clarify queries which cannot be dealt with by telephone.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to request the Minister to investigate fully the possibility of establishing a district veterinary office in south Leitrim. This service should be made available on as local a basis as possible and the provision of such an office would ensure that the service would be of benefit to the community and to the economic well-being of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for raising this matter on the Adjournment. In terms of customer service the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development endeavours to provide a readily accessible efficient service to all its clients and customers. The Department is committed to achieving the objectives of the strategic management initiative and to giving effect to the principles of quality customer service for customers and clients of the Civil Service which were recommended in Delivering Better Government. The Department also recognises that its fundamental purpose is to serve the citizen in a proper, fair and impartial manner and is determined that all its dealings should conform to the Ombudsman's guide to standards of best practice for public servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for this reason the Department already has a highly decentralised structure. The Department employs some 4,500 people, including 600 job sharers. Over 75% of these staff are decentralised. For administrative and customer <Col N="1138" /> service purposes the decentralised staff are located in four main regional offices, Wexford, Portlaoise, Cavan and Castlebar, 27 principal local offices and 37 subsidiary local offices; 13 laboratories, including six veterinary research laboratories, one brucellosis laboratory, one meat control laboratory, three dairy science laboratories, one pesticide control laboratory and one seed testing laboratory; five farms/stations &ndash; Abbotstown research farm, Dublin, Tully bull station, Kildare, the potato farm and propagation centre, Raphoe, and two cereal variety testing stations in Kildare and Cork, and 115 commercial food premises, mainly meat and dairy processing plants.</P>
    <P>Providing a service in close proximity to our customers must be balanced with achieving certain economies of scale, which allows some scope for temporary redeployment of staff to meet peak demands in certain areas in order to achieve optimal efficiency and effectiveness. The current arrangement of combining the Sligo and Leitrim district veterinary offices in one location seeks to achieve just such a result.</P>
    <P>The Department would also highlight the fact that most contact with its local offices is through the telephone system. The Department's telephone system has been significantly upgraded in recent years. Farmers contacting the local office by telephone can make inquiries not only about schemes operated by that local office but can also have their call transferred to other offices of the Department. In this way they can easily inquire about the progress of schemes being operated by offices such as Portlaoise, where our special beef premium unit is based, or the Wexford office which deals with rural environment protection schemes and early retirement schemes.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that a number of departmental and Teagasc offices are already located in County Leitrim. The county is served by a farm development service office located in Carrick-on-Shannon and Teagasc has offices located in the County Leitrim towns of Carrick-on-Shannon, Mohill, Manorhamilton and Ballinamore.</P>
    <P>The Department is satisfied that the present arrangement of having both district veterinary offices located in Sligo is more efficient, both administratively and operationally, than if the Leitrim office was relocated to an area in County Leitrim. There are administrative advantages in having both offices together, such as a pooling of staff to cover duties in either county. If a dedicated district veterinary office were to be set up in Leitrim, extra staffing resources would be required, the benefit of which would not be readily apparent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important issue. Cerebral Palsy Ireland and the North-Eastern Health Board have identified more than 450 children from <Col N="1139" /> counties Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth with physical, sensory and learning disabilities and developmental delays, who require a specialist assessment and treatment service in the region. Currently, many of these children are travelling to Dublin for specific rehabilitation services. The follow-up service for these children is limited in the north-eastern region. There are limited therapy services currently available in the region for children with disabilities. Specialised services, including assistive technology, seating and so on, are not available locally.</P>
      <P>In addition to the lack of specialist services, there is a lack of clinical space, resources and equipment for services currently based in the region. The North-Eastern Health Board and CPI have been working together since the mid-1990s to prepare a plan which responds to these specific acute needs. This plan has been finalised and forwarded to the Department of Health and Children as a joint business plan from both the CPI and the North-Eastern Health Board. The proposal comprises two assessment centres to be located in the region, one in the grounds of Cavan General Hospital and the second adjacent to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. These two proposed centres will provide assessment services to children with physical and sensory disabilities aged up to 18 years throughout the region and children with learning disabilities up to six years. In addition, follow-up treatment services will be provided at these centres for children from counties Cavan and Louth. Locally based treatment centres will also be located in counties Meath and Monaghan to provide ongoing services for children from those counties.</P>
      <P>Services provided through the CPI and the North-Eastern Health Board initiative will include full interdisciplinary team involvement with children and families, the provision of early intensive support services for children under five years and a wide range of family support services. The proposal has been identified as the number one priority in the region for children's services by the regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services and funding has been secured which will allow for the commencement of services in Cavan and Meath from July 2000. This funding will total £311,500 in 2000, rising to £628,000 from 2001 onwards. The total capital costs of this proposal, which I am glad to support, is £2.25 million. Cerebral Palsy Ireland has committed a total of £800,000 towards these capital costs from their capital fundraising. The remaining £1.45 million is being sought from Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board and CPI are awaiting overall project approval from the Department of Health and Children and an indication of capital funding support prior to any <Col N="1140" /> element of the service commencing in Cavan and Meath in 2000. As the service is intended to be a regional response to the needs of the entire region, CPI and the North-Eastern Health Board need support for the project from the Department before any element can commence. This project plan was analysed by an independent consultant in 1999 who gave the proposal a positive response.</P>
    <P>The proposed project represents an imaginative and innovative partnership approach from both the voluntary and statutory sector, that is the health board and CPI, to the specific needs of children with disabilities in the north-east region. The proposed services are in accordance with the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disability which recommended the establishment of regional child assessment teams and the incorporation of specific services for children with sensory impairment.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate for the Minister to issue approval to the North-Eastern Health Board to proceed with the first of the new assessment centres in Cavan. I am glad the Government, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and the Minister, Deputy Martin, are committed to the development of a wide range of services for people with a physical or mental handicap. I hope the Minister will respond positively to an innovative project supported by the North-Eastern Health Board and Cerebral Palsy Ireland.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter on the Adjournment. On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify the matter of the provision of services, including child assessment and treatment services, for children with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, it is a matter for health boards, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities, to decide on priority services for development in their functional area, having regard to the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services, Towards an Independent Future. This report recommended the establishment of regional child assessment teams in each health board area and my Department is fully committed to the implementation of this recommendation in respect of each health board area.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board report, Mapping the Shape of Future Services 1999-2003, has identified the establishment of a regional child development and assessment service as a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals have been drawn up jointly by the North-Eastern Health Board and Cerebral Palsy <Col N="1141" /> Ireland and their comprehensive model for services and the costed business plan has the support of the co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services.</P>
    <P>This three-phase plan provides for two centres, one in Cavan and one in Drogheda, providing interdisciplinary specialist assessment and consultant services for all children with physical disability, sensory impairment and developmental delay throughout the region. Services will include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology and social work services, and these services will be provided by Cerebral Palsy Ireland in partnership with the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Outreach and home based programmes will be provided in addition to centre based therapy. Children from the local areas will also attend for ongoing centre based therapy while satellite centres will be established in Monaghan and Meath to provide ongoing therapy programmes for children from these counties, thus eliminating the need for children and families to travel outside their counties except for assessment services.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the plan relates to the development of the regional assessment and treatment centre in Cavan. Ongoing revenue funding was allocated by the health board last year for a number of additional paediatric therapy posts to support the outreach services for children with physical and sensory disabilities and this year additional ongoing revenue has been allocated for the first phase of the implementation of this joint regional child assessment and treatment service in Cavan and Meath. This service will commence this year. Indicative allocations of capital funding under the national development plan over the next seven years, 2000 to 2007, have recently been advised to the health boards and fully comprehend the capital funding requirements for assessment and treatment centres in each of the health board areas, including the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>Ballybunion Castle is located on the Castle Green in Ballybunion and is an internationally recognised landmark. It continues to feature on postcards and in television documentaries. It is extensively referred to in the literature of north Kerry and has been immortalised in prose and verse by writers such as John B. Keane and Bryan MacMahon. Ballybunion Castle was constructed in the early 1500s by a branch of the Geraldines, the Fitzmaurices, Lords of Kerry, who resided in my neighbouring parish of Lixnaw. The Bunion family was placed in the castle to act as retainers and in the decades to follow the town took its name from this family. The castle was destroyed in a raid by Lord Kerry in <Col N="1142" /> 1582 and in 1583 William Óg Bunion had his lands confiscated due to his part in the Desmond rebellion. Thomas Fitzmaurice, the 16th Lord of Kerry, made a submission to King James having the lands confirmed by his patent of 1612. The Fitzmaurices retained their lands through the 1641 rebellion, the confiscations of 1651 and the 1690 wars. The castle then passed to Richard Hare in 1783 and has been a national monument&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;under the care of the Office of Public Works since 1923. Ownership of the castle is unclear at this stage and may never be fully resolved.</P>
      <P>The castle, despite being imposing, is a ruinous structure and only the tall eastern side remains. Much of the cliff on the western side has eroded and there is also erosion of ground near the north-east corner on the north side, which is further undermining the structure. In late December 1999, a lightning strike caused extensive damage to the castle.</P>
      <P>From the east side there appears to be little damage, although it is clear that masonry fell from the apex and the top corner to the north side. In this area there is a small block of masonry now dislodged which will fall during the next storm if it has not already done so. Passing through the wall, the western side presents a more distressing sight. At some stage a light fitting of floodlight type had been affixed to this wall and it was this light which afforded an easy route for lightning to reach the ground. It is clear that the lightning struck the top of the structure and passed down through the wall, blowing out this light fitting and striking the ground where an area of earth has been blown out, leaving a huge hole. There was no lightning conductor affixed to the castle.</P>
      <P>A section of masonry at the top of the north end has been blown away leaving the interior of the wall in this vulnerable area exposed. The lightning bolt seems to have passed through the wall, dislodging a huge section of masonry that includes part of the springing for a masonry vault, which is now gone. This huge piece of masonry is, perhaps, the most serious problem and will be the most difficult to deal with. From an inspection at ground level it is not possible to appreciate the full extent of the damage at this level but it is clear that substantial consolidation is required. Further down the wall and closer to the ground, the wall gives the appearance of being intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the late 1960s the castle was pointed. Unfortunately, a cement mortar was used and the pointing finish was inappropriate to a medieval structure. It is essential that remedial works be carried out to this structure sooner rather than <Col N="1143" /> later. It is precariously balanced on the cliff and any fall of masonry will crash to the beach below, which is a popular spot for visitors at all times of the year and especially in summer. This presents a definite hazard to the beach users.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to consolidate the top of the wall where a section of masonry has been blown off. To the north it will be necessary to reface with masonry that section of walling which was blown away. Below this the huge block of dislodged masonry will have to be secured and consolidated<i> in situ</i>. This is a specialist job and will require the same type of workmanship currently being used on the south wall of Ardfert Cathedral. Whatever should happen, the castle cannot be left in its current state. It is dangerous and immediate remedial works are the only way forward.</P>
    <P>At present, Kerry County Council has cordoned off the area leading to the approach of the castle with a stout mesh fence to keep the public out. However, this is unsightly in a beauty spot that is renowned the world over. Ballybunion as a tourist destination has suffered a decline in recent years. This damage to its best known landmark is a further blow to the morale of the local population. It is incumbent on the Minister to act immediately and provide the necessary funding and craftsmen to repair and consolidate what remains of this national monument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am aware of his genuine concern for the castle. It was inspected in January by an architect and district works manager from the Department, together with an engineer from Kerry County Council. It had been damaged by lightning over the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to discuss the castle's historic background although, like the Deputy, I am interested in the history of such places. Such monuments are important not only for people who are interested in history but also for the tourism industry and the promotion of our culture and heritage. The castle is neither in the ownership nor the guardianship of the State. It is, however, a recorded monument under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. This affords the castle legal protection in so far as the Minister must be given two months written notice of any proposed work to the monument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy accurately outlined the precarious position of the castle, its ruinous structure and the work that needs to be done. He referred to the falling masonry and the difficulties posed by the light fitting. A section of masonry at the top of the north end has been blown away, leaving the interior of the wall in this vulnerable area exposed. The lightning bolt appears to have <Col N="1144" /> passed through the wall, dislodging a huge section of masonry that includes part of the springing for a masonry vault.</P>
    <P>Some decades ago, possibly in the late 1960s, the castle was pointed. Unfortunately, a cement mortar was used and the pointing finish is not appropriate to the medieval structure. It is essential that remedial works are carried out to the castle sooner rather than later. It is precariously balanced on the cliff and any fall of masonry will crash to the beach below which is a popular spot for visitors. At least half of the structure will need to be scaffolded on both sides. This is necessary not just for the works but to examine the full extent of the lightning damage before a full assessment can be made. It will be necessary to consolidate the top of the wall where a section of masonry has been blown off.</P>
    <P>To the north of this, it will be necessary to reface with masonry that section of walling which was blown away. Just below this, the huge block of dislodged masonry will have to be secured and consolidated <i>in situ</i>. This is a specialist job. In the architect's opinion it will be necessary to repoint this area, grouting it with a structural quality specialist grout and, possibly, insert stainless steel rods to restore its structural integrity.</P>
    <P>Only experienced personnel could undertake this work. Erecting the scaffolding poses its own dangers, given the state of the wall above, but this could be done under the right conditions. It will add to the costs, however. It is impossible to give an estimate for the costs of remedial works before the castle is scaffolded and examined closely at the upper levels. It will be an expensive exercise. Once the castle is scaffolded a lightning conductor should be affixed given the castle's height and exposure.</P>
    <P>The castle is not in my ownership or care. There is no question of my taking this site into State care even if ownership were to be established beforehand. There are many other such monuments throughout the country similarly at risk where my intervention has been sought. However, all the resources available to me are already fully committed for the foreseeable future to the conservation and maintenance of those national monuments that are in State care, such as Ardfert Cathedral, Gallarus Castle and Listowel Castle.</P>
    <P>While I am concerned to see that the future of the castle is safeguarded, the immediate concern is the current dangerous condition of the monument which poses a threat to public safety. It is essential, therefore, that remedial repairs be carried out as a priority. The issue of public safety, where dangerous structures are concerned, is a matter for the local authority, Kerry County Council. Nevertheless, I am prepared to make my professional staff available to advise on the correct procedures to be applied. Any works would have to be carried out by a competent contractor <Col N="1145" /> to a specification appropriate to structural work on medieval buildings. In this regard, the services of a suitable engineer with experience in historic buildings would be required. I am confident that in this way both the public safety imperative and the future preservation of the castle can be satis<Col N="1146" /> factorily achieved. My Department wrote to Kerry County Council on this basis in early February following a joint inspection on site. There has not been a response to date.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 March 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 38, 47, 80, 149 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the suffering being endured by the Iraqi people and at the difficulties arising for the implementation of international humanitarian aid programmes as a result of sanctions. These difficulties have been reflected in the recent resignation of Mr. Hans von Sponeck and in the earlier resignation of his predecessor, Mr. Dennis Halliday, which are disturbing. The director of UNICEF Ireland has also drawn attention to the severe hardship and suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> We are involved in discussions within the EU and the United Nations about the humanitarian situation in Iraq. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised our concerns directly with the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright, on St. Patrick's Day, in Washington. They urged that the United States, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, seek to ensure that the difficulties under the sanctions programme are addressed.</P>
    <P>The imposition and administration of the sanctions remain, primarily, a matter for the Security Council. The Council continues to impose sanctions on Iraq as a result of the Iraqi Government's refusal to co-operate with the UN Special Commission appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The Government regret that Iraq has not so far fully complied with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, particularly as regards the resolutions addressing the question of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>The Security Council has established a committee for the express purpose of overseeing the application of sanctions. A debate is scheduled to take place tomorrow 24 March in the Security Council on sanctions. Contrary to earlier indications, this debate will not be open to non-members of the Security Council. We trust, however, that there will be a full discussion which will contribute towards advancing this issue.</P>
    <P>The Security Council clearly needs to take greater account of the grave humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people in its further consideration of the sanctions issue. In particular, we would advocate a reduction in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme.</P>
    <P>On 17 December 1999, the Security Council adopted a comprehensive resolution, number 1284, in which it decided to continue to impose sanctions against Iraq. In the same resolution, the Security Council unconditionally removed the ceiling on the export of oil to fund the purchase of humanitarian supplies and provided for the suspension, and ultimate lifting, of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with the military, or more properly speaking, disarmament provisions of the resolution.</P>
    <P>In so doing, the Security Council is acting within the powers and responsibilities conferred on it under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Article 41 of the charter empowers the Security Council to interrupt economic relations where it has determined there is a threat to international peace. Ireland stands by its obligation under Article 25 of the charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. This is binding upon all UN member states.</P>
    <P>The Government would urge the Iraqi government to comply with this and other relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as to co-operate adequately with the UN oil for food programme and in particular to ensure equitable dis<Col N="1149" /> tribution to the civilian population of supplies made available under that programme.</P>
    <P>I hope very much that, in the light of the forthcoming discussions in the Security Council, and with the necessary co-operation from Baghdad, real progress can be made towards the reduction of suffering and hardship in Iraq.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The murder of Rosemary Nelson in a car bomb in Lurgan on 15 March 1999 was a brutal and shocking act of violence. The murder was not only abhorrent in itself, it also represented a fundamental attack on those committed to the vindication of human rights and on the legal system itself.</P>
      <P>Since Rosemary's murder, the Government has repeatedly emphasised that the investigation must be thorough, transparent and independent, and be seen to be such. The investigation is now led by Deputy Chief Constable Colin Port, of the Norfolk police, and I would again strongly call upon all those with relevant information to assist the investigation into this horrendous murder in every appropriate way.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department keep in very close contact with the British authorities in relation to the investigation. They also maintain close contact with human rights organisations both at home and abroad, with the Nelson family and with other interested parties.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious that a year has gone by since Rosemary's death and sincerely hope that the investigation will be successful in bringing the perpetrators to justice. It is vital that the truth in relation to all of the circumstances surrounding Rosemary's death be established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continues to be concerned at the situation in Belarus.</P>
      <P>Since Alexander Lukashenka took office as President of Belarus in 1994 a strong, authoritarian regime has been established. Referendums in May 1995 and November 1996, the legitimacy of which is contested, were used to dismiss Parliament, extend the powers and term of office of the President, and place restrictions on the media and political parties. The present Parliament in Belarus is composed exclusively of supporters of Lukashenka. The latter's democratic mandate as President, although extended by himself to 2001, ran out on 20 July 1999. However, in trying to promote democratic reform in Belarus there is little alternative to continuing to deal with Lukashenka.</P>
      <P>From the outset, the international community made clear its rejection of a non-democratic Belarus, whilst continuing to make every effort to encourage the reform process. In January 1997, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe suspended the special guest status of Belarus. In January this year, it was decided to maintain the exclusion of Belarus from the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, because of its serious shortcomings concerning democratic pluralism and the continued use of the death penalty. As Chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, Ireland continues to urge Belarus to avail of the resources of the Council of Europe to promote democratisation.</P>
      <P>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe has also been involved in efforts to promote democracy in Belarus. As in the case of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE does not recognise the current Parliament in Belarus, but the organisation maintains its efforts to encourage reform there. In 1998 an OSCE advisory and monitoring group was established in Minsk with the aim of resolving differences between the Lukashenka administration and opposition elements. The group has been active in organising seminars and workshops on democracy issues, which have been attended by government, opposition and media representatives.</P>
      <P>The European Union strongly desires a close and co-operative relationship with Belarus. The Union's readiness to provide all practical assistance to Belarus in implementing political and economic reform, has been made clear. However, it has also been emphasised that it is essential for Belarus to demonstrate its commitment to democratic principles and parliamentary democracy. Until steps in this direction are taken, measures adopted by the Union to limit ministerial contact with Belarus and put on hold the development of contractual relations with the Union remain in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second half of 1999, there were some improvements in the situation in Belarus. There was agreement in July on political dialogue between the Government and opposition. Agree<Col N="1151" /> ment was also reached before the November OSCE summit on opposition access to the media. Another welcome move was the release from detention of former Prime Minister Chigir in November. However, the dialogue process has not materialised. In addition, an electoral code, which grants the ruling party a monopoly on all election commissions &ndash; the bodies which select candidates &ndash; was passed by Parliament on 24 January. The campaign regulation contained in this code is contrary to democratic principles and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. A parliamentary troika consisting of members from the OSCE, the European Parliament and the Council of Europe visited Belarus in early March. The mandate of the team is to monitor the democratic efforts of the government and the opposition ahead of the elections scheduled for next October. The group met with President Lushakenka and parliamentary deputies as well as members of the opposition and media organisations. Following the discussions, the Presidential administration indicated that electoral laws might be changed, however details are still awaited.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to work actively both bilaterally and with partners in the Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE to encourage the Belarus authorities to resolve their outstanding human rights and democratisation issues and, in particular, to take steps to ensure that the Parliamentary elections to be held next autumn are free and fair.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 85 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of 29 February 2000, Ireland was owed IR£9.87 million for the cost of providing Irish personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions abroad. The only missions for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in <Col N="1152" /> East Timor, UNTAET. During 1999, the UN repaid arrears of approximately £5.5 million to Ireland, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>Continuous efforts are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to recover from the United Nations the moneys owed. The Department, through the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations, makes ongoing representations to the United Nations headquarters in this regard.</P>
    <P>The financial crisis which hinders the UN from paying outstanding moneys is a direct result of the failure by many member states, in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. This situation has resulted in a serious day-to-day UN cash flow problem. Ireland and its EU partners have strenuously argued that all UN member states must honour their financial obligations.</P>
    <P>The US is the major debtor and any improvement in its arrears situation would ease the situation considerably. We discussed this issue at a meeting in Washington on St. Patrick's Day with the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright. She underlined the commitment of the United States Administration, on the basis of a plan agreed with Congress, to deal with the arrears problem. The plan also contains proposals for reform of the UN financing system. Detailed negotiations on these matters are under way at the United Nations and Ireland, together with our EU partners, will participate constructively in the process.</P>
    <P>A successful outcome to the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries. In the meantime, I can assure the House that Ireland's Permanent Mission to the UN in New York will continue to actively pursue the outstanding amounts of arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has primary responsibility for co-ordinating Ireland's policy concerning the World Trade Organisation and the prospects for a new round of global trade negotiations. The Department of Foreign Affairs, at headquarters and through the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in Geneva and the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels remains closely involved in the preparation and implementation of this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization, which was held in Seattle from 30 November to 4 December 1999, failed to reach agreement on the launching of a new round of global trade negotiations. The meeting was officially suspended but looking at matters realistically, I see little chance of it being resumed <Col N="1154" /> and what is likely is that in due course a new &ndash; fourth &ndash; ministerial meeting will be convened. Whatever the reasons for the failure of the Seattle meeting &ndash; and I see no point in attempting to attribute or apportion any blame for that to the different participants, each of whom went to Seattle determined to defend and promote their particular interests &ndash; what is important now is to ensure that momentum is not lost and that negotiations continue with a view to launching a new round as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, remains committed to the conclusions which were agreed at the meeting of the General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 11 October last, and which were formally adopted on 26 October. The conclusions propose a broad-based comprehensive round of trade negotiations, to be concluded within a relatively short period of, say, three years. Such a comprehensive round would offer the opportunity of achieving a broad range of objectives of benefit to all WTO members in terms of further liberalisation and expansion of trade, increased transparency and predictability and equal opportunities for all WTO members to obtain results on the basis of balanced negotiations. The European Union will continue to advocate such a course.</P>
    <P>The EU's policy with regard to a new global round attaches particular significance to ensuring that it would respond to the special interests and concerns of developing countries and that a development agenda should be reflected in all areas of negotiation. In Seattle, the EU gave a commitment to promoting duty and quota free market access for essentially all products imported from developing countries. Ireland strongly supported this policy and looks forward to its early implementation. Agriculture in general and food security in particular are key issues for developing countries. The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to pay particular attention to the needs of the developing countries in the talks and discussions which I hope will lead to the launching of a new global round.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to supporting the needs of the developing countries is evidenced in that we were among the first countries to sign, at the Seattle ministerial meeting, an agreement to the establishment of the advisory centre in Geneva on WTO law for developing countries. The Agreement was signed on our behalf by Minister of State, Mr. Kitt who led Ireland's delegation at the conference. Ireland thus became a founder member of the centre and we will contribute $2.25 million to it over five years. The centre will provide invaluable advice and assistance for developing countries &ndash; in particular the least developed &ndash;  in defending their trade rights and availing of the dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO. In supporting this project we have underlined in a practical way our view that the Millennium trade round should reflect closely the needs and interests of the developing world and <Col N="1155" /> should facilitate the integration of developing countries into the world trade system.</P>
    <P>Under existing WTO agreements, members are committed to certain follow-on reviews and negotiations across the so-called built-in-agenda topics covering services, agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property, TRIPS, technical barriers to trade, Government procurement, investment measures, TRIMS and textiles. Also under existing agreements, negotiations in these areas must begin this year.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a general global round of trade negotiations, the immediate focus within the WTO lies accordingly on these built-in-agenda issues. Negotiations in these areas will be conducted through the existing WTO groups in Geneva under the direction of the General Council. As no negotiating guidelines issued from Seattle, the negotiations will be based on existing WTO legal texts and are without specific time deadlines.</P>
    <P>On agriculture, there is a legal obligation under Article 20 of the agreement on agriculture, that negotiations should commence now. The negotiations will be handled by the WTO committee on agriculture meeting in special session. The Committee on Agriculture is in fact meeting in Geneva yesterday and today.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 56, and 148 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the current accession process was launched by the 15 EU member states, the ten central and eastern European states and Cyprus on 30 March 1998. The following day, actual negotiations were inaugurated with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus. These countries are often referred to as the &ldquo;ins&rdquo;. Negotiations have continued with these countries since then on a policy chapter basis.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a preparatory process for negotiations continued with the other original applicants, the so-called &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;&ndash; Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. Malta joined this group in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on recommendations from the Com<Col N="1156" /> mission, the Helsinki European Council on 10 December 1999 decided that the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;, including Malta, had reached such a level of preparation that accession negotiations could be opened in 2000. These negotiations began formally in Brussels on 15 February 2000. Actual substantive negotiations will start this month. It was also decided that the accession negotiation process for all 12 accession countries should be on an equal footing and that each should proceed on the basis of its own merits and level of preparedness. This will ensure that the new member states are capable of functioning effectively in the highly competitive European market.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council affirmed that the European Union should be in a position to &ldquo;welcome new member states from the end of 2002, as soon as they have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership&rdquo; and once the negotiating process has been successfully completed.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki European Council also granted candidate status and an intensified pre-negotiation relationship with the EU to Turkey. Turkey will now benefit from a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms. Significantly, this will entail a political dialogue with a particular emphasis on human rights. Actual accession negotiations cannot begin with Turkey until that country fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria. These rigorous criteria of democracy, human rights, protection of minorities, and the rule of law, are the same for Turkey as for all other applicant countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a strong supporter of the current enlargement process for strategic reasons of peace and for economic reasons. We look forward to welcoming the new member states, including the Republic of Hungary, when they have satisfactorily completed their negotiations and have demonstrated their ability to assume the obligations of membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to Question Nos. 19 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The Middle East peace process was relaunched with the signing of the Sharm-el-Sheikh memorandum last September between President Arafat and PM Barak. This memorandum provided for implementation of existing agreements under the Wye River accord and the resumption of final status negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then a number of measures have been implemented, such as transfer of territory from <Col N="1157" /> Israeli to Palestinian control, release of Palestinian prisoners, and the opening of a safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank. Serious difficulties, however, have arisen in each of these areas.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the final status negotiations will have to address very complex problems, such as the status of Jerusalem, water, settlements, borders, and return of refugees.</P>
    <P>The difficulties encountered led to a standstill in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. In particular, there are disputes over what territory is to be transferred and over continued Israeli settlement building. In consequence, the target date of 13 February for concluding an interim framework agreement was not met. This was a further serious setback. The combination of these factors undoubtedly led to a loss of confidence in the negotiating atmosphere, particularly on the Palestinian side.</P>
    <P>This stalemate has now been broken and the Israelis and Palestinians resumed negotiations in Washington this week. This is a very hopeful sign, although it has to be said that the extent and complexity of the issues remaining to be addressed means that the deadline of 13 September for conclusion of the negotiations remains a highly ambitious one.</P>
    <P>We wish both parties every success in their efforts. At the same time, we would call on them to refrain from any acts which would complicate the negotiations further; to take all necessary measures to rebuild mutual confidence; to show a readiness to make concessions; and to focus their attention on the ultimate goal of lasting peace and stability in the region.</P>
    <P>Negotiations also resumed in January on Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in Syria and the establishment of peace between the two countries. These negotiations have since stalled. The recent escalation of violence in Lebanon has been particularly unhelpful. Nevertheless, there is a good prospect that the talks will resume in a near future. It is generally thought that the problems facing these negotiations will prove less difficult and that there should be a successful outcome within a reasonable timeframe. This would greatly improve the prospects for an agreed Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Again, we wish the parties every success in their negotiations.</P>

      <P>In November 1999 Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash agreed to take part in UN-sponsored indirect or &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; talks with Cypriot President Glafeos Clerides. These proximity talks started on December 3. A second round of talks was held <Col N="1158" /> from 31 January to 8 February. The purpose of these two rounds of talks was to prepare the groundwork for comprehensive negotiations. Four core issues are on the table in these discussions &ndash; security, territory, property including compensation and distribution of powers.</P>
      <P>Relationships between the two sides have steadily improved since Greece responded very generously to Turkish humanitarian requirements following the August 1999 earthquake and Turkey sent aid following a subsequent earthquake in Greece. In December, Greece ended its veto on Turkey acquiring the status of a candidate for EU membership.</P>
      <P>The rapprochement has reached a new level with the signing by Greece and Turkey of several accords in recent months on issues such as illegal immigration and terrorism, organised crime, the environment, double taxation and tourism. The two sides have also discussed the possibility of mounting a joint bid for the 2008 European football championships.</P>
      <P>Talks on the Cyprus problem are to restart in New York in May. The UN mediator Alvaro De Soto has confirmed that the next round like the previous ones, will be based on indirect meetings.</P>
      <P>The Government fully supports the efforts of the United Nations to achieve a political solution to the Cyprus question. We believe the UN framework of a bi-zonal, bi-communal, federal approach remains the appropriate one for an eventual settlement.</P>
      <P>The Government also believes that the prospect of accession by Cyprus to the EU provides both the incentive and the opportunity for serious efforts to find a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus question. Ireland will continue to give every support to the efforts of the UN to advance the process towards a political settlement and we will continue to work actively to assist Cyprus on its path towards EU accession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is completely opposed to the use of the death penalty and, accordingly, aims at universal abolition. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>Ireland along with its EU partners has raised the use of the death penalty frequently with the US authorities. Recently a general <i>demarche </i>was carried out on behalf of the EU by the EU troika at Ambassador level, to the US Under Secretary for Global Affairs, Mr. Frank Loy, in order to formally deliver an EU memorandum on death penalty. At that meeting the use of the death penalty both at state and federal level was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> The Under Secretary pointed out that as a federal country each state can decide when and how to implement capital punishment.</P>
    <P>We are particularly concerned that in the US, where more than 600 people have been executed since the reinstatement of death penalty since 1976, as many as 81 people in 21 states have been found innocent and removed from death row. Another death row prisoner &ndash; Mr. Joseph Nahume Green &ndash; was acquitted and released in Florida this week.</P>
    <P>We therefore welcome moves such as the moratorium imposed in the US State of Illinois on all pending executions to review death penalty procedures. We hope this is a step on the road to the abolition of the death penalty in all 38 states and at federal level. The EU Troika, acting on behalf of the EU, has requested all US governors to follow the example of the Governor of Illinois.</P>
    <P>We will continue with our EU partners to press for total abolition of the death penalty. Discussion is at an advanced stage within the EU on tabling a resolution on the question of the death penalty at the current session 56 session of the UN Commission on human rights. Ireland is working to ensure maximum support for this resolution.</P>

      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the &ldquo;Western European and Others&rdquo; group of states for the two-year term 2001-02. The election, which will take place in October 2000, is being contested by two other candidates: Norway and Italy. Turkey withdrew its candidacy on 10 February. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those states present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 125 states will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>Former Minister Andrews strongly promoted Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions and the Minister for Foreign Affairs intends to continue and extend the level of lobbying activity as the campaign intensifies, in this, its final year.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government, as well as a number of Ministers of State, have also promoted the Irish candidacy in their contacts with other administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is a strongly contested election, I am reluctant to indicate the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage. Let me say <Col N="1160" /> simply that our candidacy continues to attract a high level of support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 23, 60 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The question of European security and defence policy is the subject of continuing discussion within the EU on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The focus of these EU discussions is the Petersberg Tasks, and not mutual defence commitments.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for the Petersberg Tasks. This target, known as a headline goal, which the member states aim to meet by the year 2003, is to be able to deploy fifty to sixty thousand personnel within sixty days and to be able to sustain this deployment for one year. This would equate roughly to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>What Helsinki agreed upon was a capabilities target. As the Helsinki European Council conclusions make clear, this does not imply the creation of a European army. Nor does it alter the fact that participation in the Petersberg Tasks under the Treaty of Amsterdam is on a voluntary basis, and is a matter for sovereign decision in each and every case.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council, with participation as appropriate by Defence Ministers, was mandated at Helsinki to take forward the elaboration of this target and to develop a method of consultation through which this target could be met, and progress reviewed. Member states will also use existing defence planning procedures which, in the case of Ireland and the other neutral and non-allied EU member states, would include the planning and review process of the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> The improvement of EU decision-making structures was also addressed at Helsinki, so that the EU can take effective and informed decisions on the Petersberg Tasks when necessary. Final decisions in this area are not foreseen until the end of this year at the earliest. The Helsinki conclusions make clear that the Council decides upon policy relevant to Union involvement in all phases and aspects of crisis management, including decisions to carry out the Petersberg Tasks in accordance with Article 23 of the EU Treaty. EU-led Petersberg Tasks will clearly be under the authority of the General Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>On Monday of this week, the General Affairs Council considered these issues. Defence Ministers of the 15 member states, including the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, participated in the Council's consideration of the issue of capabilities for the Petersberg Tasks. The Council had a discussion on progress in follow up to Helsinki, addressing both the military and civilian tracks of the issue. In addition to considering a draft Presidency progress report to the Lisbon European Council, the General Affairs Council considered the way forward for elaborating the headline and capability goals set at Helsinki. The Council also considered the establishment of a committee for civilian crisis management, with a view to reaching a decision on the establishment of such a committee by the European Council in June. Ireland attaches importance to progress in this important area of civilian crisis management.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of EU-WEU merger, following the Cologne European Council of last June, the EU has drawn a distinction between, on the one hand, inclusion within the EU of the crisis management functions that exist in the Western European Union; and on the other hand, full integration of the Western European Union as an institution into the EU. Bringing into the EU framework some of the Western European Union's peacekeeping and crisis management structures could be useful in enhancing the EU's ability to address the Petersberg Tasks. But full integration of the Western European Union into the EU raises the issue of the Western European Union's Article V clause &ndash; this is the automatic mutual defence commitment which binds the members of the Western European Union only. This clause would not be compatible with our military neutrality. Ireland, other neutrals, and indeed some other partners see no case for bringing the Western European Union Article V clause into the EU debate. It is not central to what the EU is trying to do, which is to focus on peacekeeping and crisis management, and not issues of mutual defence.</P>

      <P>Waterways Ireland is one of the six North-South implementation bodies, established under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, which commenced operation on 2 December 1999, the same day that power was devolved to the new Northern Assembly.</P>
      <P>While the Assembly and Executive were suspended on 11 February, the agreement between the two Governments establishing the Implementation Bodies has not been amended and, therefore, all of the bodies, including Waterways Ireland, continue to discharge their functions as set out in that agreement and in the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>However, the suspension of the Executive and Assembly clearly has implications for the operation of the Implementation Bodies, not least because of the fact that the North-South Ministerial Council cannot meet in the absence of Northern Ministers. While each Implementation Body has a clear operational remit, they take their overall policy direction from the NSMC, which also has a range of other powers and duties in respect of the bodies.</P>
      <P>The two Governments will continue to keep the situation under close review, in the light of progress towards the restoration of the Assembly and Executive, which remains our highest priority.</P>

      <P>The human rights situation in Algeria will be considered at the forthcoming 56th Session of the UN Commission of Human Rights, when the European Union will renew its call to Algeria to co-operate with the human rights machinery of the United Nations, and in particular to accept a visit by the UN special rapporteurs.</P>
      <P>The latest development in the ongoing EU dialogue with Algeria is that the Algerian authorities have advised the Presidency that they have undertaken to keep the Commission of Human Rights informed on a regular basis about cases of persons reported to have disappeared in Algeria.</P>
      <P>In recent days, the Algerian authorities have responded to the démarches made by the European Union and furnished information to the EU Presidency about disappearance cases, and are to follow up with further information.</P>
      <P>We remain patiently hopeful that the amnesty introduced by President Bouteflika will provide for a peaceful resolution to the tragedy in Algeria. The amnesty has helped to improve the security situation significantly. The acceptance of the amnesty by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which has since formally moved to disband under an agreement with the government is a positive step towards an end to the years of conflict. Nevertheless, we are concerned at reports of continued clashes between the military and Islamist militias and official estimates of up to 400 deaths since the amnesty deadline passed on 13 January.</P>
      <P>Algeria is now entering a delicate phase of economic and social reform and modernisation on which there is not unanimity, and this could give rise to further tension within the society. As part of its dialogue with Algeria, the EU has encouraged perseverance with necessary reforms and modernisation, and has offered constructive assistance through the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, including in the area of judicial reform. The EU is prepared to negotiate Algeria's closer association with its market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 41, and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Since it was established in 1974, Ireland Aid has had a long history of working in partnership with Irish NGOs and missionary orders. It has recognised that NGOs, most of which are in operation a number of decades, and our missionary orders have a strong tradition of working with the poorest people in developing countries. NGOs are therefore one valuable means of channelling aid for poverty reduction, which is the primary focus of the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
      <P>The partnership between Ireland Aid and NGOs is intended to benefit both the NGOs, through financial support, and the bilateral aid programme, through the experience and local contacts of NGOs. The partnership recognises the close contacts which many NGOs have with local communities and the potential this creates for reaching the poor and building their capacity to determine the course of their own development.</P>
      <P>Funding to NGOs is available under a number of different schemes. These include the NGO co-financing scheme, the human rights and democratisation scheme and the emergency relief and rehabilitation assistance scheme. Funding to NGOs has increased in recent years from £3.4 million, 8.4% of total aid, in 1992 to £20.7 million, 15% of total aid, in 1998. The figures for 1999 will be available shortly. However, in the context of an expanding aid budget, there is room for improvement on the proportion of ODA channelled through NGOs.</P>
      <P>The number of NGOs receiving funding from Ireland Aid continues to rise. In 1998, for example, under the NGO co-financing scheme alone, around 350 NGOs received funding for their development activities. This figure includes over 90 Irish NGOs and missionary orders active in developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five of the largest Irish NGOs &ndash; Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Self Help Development International and Christian Aid &ndash; receive an annual block grant from Ireland Aid for longer term development projects. My Department is currently in discussion with these NGOs concerning putting these funding arrangements on a multi-annual basis, which would facilitate them in better planning of development activities and provide greater assurance regarding funding. It would also help these NGOs strengthen their relationships with local partners. Existing block grant provisions are being reviewed to take account of any additional criteria, including reporting, monitoring and evaluation, which may be necessary in a multi-annual context. Decisions on increases in development funding should also <Col N="1165" /> reflect issues such as capacity, the proportion of its overall funding which a particular NGO devotes to development, and the strategic focus of individual organisations and programmes.</P>
    <P>Some NGOs have raised the possibility of a specific NGO budget line. Minister of State O'Donnell is favourably disposed towards such a proposal, and is considering this and other matters in the context of a current review of the expanding aid programme. Proposals will shortly be brought to Cabinet in this regard.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of whether military tactics used by Russia amount to <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a crime against humanity, the Government is not aware of any evidence advanced by the international community which would prove that Russia has engaged in a deliberate policy to destroy the civilian population of Chechnya and that it used disproportionate force to that end. Nevertheless, the result of Russia's military actions have been appalling for the civilian population caught up in the conflict. Ireland condemns the military actions taken without due regard for the safety of civilians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is actively supporting efforts aimed at securing lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone. The nine years of civil war in the country have caused untold suffering to the people there.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners, we welcomed the ceasefire agreed in July of last year in Lomé, and have called on all parties to the agreement to fully implement its provisions, and observe human rights and international humanitarian law. With our EU partners, we continue to be supportive of ongoing efforts by the UN to implement the agreement, notably through the establishment of the UN Mission in Sierra Leone. In this regard, we welcome the Security Council Resolution of 7 February authorising the expansion of the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). However, we are concerned at the report of the Secretary General of 7 March, stating that despite some progress in the establishment of certain bodies under the Lomé Agreement, progress in other areas of the peace process remains very slow and that the security situation continues to be volatile. In particular, we share the grave concern expressed in the report about continuing human rights abuses in Sierra Leone, as well as reports of a serious humanitarian situation, especially in those parts of the country where UNAMSIL access is being obstructed. This is unacceptable, given the commitments made by all parties to the Lomé Peace Agreement to ensure protection and promotion of human rights and unhindered access throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of our ongoing bilateral support, <Col N="1167" /> Ireland continues to commit significant funds to the international humanitarian effort for the suffering people of Sierra Leone. Last year in response to the crisis, Ireland Aid provided £350,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance. This aid was channelled via the World Food Programme and the Irish NGOs Concern and GOAL for their respective programmes. So far this year Ir£150,000 has been allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for its resettlement and rehabilitation programme. In addition, the European Union is providing support to Sierra Leone both by way of emergency assistance through the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), and longer term support programmes through the European Development Fund (EDF). ECHO has provided almost 19 million euros in emergency humanitarian assistance over the last 12 months. A further package of five million euros is currently being implemented. In December 1999, the EDF management committee approved funding for an 8.9 million euros structural adjustment support <Col N="1168" /> programme aimed at assisting the Government of Sierra Leone in its post-conflict recovery reforms.</P>
    <P>Along with our EU and UN partners, we will continue to support diplomatic efforts aimed at consolidating a lasting and peaceful resolution to the conflict, and to provide appropriate humanitarian relief to the vulnerable civilian population, in addition to maintaining pressure on all parties to fully observe human rights and international humanitarian law.</P>

Though the full extent of the outcome is not yet clear, as run-off elections must still be held next month, the substantial public mandate for genuine change by the people of Iran will clearly strengthen President Khatami's position, and assist him in overcoming opposition to his efforts to advance the programme of reforms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations, in line with the commitment to <Col N="1169" /> this end in An Action Programme for the Millennium. In the recent review of the action programme, the Government committed itself to support the strengthening of the capacity of the international community, in particular through the UN and the renewal process that will follow the Millennium Assembly, to make effective humanitarian interventions to halt conflict and suffering.</P>
      <P>The reform issue has been pursued vigorously by the Government and was raised again in the address of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs to the UN General Assembly on 25 September 1999. While a number of important reforms have taken place, particularly in the re-organisation of the UN's role in the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, the overall pace of reform has not, unfortunately, been as we would wish. We very much hope that the Millennium Summit and Assembly later this year will provide fresh impetus in the reform process. We look forward to an action-oriented outcome which will strengthen the organisation as it enters the new century.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, presented a reform agenda for the United Nations to be implemented on the basis of a two-track process. The first track related to managerial initiatives and decisions falling within his authority. The second track involved a longer-term programme of reform to include fundamental proposals that could only be decided intergovernmentally, that is, by the representatives of the member states meeting in the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The track I proposals have been substantially agreed and are being implemented. They include the establishment and implementation of the UN development assistance framework under which UN agencies involved in development assistance will co-operate more closely at country level in an effort to avoid duplication. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs replaced the Department of Humanitarian Affairs. Ireland, with other donor countries, actively supported the setting up of this new UN office.</P>
      <P>The track II reform proposals on which progress has been made include the establishment of a senior management group under the chairmanship of the Secretary General and the creation of a new post of Deputy Secretary General with important responsibilities in the development field. Ms Louise Frechette of Canada was appointed to this position in January 1998. A substantial number of reform proposals requiring General Assembly approval have not yet been endorsed. These include important proposals in the development area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the UN Secretary General in his efforts to bring about a renewed, reformed and more vigorous UN. This is essential to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and <Col N="1170" /> economic development. Ireland and its EU partners have sought to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost-cutting exercise but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues is the question of Security Council reform. The Charter of the United Nations provides, in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the organisation, that its member states confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group (open to all UN member states) to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council. The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the Council's working methods and its decision-making procedures including, crucially, the use of the veto.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged Council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the Council as non-permanent members. As the Deputies are aware, Ireland is a candidate for membership of the Council for 2001-02.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the Council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent five, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto, and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the Council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>I regret that the working group has not yet been unable to report any consensual progress to the General Assembly. I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in these negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland was one of the core group of countries which led the negotiation of the mine ban convention, and was one of the first three countries to ratify the treaty, on the day it opened for signature, 3 December 1997.</P>
      <P>Since then, we have maintained our commitment by advocating the convention's full implementation and seeking to secure the signatures &ndash; and ratification &ndash; of all states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One indication of our commitment was the participation at the first meeting of states parties to the convention in Maputo in May last year of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, one of the few Foreign Ministers to attend. In the preparations for that meeting and <Col N="1172" /> during the meeting itself, Ireland was actively engaged in the drafting of the meeting's final declaration and the programme of work for the period to the next meeting of states parties which will be held in September this year.</P>
    <P>Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have participated in the intersessional work undertaken on foot of the meeting of states parties, most notably in seeking to develop clarity in relation to devices which might function as anti-personnel mines; this work is crucial to ensuring that the convention's goals are not undermined.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also given its full support to the development of the landmine monitor Report, a civil-society based initiative to monitor the convention's implementation. In addition to providing over £100,000 towards the cost of producing the first report, Ireland hosted, in September 1998, the meeting of NGO's which launched the system. Since the launch of the first annual report at the first meeting of states parties last year, we have continued to offer our support to the initiative, participating once again this year in the meetings designed to assist researchers in producing their country reports. The second report of the monitor will be issued at the second meeting of states parties in September.</P>
    <P>The amount of assistance which we have provided to mine action, including mine awareness, demining and victim assistance, has increased substantially over the years. Last year Irish contributions amounted to £1,516,000. Projects were funded in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Angola and Somalia and included demining, mine awareness and victim support programmes.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the role of Canada, another member of the core group of countries, for its efforts to achieve the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines. Canada remains very active in this area. Canada is able, however, to devote significantly greater resources to disarmament work than we can. Much as we might wish to appoint a special official at ambassadorial level to promote these activities, the level of available resources would not permit this.</P>

    <P>Ireland is not currently a member of the UN Commission on Human Rights. However we will be attending the session in Geneva as an observer. It is expected that members of the Commission will table a resolution on Chechnya. Ireland could support an appropriate resolution on Chechnya aimed at helping in an effective manner the efforts to press Russia towards a political settlement and a credible investigation of human rights abuses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 45, 58, 82 and 163 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware from previous answers and comments to the House, official <Col N="1174" /> development assistance, ODA, has grown hugely in volume terms in the 1990s from £40 million in 1992 to £178 million in 1999, a fact that has been acknowledged by our donor peers and our partner countries in Africa. In addition, a review of the aid programme carried out in 1999 by the OECD verified the Irish commitment to quality and sustainability.</P>
    <P>However, it is acknowledged that our progress to the UN target has fallen short of what was intended when this Government took office. Aid allocations since 1996 were negotiated on forecasts for GNP growth, forecasts which turned out to be significantly less than actual GNP growth. Additionally, the introduction in 1999 of a new system for calculating GNP had the effect of holding back further the rate of growth of ODA in GNP terms.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concern among NGOs and others interested in aid at this development, a concern voiced in the Reality of Aid 2000 report.</P>
    <P>In the address on 5 February referred to by Deputy Quinn, the Taoiseach indicated that, in response to the problem in making progress to the UN target, a review was under way of the question of aid allocations and aid management and that the review would lead to proposals being brought to Government for consideration. That is still the case. The review is at a more advanced stage with proposals under final consideration.</P>
    <P>The review was initiated in my Department to examine the question of the ODA target and all related issues, such as the need to augment aid management to cope with current and future growth and to maintain the programme's reputation, referred to above, for quality aid.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that aid allocations be put on a legislative footing, I am not convinced this is necessary or practical.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I am confident that the outcome of the review of the provision for development aid and of the Government's consideration of the matter will ensure steady and substantial annual progress towards the UN target.</P>

      <P>The Government together with our EU partners, is following closely the situation in Angola , including the significant developments registered on the military front in recent months. In January of this year, we restated our conviction that there is no alternative to a political settlement in bringing peace and stability to the country and people of Angola.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with our EU partners, the Government has reiterated that UNITA bears the prime responsibility for the war in Angola. We have <Col N="1175" /> expressed concern about UNITA's persistent defiance of UN security council resolutions, and its failure to comply with key provisions of the Lusaka Protocol. We fully support the Security Council sanctions, which aim to promote peaceful settlement by limiting UNITA's ability to pursue its objectives by military means. In this context we welcome the report this month by the panel of experts established by the UN Security Council on the violation of Security Council sanctions against UNITA. We have urged UNITA to cease military activities and to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The EU continues to encourage the Angolan Government to create a political, social and economic environment for democracy which will foster respect for the rule of law in Angola. In this regard, we have stressed that the Government has a special responsibility for the promotion of human rights, democratic principles, good governance and the strengthening of a free civil society, including in areas controlled by UNITA.</P>
    <P>We have also called on the Government of Angola, as a signatory of the Ottawa Convention, and on UNITA, to immediately cease mine-laying activities in the country. In addition, we have expressed concern at the recent fighting between Angolan armed forces and UNITA across international borders in the area, and have stressed the importance of stability and interstate co-operation in the region.</P>
    <P>Together with our European partners, we will be ready to consider how to assist the Government of Angola in facing the challenges of rebuilding and reconstructing the country within a democratic environment, and will continue to give particular attention to the alleviation of the suffering of the Angolan population affected by the conflict.</P>

    <P>Ireland fulfils its obligation to promote observance of universal human rights standards through participation in the relevant international fora: the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the <Col N="1176" /> OSCE.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>The systematic violation of human rights in Burma is a matter of profound concern to the Government and to the EU. The continuing refusal of the military regime to respect the results of the democratic elections which were held there, or to address the findings of various UN and other inquiries, means that the situation remains unacceptable. The regime has, moreover, failed to act on the recommendations of a number of resolutions adopted by both the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly of the United Nations. Notwithstanding this, these concerns will be raised again at the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which has just begun, and I expect this to lead to a further resolution which should address comprehensively this ongoing problem in detail.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the House last month that progress will be made only when the military regime enters into meaningful dialogue with Madam Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of the National League for Democracy. The EU has sought to persuade the Burmese military regime to engage in dialogue with the National League for Democracy by suggesting initial practical steps and confidence building measures. To date, however, the response of the regime has been disappointing, and we will take this into account when considering the updating and extension of the EU Common Position on Burma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Madam Aung San Suu Kyi on being awarded the Freedom of Dublin. As many <Col N="1177" /> recent tributes have shown, this is in recognition of her courage and determination on behalf of the Burmese people. It is to be regretted that she was not able to come in person, for reasons which we all understand, to accept this signal honour. I am sure the House will join me in expressing the hope that she will be able to come to Dublin at an early date.</P>

      <P>The lack of political progress towards a lasting peace and the tragic humanitarian situation in Sudan are a source of deep concern to the Government. Together with our EU partners and other members of the international community, we have called on the parties to the conflict to proceed to a permanent and comprehensive humanitarian ceasefire and to resume the political talks process at an early date. As an active member of the IGAD &ndash; Intergovernmental Authority on Development &ndash; Partners' Forum, the Government fully supports and encourages the efforts to bring about progress in the peace talks, and reaffirms the importance of a constructive dialogue aimed at stability and co-operation in the country itself, as well as in the wider region.</P>
      <P>With our EU partners, we have welcomed the recent steps towards normalisation of bilateral relations between Sudan and its neighbouring states, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda, and look forward to further steps to enhance the prospects of peace, stability and co-operation in the region. In November 1999, the EU renewed its dialogue with the Government of Sudan. With our EU partners, we are monitoring closely progress in the national reconciliation process and internal developments, including the issue of self-determination for the people of the south, and the effects of the state of emergency declared by the Government of Sudan.</P>
      <P>The Government has been consistent in its support of the people of Sudan over recent years and in parallel to its efforts to break the current political impasse, it continues to provide emergency humanitarian relief for the suffering people of southern Sudan. In 1999, Ireland contributed more than Ir£1million in emergency and rehabilitation assistance. Overall emergency assistance from the Government to Sudan amounts to Ir£358,000 so far this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We remain deeply concerned at the constraints imposed by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association (SPLM/SRRA) on international NGOs carrying out humanitarian work in southern Sudan. Earlier this month, together with our EU partners, we urged the SPLM-SRRA to resume negotiations with the NGOs as soon as possible <Col N="1178" /> to allow vital humanitarian operations to continue unhindered in accordance with international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to respond on a humanitarian and political level in concert with other like-minded countries. We fully recognise that humanitarian assistance cannot be a substitute for a meaningful and inclusive political solution. Such a solution will require full observance of the principles of democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law throughout Sudan regardless of ethnicity, gender or religion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 77  together.</P>
      <P>At our meeting on Monday and Tuesday of this week, EU Foreign Ministers reviewed EU policy towards human rights in China, particularly in light of the EU-China human rights dialogue and in preparation for this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>The importance of the EU-China Human rights dialogue, which allows joint work towards the promotion and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in China, was reiterated. Ministers agreed that dialogue is acceptable only if progress is achieved and reflected on the ground. While welcoming China's stated willingness to co-operate with UN human rights mechanisms, we regretted that positive steps taken by China at international level have not been matched by tangible progress in the human rights situation in the country. Ministers expressed concern at, <i>inter alia</i>, the continuing and widespread restrictions on fundamental freedoms, the policy of imposing harsh sentences on pro-democracy activists and taking severe measures against certain minority groups, the number of arrests and the harshness of sentences passed against followers of the Falun Gong and the restrictions on members of the Christian Church and other religious groups. The frequent use of the death penalty was also noted with distress.</P>
      <P>Given these concerns, we agreed to engage in a process of review of the sustainability of the dialogue, with a view to a more focused and result-oriented approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> The United States will table a draft resolution on the human rights situation in China at the 56th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which is currently under way. As has been stated in response to previous questions on this matter, Ireland is co-ordinating with our EU partners in deciding our approach to the resolution. This matter was carefully considered at the Council meeting earlier this week and it was agreed that the EU approach would be outlined at a later date at the Commission.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding improvements, particularly of social, economic and cultural rights, detailed in the White Paper published by the Chinese Government, titled Fifty Years of Progress in China's Human Rights, Ireland and our EU partners continue to have concerns about human rights in China. We will continue to keep EU policy on China under regular review, including at the Commission on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to prisoners released in Northern Ireland under the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for releases under the agreement in this jurisdiction lies with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement committed both Governments to put in place mechanisms to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of prisoners convicted of offences relating to the conflict in Northern Ireland. Prisoners affiliated to organisations which are not maintaining a complete ceasefire do not benefit from the arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act, 1998, gives effect in Northern Ireland to that part of the Agreement dealing with the release of prisoners. Under the provisions of the Act, sentence review commissioners decide whether a prisoner is eligible for release and specify a release date.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act came into force on 28 July 1998. Since then, 322 prisoners have been released under its provisions. Of these, 97 are life sentence prisoners, 51 loyalist, 44 republican and two others, while 225 are fixed term prisoners, 96 loyalist, 121 republican and eight others.</P>
      <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland recently suspended the licence of one of the persons included in the total above, and the matter is now being reviewed by the sentence review commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the sentence review commissioners have issued declarations setting early release <Col N="1180" /> dates for a further 108 prisoners. Of these, there are 64 republicans, 43 loyalists and 1 other. This number may increase as outstanding applications are dealt with.</P>

      <P>As has been made clear previously in reply to questions on this case, it is the Government's belief that abuses of human rights in any country are of concern to all. The perpetrators of all human rights abuses should be brought to justice in accordance with law. Throughout the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, Ireland strongly condemned the violations of human rights carried out by the regime. As a practical expression of our sympathy with the victims of those violations, we welcomed Chilean refugees into Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that I am not in a position to comment on the specific case of the extradition proceedings against General Pinochet which was a matter for the judicial authorities in the countries involved in those proceedings. The question of whether he will now be sent for trial following his return to Chile is a matter for the judicial authorities there. President Lagos, who took office earlier this month, has clearly indicated that he fully respects the independence of the Chilean judicial system to proceed in the matter as it sees fit.</P>

      <P>In response to a request from Ireland, the EU Presidency has made inquiries in the United Arab Emirates about reports that an Indonesian citizen has been condemned to death by stoning. The inquiries have established that this sentence &ndash; which has not been carried out &ndash; is subject to appeal before the Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi or, after the legal process has been exhausted, to an appeal for clemency to the Emir. It is also understood that a high level approach will be made by the Indonesian authorities. The European Union will continue to follow this case attentively.</P>
      <P>The Government has made clear its total opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has a specific budget allocation as part of its overseas development assistance which enables a speedy and effective response to humanitarian emergencies. The allocation for 2000 is £7 million. Ireland works closely with other like-minded countries and humanitarian organisations to develop and implement good practice in this area. Humanitarian interventions must, in so far as is possible, be in line with the highest humanitarian principles, be co-ordinated, based on a proper assessment of needs and monitored to ensure that relief reaches those most in need.</P>
      <P>The key to an effective and timely response by the international community to emergency situations is a co-ordinated and collective approach to the provision of assistance. A number of international humanitarian agencies exist which individually, and working together, facilitate a speedy response to disasters. These include UN agencies such as the UN High Commission for Refugees, the world food programme and UNICEF, the Red Cross family and non-governmental organisations. These agencies have rapid response mechanisms in place.</P>
      <P>As part of the reform programme of the UN, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) was established in 1998. OCHA was mandated by the member states to mobilise and co-ordinate the collective efforts of the international community, in particular those of the UN system, to meet the needs of those suffering the effects of humanitarian emergencies. OCHA, with the strong support of donor countries, including Ireland, co-ordinates the overall response, identifies gaps, avoids duplication and unnecessary competition among aid agencies which, unfortunately, still occurs all too frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OCHA has a number of mechanisms through which countries respond collectively to sudden onset emergencies. These include a resource base for UN disaster assessment and co-ordination (UNDAC) teams consisting of 140 skilled emergency managers from 32 countries and international organisations. UNDAC teams <Col N="1182" /> have trained together and are fully self-sufficient ready to be sent immediately to disaster situations.</P>
    <P>The OCHA also has a military and civil defence unit to ensure the most efficient use of military and civil defence assets in support of humanitarian emergencies. Military and civil defence assets can only be employed at the request, or with the consent of the receiving state.</P>
    <P>The issue of a UN-sponsored international logistical force, capable of responding immediately to crisis situations, raises complex questions of sovereignty and of resources including, for example, the status of such a force and whether it would be under the control of the Secretary General or of national governments.</P>
    <P>There is also considerable focus at the UN on the need for clarification of the principles and the establishment of agreed criteria for intervention by other member states. The requirements of humanitarian intervention must be reconciled with other principles such as national sovereignty or non-intervention as established by the UN charter. These are sensitive issues which need careful consideration by the international community.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the ability of the international community to respond speedily, efficiently and effectively to emergencies has improved qualitatively in recent years. However, it is equally recognised that continued efforts are needed to build and consolidate the achievements to date and to learn lessons from each humanitarian intervention. The focus must always remain on saving and protecting the lives of those most affected.</P>
    <P>The Government's main aim in emergency situations is to get the right sort of assistance to the victims as speedily and as effectively as possible. This is the main determinant in choosing the channel of assistance. Ireland responds through non-governmental organisations which are established in the affected country or region and therefore have the local knowledge, expertise and capacity to re-act speedily and effectively to emergencies; through multilateral organisations, such as the UN agencies and the Red Cross family which have a presence in most countries and are most often in a position to move immediately to help local efforts and through the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) which was specifically set up to allow a unified EU response to humanitarian emergencies. In 1999, ECHO's funding amounted to almost 810 million euro.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid has guidelines and procedures in place for the disbursement of emergency funding. These have been developed in line with international norms and in consultation with non-governmental organisations. In the case of rapid-onset emergencies, there is an urgency procedure in place which enables the Minister to approve funding to facilitate a quick, efficient and effective response to humanitarian emergencies through the organisations most qualified to re-act <Col N="1183" /> in the particular circumstances. This response is co-ordinated with other donors through the EU and through UNOCHA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last twelve months have seen an intensification of the relations between Ireland and Mexico against the background of a number of bilateral visits and contacts, as well as new developments in our formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Bilateral contacts saw the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Rosario Green, visit Ireland in March 1999. This was followed in April by President McAleese's highly successful state visit to Mexico.</P>
      <P>On 1 April 1999 the Government announced its decision to establish an embassy in Mexico City and this was opened in October 1999. In September 1999, the then Minister, Deputy Andrews, maintained the momentum of Ireland's new relationship with Mexico when he met the Foreign Minister, Mrs. Green, in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. One of his final engagements as Minister for Foreign Affairs was a meeting with the Minister, Mrs. Green, when, in his capacity as chairman of the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, he welcomed Mexico's new status as an observer to that body in January last.  Last month, <i>en marge </i>of the meeting of European Union and Latin American Foreign Ministers in Vilamoura, Portugal, I briefly met the Foreign Minister, Mrs. Green, and we took the opportunity to review developments in our bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Mexico in recent years has become an increasingly important economic and political force in Latin America. The importance of the role Mexico plays in that rapidly changing region has been reflected in its active leadership as President of the Rio Group of Latin American countries and in its very effective co-chairmanship of the summit between the EU and the Latin American and Caribbean countries in Rio de Janeiro in June 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission has recently completed a series of negotiations on trade and economic relations with Mexico. These negotiations were undertaken on foot of the interim agreement on trade and trade related matters, which had been signed on 8 December 1997. The interim agreement is one of community competence and is separate from the global agreement on economic partnership, political co-ordination and co-operation, which is of mixed competence as between the community itself and its member states, and which was signed on the same date. The global agreement was approved by Dáil Éireann on 23 June 1999. The global agreement has consequently been ratified by <Col N="1184" /> Ireland. The agreement contains a human rights clause.</P>
    <P>The results of the trade negotiations conducted by the commission with Mexico are comprehensive in scope and cover the broad range of economic and trade relations between the EU and Mexico, including market access, services, capital movements, public procurement, dispute settlement procedures, rules of origin, anti-dumping safeguards, agriculture, fisheries and customs co-operation. These should produce increased trade and investment flows between the EU and Mexico.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the negotiations was discussed at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 14 February 2000 and is expected to be adopted by a decision of the EU &ndash; Mexico Joint Council, which will be held in Lisbon today, <i>en marge</i> of the Special European Summit on Employment, in the presence of President Zedillo of Mexico.</P>
    <P>Mexico is Ireland's most important trading partner in Latin America, accounting for more than 30% of our trade in the Latin American and Caribbean region, and a growing volume of Irish investment. Ireland has been able to accept the results of the negotiations without any difficulty and fully endorses the global agreement and the interim agreement with Mexico, which are expected to benefit both Mexico and the EU and the member states. The agreements should also assist Ireland to develop its bilateral political and trade relations with Mexico. Already a delegation from the Irish-Mexican Business Association has visited Mexico this month to prepare for a full-scale visit later this year.</P>
    <P>Mexico's influence is also felt outside its own region, not least at the United Nations where it is one of Ireland's partners in the New Agenda initiative on nuclear disarmament. In the course of the preparatory work on the convention to ban landmines, Ireland and Mexico worked closely together as members of the central core group which led the negotiations.</P>
    <P>During President McAleese's state visit to Mexico, two memoranda of understanding on cultural and educational exchanges were signed. My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has followed this up with a visit to Mexico in September 1999 which has stimulated further cultural contacts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent intensification of relations between Ireland and Mexico and see these as a foundation for the forging of closer ties between the two countries, both bilaterally and in an EU context, and as co-operating partners on matters of international concern in multilateral fora. The planned visit of the Taoiseach to Mexico in September of this year will provide a timely opportunity to review the development of these relations, and to set them on the right path for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 70 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>The security situation in Kosovo is a cause for serious concern. There have been a number of incidents resulting in injuries to international, mainly French and Russian, KFOR troops. Nevertheless in the rest of Kosovo, apart from Mitrovica and one or two other areas, the number of ethnic clashes has decreased. This is due in part to the fact that ethnic Serbs and other minorities have either left Kosovo altogether or gathered themselves into well protected ethnic strongholds, and in part due to firm action by KFOR and the UN international police. There is still concern, however, at attacks taking place between ethnic Albanians, as extremists attack supporters of more moderate political leaders. There is also concern about the involvement of former Kosovo Liberation Army fighters in organised crime, including drug smuggling and trafficking in women.</P>
      <P>Although still tense, the situation in Mitrovica is under control and some KFOR reinforcements drafted into the city in the wake of recent disturbances have now left. The presence of the international police has been augmented. The town is still divided along ethnic lines, ethnic Serbs in the area north of the River Sitnica and ethnic Albanians to the south. Negotiations are under way with community leaders of both sides with the aim of allowing freedom of movement for ethnic Albanians, addressing the security concerns of the ethnic Serbs, and allowing orderly returns of members of both ethnic communities to their homes. The ultimate aim of the United Nations administration in Kosovo is to create a visibly different administration for Mitrovica, involving a joint municipal government which can serve as an example elsewhere in Kosovo. This success of this political process will depend not only on the international police and KFOR to provide a secure environment, but also on progress in expanding public services and encouraging economic revival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another major focus of concern is the Presevo valley area of south western Serbia, which lies on <Col N="1186" /> the border with Kosovo and is inhabited by many ethnic Albanians. As a direct result of attacks by an ethnic Albanian paramilitary group, the Presevo Liberation Army (PLA), on Serbian police units in the region and the resulting security operation by the Serbian authorities, some 7,000 refugees have crossed over into Kosovo. The aim of the PLA would seem to be to provoke a conflict in the Presevo area in the hope of encouraging an intervention by KFOR troops. The international community is determined to avoid this and KFOR has reinforced controls on the border to prevent the passage of paramilitaries and arms from Kosovo. Albanian political leaders have been encouraged to distance themselves from PLA activities and objectives.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this difficult security situation, real progress has been made in Kosovo. A joint interim administrative structure and an interim administrative council have been set up, allowing local people some say in their own government. The ethnic Serb community still refuses to participate in these structures, because of concerns about their security. It is suspected that the Milosevic regime in Belgrade is influencing the Serb community in Kosovo; however, negotiations are continuing and it is hoped that Serb representatives will eventually agree to participate.</P>
    <P>Registration of voters is being carried out in preparation for elections which will take place in September or October. It is hoped that, following these elections, further progress can be made towards democratic self government for Kosovo, with the participation all the ethnic communities.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support international efforts in Kosovo, aimed at building a multi-ethnic democratic and pluralist society which will contribute to the stability of the entire western Balkans region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, by decision of 28 September 1999, approved the establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. It is the intention that the Ambassador to Mexico will shortly be formally accredited to Cuba, with the Cuban Ambassador to London being accredited to Dublin. The Cuban Foreign Minister, Felipe Perez Roque, visited Dublin on 27 October to mark the establishment of relations between our two countries, at which time he met with the then Minister Andrews and discussed a range of issues of mutual interest. The establishment of formal diplomatic ties will enable us to deepen the friendly relations which already exist between Ireland and Cuba. It will also provide a platform and a new impetus for the further development of economic, <Col N="1187" /> social and cultural links between our two countries.</P>
      <P>With our partners, we subscribe to the EU Common Position on Cuba, which was originally adopted under the Irish Presidency of the EU in December 1996. The aim of the Common Position is to foster a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict in Cuba or mass emigration from there. In the spirit of the Common Position, Ireland and our EU partners oppose the US embargo against Cuba and we have consistently conveyed this view to the US authorities, as well as regularly voting against the embargo at the UN general assembly, together with all our EU partners. However, the Common Position also makes clear that full co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent and enduring absence of fundamental human and political rights in that country.</P>
      <P>After the Pope's visit to Cuba in January 1998 there had been a certain easing of repressive measures against political dissidents and a reduction in the number of political prisoners. Subsequently the situation deteriorated again, with an increase in the number of political detentions. In January 1999 the criminal law was amended to introduce new and even harsher legislation aimed at curbing dissidence. In March 1999, four members of the internal dissidence group were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In a statement issued on 17 March, the EU expressed its deep regret at the sentences passed. It pointed out that the people convicted had exercised a freedom of expression which is recognised universally as a human right and that the EU could not accept that citizens exercising such a right should be criminalised by State authorities. The EU also rejected judicial proceedings of a political nature and expressed deep concern about the amendments to the criminal law further curtailing the exercise of the rights of citizens. In February 2000, there was however another discouraging development when three political dissidents were tried and sentenced to prison terms of one to three years.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the EU reiterated its continuing objective of encouraging a peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the Common Position.</P>
      <P>Ireland has supported a number of resolutions on human rights in Cuba at the UN Commission on Human Rights, including at the last session in early 1999. With all of our EU partners, we once again called on Cuba to co-operate with all human rights mechanisms of the UN.</P>
      <P>It is our intention to continue a dialogue with Cuba on these and other issues, in a spirit of friendship and goodwill. At the same time, and building on our newly established diplomatic links, we will work to develop and strengthen the overall political, economic and cultural relations between our two countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The decision by Turkey's Appeals Court on 25 November 1999 to uphold the death sentence against Abdullah Öcalan led to widespread international appeals, including by the European Union, to spare Mr. Öcalan's life. The Turkish Government decided on 12 January to postpone the transmission of Mr. Öcalan's case to the Turkish Parliament until the European Court of Human Rights had completed its consideration of the case. It is understood that this process may take up to 18 months.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly supports the appeals to Turkey not to execute Mr. Öcalan, and our view has been put to the Turkish authorities on numerous occasions, both bilaterally and on the occasion of EU-Turkey contacts. In this regard, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, communicated our views directly to the then speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly during his visit to Dublin last March. He responded to our concerns positively. I am following proceedings in the Öcalan case with the closest attention, and will avail of an early opportunity to reiterate Ireland's opposition to the use of the death penalty in this and in all other cases, directly to the Turkish authorities.</P>
      <P>The Government also continues to follow closely the general situation of human rights in Turkey. Although I have not yet had an opportunity to meet my Turkish opposite number, I am looking forward to an early meeting and in the meantime I have instructed the Irish Ambassador in Ankara to ensure that I am kept fully up to date with recent developments. In this regard Ireland, together with EU partners, was seriously concerned at the recent arrest and imprisonment of three mayors from the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party (HADEP). The Government welcomes their release from prison and reinstatement to office and will continue to monitor developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 June 1999 Prime Minister Ecevit promised that Turkey would undertake legal reform to improve its human rights record and that as a priority it would develop democracy, expand freedom of thought and ensure an effective judicial system. Within the past year there have <Col N="1189" /> been some improvements reflecting the intention of the Turkish authorities to counter human rights abuses by public officers. In this respect several legislative and administrative measures have been adopted. A reform programme has been promised by May 2000. A commission of Turkish legal experts is being established to examine abolition of the death penalty. However a number of issues remain of serious concern, including in relation to the rights of minorities.</P>
    <P>At the Helsinki European Council last December, Turkey was accorded candidate status in relation to EU accession. However, the strengthening of Turkey's links with the European Union and its eventual accession depend on Turkey's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU and respect for and protection of minorities. The Government will continue to work actively to encourage Turkey on the path of reform and is ready to provide it with every support and practical assistance towards this end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made clear our total opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases. Its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>Sharia, the law of the land in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, permits corporal and capital punishment. The Saudi Arabian authorities interpret the universal concept of human rights through the principles of Islam. Public criticism of Islam, including the Sharia law, is strictly prohibited.</P>
      <P>In our ongoing contacts with the authorities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Ireland and our EU partners have conveyed our views on this matter, and impressed upon them the negative impact which such practices have on public perceptions.</P>
      <P>This is judged to be the approach most likely to be accorded serious consideration.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the situation in Columbia, particularly outlining the steps being taken by the international community to assist with bringing paramilitary and related murder to an end.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last October, the President of Colombia, Mr. Andrés Pastrana, travelled to Europe to explain his country's peace process and to outline his intentions for the &ldquo;Plan Colombia&rdquo;, which will be designed to provide the economic and social underpinning <Col N="1190" /> for the peace process. When he addressed the European Parliament, and again when he met with Commissioner Chris Patten, President Pastrana indicated that once the peace process had got successfully under way, he would spell out the details of the kind of support Colombia would wish the European Union to provide.</P>
      <P>Since President Pastrana's European visit, the peace process has suffered some setbacks but there have been hopeful signs also. These have included a temporary ceasefire in December by the main guerilla group, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), continued contacts since between the two sides, and the dispatch to Europe last month by the Colombian Government of a delegation which included both Government and FARC representatives. This delegation held discussions with a number of European governments, as well as other economic and social interlocutors in order to explore the ways in which the experience of other countries might offer suggestions as to how Colombia could shape a socio-economic model to marry economic growth with social justice. Recent media reports indicate moves towards involving right-wing paramilitary groups in the peace efforts, with proposals from the paramilitary United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC) to scale back their attacks on rebel groups in return for a place at the talks table.</P>
      <P>It is to be hoped that these contacts will shortly bear fruit and bring to an end the plight of the people of Colombia who have been the long-suffering victims of violence inflicted by all sides. The violence of the left-wing insurgent groups in Colombia, including the FARC and the National Liberation Army (ELN) is matched by that of the right-wing paramilitaries (often associated with the official security forces). These protagonists have shown equal indifference to the plight of the civilian population, to whom no immunity is extended.</P>
      <P>As President Pastrana himself acknowledged in his speech to the European Parliament, breaches of human rights by agents of the state are especially abhorrent. The Colombian government is aware of the particular concern expressed by the Irish Government and its EU partners on that score. President Pastrana has established a special committee to expedite investigations into human rights violations as part of a new, integrated human rights strategy. He has also accepted the help of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, in establishing a national plan for human rights. In addition to the presence in Bogota of an office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Secretary-General has appointed Mr. Jan Egelund as a special representative dealing with the peace process in Colombia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, together with our European partners, is fully engaged with the situation in Colombia. The embassies of the EU member states in Bogota are in close and constant contact with the Colombian authorities, and report regularly on the <Col N="1191" /> developing peace process. The EU and its member states are already Colombia's largest single aid donor. When the terms of the new Plan Colombia are announced, I am sure that the EU will be responsive. Ireland and her European partners will play a full part in providing appropriate support for the peace process which is designed to build a better future for the long suffering people of Colombia, based on human rights, democracy and equitable social and economic development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 150 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomed the announcement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on 29 January 1998 of the establishment of a new, independent, judicial tribunal of inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday. The tribunal is beginning its public oral hearings in the Guildhall in Derry on 27 March next. This will be an important step forward in the task of fully and finally establishing the truth about that tragic day.</P>
      <P>The Government understands that, of the 29 rifles fired by troops on Bloody Sunday, 16 have been destroyed in total and 10 have been sold through private companies. A police investigation has begun into the destruction of the weapons.</P>
      <P>The Government has conveyed to the British authorities its deep concern about these developments. It has been informed that efforts are being made to locate the ten rifles that were sold off. It has also sought an assurance that the remaining three rifles in the possession of the British Ministry of Defence have been secured. The Government will continue to monitor developments closely in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has maintained close and regular contact with the Bloody Sunday relatives and injured, their legal representatives and members <Col N="1192" /> of the Bloody Sunday Trust. We will continue to do so during the substantive phase of the inquiry's work. An officer of the Department will monitor developments at these hearings.</P>

      <P>With regard to the possible imposition of sanctions against Russia, this question would have to be carefully considered. We would need to weigh carefully the implications for the reform process in Russia and the impact on the vulnerable civilian population, if the international community were to take steps which would begin to isolate Russia. Ultimately it may be better to keep Russia engaged in the relevant international organisations and with the international community, whilst continuing to press for urgent change.</P>

      <P>The Irish citizen referred to in the Deputy's question, who, incidentally was born in Britain and is therefore also a British national, has been in custody in Chonburi prison in Thailand since July 1997 when he was charged with murder. In the absence of any Irish mission in that country our embassy in Kuala Lumpur, with the assistance of the British Embassy in Bangkok, is looking after his consular protection.</P>
      <P>The two embassies put him in contact with a Thai lawyer soon after his arrest but he subsequently accepted the services of lawyers appointed by the court. Officers of the Irish Embassy visited him in October 1997 and in February 1999; he is visited frequently by a representative of the British Embassy &ndash; the next visit is scheduled for 27 March &ndash; and receives money for expenses from a relative in Ireland through that embassy's good offices. The embassies have also been assisting him to get medical and dental treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1998 the Irish Embassy formally asked the Thai Department of Corrections to remove leg irons which the prisoner was being <Col N="1193" /> obliged to wear but it was not until April 1999 that the embassy learned that they had been removed by order of the court.</P>
    <P>The overcrowded and harsh conditions in which he still has to live are very difficult but the embassies have done and will continue to do all they can to make them tolerable.</P>
    <P>Court hearings take place about once a month and the next is set for 10 April 2000.</P>
    <P>There are indications that there may be a decision in the case shortly but this remains to be confirmed.</P>

      <P>The question of accession by the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) has arisen in the context of discussions in the body, known as the &ldquo;Convention&rdquo;, which has been established to elaborate a draft charter of fundamental rights.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe, which is an observer at the convention, is concerned at the potential implications of the EU Charter for the human rights standards set by the Council of Europe, with particular regard to the ECHR. The Council of Europe believes that the most effective way of clarifying the relationship between the charter and the ECHR would be for the EU to accede to the ECHR. A number of members of the Convention have also advocated Union accession to the ECHR as at least a partial solution to the problem of potential conflicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Community law now stands, the EU has no competence to accede to the ECHR, and accession would, therefore, require treaty amend<Col N="1194" /> ments.  This would, of course, necessitate the holding of a referendum in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Convention has been tasked to present a draft charter in advance of the December 2000 European Council. The Government will continue to follow closely the discussions in the Convention, including discussion in relation to the question of accession by the EU to the ECHR, through the Taoiseach's representative, Deputy O'Kennedy. The Government is concerned that, whatever the outcome of the process, it cannot be achieved at the cost of creating a two-tiered jurisdiction in human rights to the detriment of overall human rights protection.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 29 March 1999 to implement new operational arrangements for the management, development and delivery of the national employment service function. These included: the assimilation of the local employment service under FÁS, as a discrete component of a more integrated, dual-stranded national employment service, the other component being the existing FÁS employment service; the establishment of an employment service advisory committee within FÁS which will have responsibility for advising the FÁS executive on the operation and development of all components of the national employment service function, including the LES, and membership of the advisory committee to comprise the following representatives drawn from the main FÁS board: one Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, one Department of Finance, one Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, one Department of Education and Science, one IBEC, one ICTU, and one worker director; together with a representative each from INOU, PLANET, the representative body of the partnerships, ADM and the LES co-ordinators.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed that the advisory committee will include a representative from the FÁS executive, most likely from the employment services side.</P>
      <P>This integration between the FÁS employment service and the LES, apart from having been advocated in various evaluation reports in recent years, has been endorsed in the current new social partnership agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the benefits of assimilation are to be fully secured there must be clear lines of responsibility and authority. With this in mind, I instructed FÁS to consult each partnership with a view to putting in place the administrative structures which will achieve co-ordinated transparent and accountable management of the service so that the LES <Col N="1197" /> can deliver an effective and efficient service to its clients. My Department has now clarified a number of outstanding issues with FÁS and has asked it, while having due regard to the distinctive local characteristics, to expedite its consultations with the partnerships. I look forward to early progress in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 106 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The £560 million Technology Foresight Fund was recently established in response to the increasingly important link between technological development and the future competitiveness of Irish based industry. It marks a new departure for public sector investment in modern sectors of technology, identified by the highly consultative technology foresight study, as being key drivers in future competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The new fund will be used to establish Ireland as a location for world class excellence in niche areas within information and communications technologies and biotechnology. A dedicated foundation, operating under the aegis of Forfás, is being established to manage, allocate, disburse and evaluate expenditure from the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In achieving its objective, the foundation will consult widely with national and international experts, in selecting the niche areas, fund world class research in the selected niches, on the basis of a competitive international peer review process and ensure that continuation of support for any project, funded by the new foundation will be dependant on a continuing research output, at a <Col N="1198" /> world class level. It is envisaged that the new foundation will have a two pronged approach to funding. First, researchers in third level colleges and research institutions will be offered the opportunity to compete for funds through the international peer review process. Second, the foundation will have the option to establish its own laboratories if necessary to secure world class performance.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from this fears expressed in the past by some third level researchers that this foundation will be a stand-alone institution are unfounded. The ultimate success of this investment will be a strong partnership with the other players &ndash; industry, third level colleges, research institutes and research funding bodies.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Shatter's query about the level of funds to be awarded to particular types of research, decisions on this matter will be a function of the management of the new foundation and will emerge from the consultation and competitive process which I have already outlined. However, I stress that the Technology Foresight funding is additional and complementary to existing spends by Departments and agencies. It may supplement existing research activities to enable them to achieve the required standard and scale.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, paragraph 4.2(4), provides for the establishment in early 2000 of a special working group comprising the social partners and representatives of Departments. The work of this group will include: identifying the key essential services currently being provided through CE and accessing the <Col N="1199" /> implications of those services for CE in terms of budget, number of places, having regard to the planned reduction of 4,500 places, as per the Government decision in July 1999 to restructure CE, and the objectives of CE, including the provision of community services. The findings of the working group will then be considered by Government.</P>
    <P>This special working group will be established as soon as the PPF has been ratified by all parties and has taken effect. An audit has been undertaken by FÁS into certain key essential services provided under CE. A copy of the results of this audit has already been provided to the social partners with a view to progressing the work of this group. My Department has already had preliminary discussions with the Department of Education and Science regarding the possible mainstreaming of certain services in the education sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> The city and county enterprise boards have supported micro-enterprises, ten employees or less, which have created 20,045 jobs during the six years 1994-9. This compares with an original target of 8,000 jobs in the EU funded Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-9.</P>
    <P>Because many of these jobs are in locally provided services, and thereby vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, the external evaluator to the operational programme has been commissioned to establish the long-term sustainability of the jobs and businesses supported by the boards. The findings of the evaluator will be available later this year.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006, published in November 1999, indicated that there will be a progressive shift by the boards from the provision of direct financial assistance to softer forms of support such as advice, mentoring and management development and increasing recourse to refundable aid. This change in direction is designed to enable the boards to respond in a more effective and targeted manner to the circumstances and needs of micro-enterprises in the increasingly competitive business environment.</P>

      <P>The Government subsequently decided, in December 1999, that employers would no longer require work permits to take on these individuals and that the people concerned would instead be issued with identification or verification letters by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which they can present to potential employers when seeking employment.</P>
      <P>At the point where the second Government decision was made, December 1999, a total of 99 applications for work permits in respect of eligible asylum seekers had been received by my Department. Of these a total of 56 had been issued at that point and a further 11 approved, which were subsequently issued.</P>

      <P>The emergence of global value chains &ndash; whereby companies locate each component in the most efficient location &ndash; is increasing the pressure on low value added, low skill jobs. In response to this pressure, there are sectors of industry which will have to relocate from Ireland if they are to survive and this is an inevitable consequence of the economic improvements of recent years. The jobs that will replace those lost to low wage economies will be increasingly knowledge based.</P>
      <P>The Government is pursuing the transition to a knowledge economy by continuing its strong focus on education and training as the key to the economy of the future. This is being supported by initiatives such as Technology Foresight, under which £560 million is being committed to establish Ireland as a world class centre for research in biotechnology, and in information and communications technologies.</P>
      <P>At individual company level, companies are being encouraged by the development agencies to migrate their activities further up the value chain of their particular businesses in order to better exploit the advantages of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that this type of industrial restructuring is now a permanent factor of all modern, dynamic economies and to ensure that the policies and programmes are in place to deal with it. To effect this change, Enterprise Ireland is focusing on developing the capability of indigenous industry so that it can sustain and grow its competitiveness &ndash; specifically supporting companies' investment in research and development, marketing operations and human resource development areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>The Construction Safety Partnership Plan was launched on 28 February 2000. The plan sets out the conclusions and the recommendations of the Construction Safety Partnership which I set up in October 1999. The conclusions focus on improved worker safety representation on site, safety training for all in the industry, structured skills training and other measures. These measures will be strongly supported and implemented under the guidance of the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, FÁS, the Health and Safety Authority and the other participants in the Construction Safety Partnership. It is recommended that these measures become mandatory in the future. It is intended that all workers in the construction sector will be covered by the plan. I have arranged for a copy of the plan to be made available separately to the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continued enforcement and guidance is important and the Health and Safety Authority plans to be able to double the rate of construction industry site inspections by the end of this year with the additional resources sanctioned by the Government coming on-stream. Of 20 new <Col N="1203" /> inspector posts recently advertised by the authority, nine are intended for assignment to the construction sector. I also secured additional funding for the authority for this year to enable it to undertake awareness raising activities with regard to workplace health and safety and some of this campaign will be specifically targeted at the construction sector. The board of FÁS is also committed to making available the necessary human and financial resources to enable the aspects of the plan relevant to its area of activity to be implemented. Given that the plan is based on a partnership approach, all the parties to the plan will be contributing as appropriate to its implementation.</P>
    <P>The CSP will initially meet quarterly over the next year to oversee the implementation of the recommendations as well as provide a policy focus for other related consultative structures in the industry.</P>
    <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities, injuries and inspections in any work sector is collected by the Health and Safety Authority and is, therefore, obtainable directly from the authority at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2. I have been informed by the authority that 18 fatal accidents occurred in the construction industry in 1999 and four fatalities occurred in the sector in January and February 2000. The provisional number of accidents in the construction sector notified to the authority for 1999 is 1,069. A further 73 dangerous occurrences which did not involve actual injury were also notified to the authority for 1999.</P>
    <P>Non-fatal accident data for January and February 2000 has not yet been analysed.</P>

It shows 39 directives for implementation, 15 by the end of 1999, of which four are the subject of primary legislation currently before the Houses, nine are with the parliamentary draftsman and two are with me for signature of regulations, 14 during this year, of which drafting has already started for ten, and ten between next year and the beginning of 2005.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a restructuring of community employment during 1999, the following eligibility criteria apply to persons who wish to participate in the options available under the programme. The part-time integration option is aimed at persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows/widowers pension for a minimum period of 12 months. The eligibility age for participation in CE was raised from 21 years to 25 years on 1 January 2000 with the following exceptions: travellers, ex-offenders, refugees, people with disabilities, people referred under <Col N="1216" /> drugs task force, offshore island inhabitants, and 18 to 24 year olds, referred through EAP, who are 18 months or more unemployed. Persons with disabilities registered with and referred by the NRB are eligible and travellers of any age and in receipt of UA or UB for any period or lone parents allowance for one year or longer qualify. Participants remain on this programme for a period of one year. A limited number of people can remain for a second year in circumstances where it will facilitate their progression to employment.</P>
      <P>The part-time job option/rate for the job is targeted at persons who need a longer programme in order to become job ready. Participants must be 35 or over and three years unemployed and in receipt of the payments stated previously. The participant can remain on this option for a period up to three years. There is no age requirement for travellers. They must be in receipt of an unemployment payment for one year or longer to participate in this option. Persons 35 or over with disabilities registered with and referred by the NRB are eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other changes to the programme which are part of the restructuring process and are currently <Col N="1217" /> being phased in include: duration of participant breaks between schemes will be increased from six to 12 months, and future participation in CE by an individual will be capped at three years. An individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account. These changes take effect from April 2000. Offshore island residents are exempt from these changes.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to implement the phased reduction in the participation levels on CE, which has a target participation rate of 28,000 by the end of 2003. There will be synchronisation to the greatest degree possible between the introduction of the new social economy programme and reductions of CE places.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness makes specific provision for the establishment of a special working group, comprising the social partners and representatives of Departments to: identify the key essential services currently being provided through CE and assess the implications of those services for CE in terms of budget, number of places, having regard to the planned reduction of 4,500 places, as per the Government decision, and the objectives of CE, including the provision of community services. The findings of the special working group will be considered by Government.</P>

      <P>The complaint from the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association, currently before the European Commission, concerning the taxation of credit unions was raised during the meeting. It was noted that any additional tax changes could aggravate the present position. The Taoiseach and I agreed to seek legal advice in relation to these matters, and I understand that the Department of Finance has now done so. We will consider that advice on receipt and have undertaken to consult with the league again in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that the recommendations of the working group on the taxation of the returns on credit union savings will be re-examined following whatever decision the EU Commission takes on the matter. The need to ensure the integrity of the tax system as well as general equity aspects were emphasised to the league during the meeting.</P>

    <P>The position in relation to refugees and asylum seekers is as follows. Non-nationals who are granted refugee status by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform do not require work permits to take up employment with an Irish employer.</P>
    <P>In so far as asylum seekers are concerned, the Government decided in July 1999 that those who had been in this country for more than 12 months and who were still awaiting a determination of their application for refugee status at that date, should be given the right to work, pending a <Col N="1220" /> decision on their case. Between that date and December 1999, when the Government considered the issue again, a total of 67 permits were either approved or issued by my Department in respect of eligible asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>In December 1999 the Government considered the issue again and decided that in order to assist such asylum seekers in finding employment, employers should no longer require a work permit in order to take on such individuals. Instead they are now issued with a letter of authorisation or verification which they can present to potential employers when seeking work.</P>
    <P>In so far as matching of skills is concerned I have arranged to have funds allocated to FÁS to set up a special unit to help eligible asylum seekers find employment in Ireland. There are approximately 2,500 asylum seekers currently eligible to work.</P>
    <P>FÁS is at present recruiting 20 staff for the special unit. It will be mainly based in Dublin where the majority of asylum seekers reside. The main task will be to assess the skills of the eligible asylum seekers and to match them to available jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, allocated responsibility for issuing licences to moneylenders to the Director of Consumer Affairs. Applicants for a moneylender's licence must go through a formal application process. The Director of Consumer Affairs may refuse an applicant a licence on a number of grounds, including if, in the director's opinion, the cost of credit, interest rate plus additional charges, including collection <Col N="1222" /> charges, to be charged by the applicant is excessive or if any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are unfair. In a number of instances, her office has advised applicants that they would not be granted licences unless they reduced their proposed cost of credit. On each occasion, the moneylenders concerned reduced their proposed charges.</P>
      <P>The cost of credit charged by licensed moneylenders varies. I understand from the Director of Consumer Affairs that the costs of providing a moneylending service are considerably higher than those involved in mainstream credit lending. The costs are incurred in servicing the loan rather than funding the loan. For example, a typical moneylending operation involves home collected credit unlike a typical loan from a mainstream credit provider.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Director of Consumer Affairs that the number of complaints in relation to licensed moneylenders has continued to fall since the introduction of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995. Most complaints relate to the collection practices of moneylenders or their agents. The director investigates all such complaints and she has assured me that she receives the full co-operation of the licensed moneylenders in any such investigations.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has advised me that in seeking to ensure that licensed moneylenders are not imposing excessive rates of charge, she is anxious to ensure that licensed moneylenders are not replaced by unlicensed moneylenders. The director has also advised me that her office will continue to keep the total cost of credit charged by moneylenders under review.</P>

      <P>On 29 December last, I announced the establishment of a review group on auditing with the following terms of reference: whether self-regulation in the auditing profession is working effectively and consistently; whether any new or revised structures and arrangements are necessary to improve public confidence, and if so, what form should they take; the role of the external auditor in providing other services to the same institution; the impact of other functions such as tax advice and consultancy on the external audit process; the determination of fees, bearing in mind shareholder interests; the relationships between an external <Col N="1223" /> auditor and the management that appoints and remunerates him; the statutory provisions on auditing in the Companies Acts and related codes; the role of the external auditor in ensuring compliance with statutory provisions; the possible role of the Central Bank in regard to management letters issued by external auditors to financial institutions; the possible strengthening of audit standards relating to financial institutions; the suitability of having joint auditors to financial institutions with one being appointed by the Central Bank; the possible introduction of a maximum term of five years for an auditor to a financial institution and any matters directly related to the foregoing.</P>
      <P>These terms of reference are broader than that recommended in the PAC's DIRT Inquiry report to the extent that the review group has also been asked to evaluate self-regulation in the auditing profession. I decided that this recurring theme in the profession over the past number of years was one which could usefully be addressed in the group's work.</P>
      <P>Following a public advertisement seeking submissions by 31 January last on these terms of reference, over 30 bodies and individuals have made submissions to the group. The group has held two meetings to date and is progressing with its work.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has asked that the review group report back to the Oireachtas within six months of the date of its report, by 15 June 2000. It is hoped that the review group will be able to meet this deadline. This will depend to some extent upon the progress of its work in the intervening period.</P>

      <P>The facilities for the on-the-job, work based phases of the standards based apprenticeship system are provided by the individual apprentice's employer and monitored by FÁS. FÁS also provides the initial phase of the off-the-job training for apprentices. Apprentices who fulfil the relevant work and training and educational requirements can complete their apprenticeship. Due to an unprecedented increase in the numbers of apprentices being registered, some bottlenecks have arisen in the provision of off-the-job training. This has resulted in some delays for apprentices in completing their training. Delays have also arisen where employers fail to release apprentices for off-the-job training when called by FÁS or where apprentices refuse to take up the offer of training at a location specified by FÁS.</P>
      <P>From 1997 to 1999 the number of registered apprentices has risen from 11,371 to 20,893. FÁS has been increasing the level of training provision in response to the increased numbers.</P>
      <P>The number of apprentices completing off-the-job training in FÁS centres increased from 3,348 in 1997 to 4,984 in 1999. To cater for this, FÁS current cost spending in relation to this phase of training increased by 31% in 1998 over the previous year; the corresponding increase in 1999 was 33% and expenditure will rise this year by a further 19%. FÁS has recruited 39 additional temporary instructors to give extra apprenticeship courses. This significant investment by FÁS in its budgetary and training provision is designed to substantially address the bottleneck being experienced with this off-the-job phase of apprenticeship training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, has put in train a major capital invest<Col N="1226" /> ment programme to provide extra capacity for the educational component of apprenticeship. It is intended that extra facilities will be provided in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford Institutes of Technology as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the institutes of technology have been provided with additional resources to enable them to expand existing programmes where possible. Extra staff have been sanctioned and additional funding is being provided to meet the cost of extra courses. In the two financial years 1998 and 1999, a total of £6 million of additional recurrent funding was provided to fund additional courses. A further £5 million extra is being provided this year. As a result of the measures taken to date the number of apprentices completing off-the-job training in the education sector has increased from 2,035 in 1997 to 5,270 in 1999.</P>
    <P>Most recently, the Department of Education and Science has put forward proposals for additional apprenticeship classes at the institutes of technology during the summer months and is liaising with the institutes with a view to putting in place the necessary arrangements for this.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with FÁS and the Department of Education and Science, is continuing to keep the situation under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that motor insurance is often available only at a high price to young people, especially young male drivers. However, this is directly related to the adverse claims experience of young, especially male, drivers as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte and Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers is twice that for the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group are responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>My re-establishment of the motor insurance advisory board was a major initiative aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The board, whose expanded membership includes a member representing young drivers' interests, has undertaken an ambitious programme of work and research, particularly in relation to the basis of charges to young drivers.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Therefore, the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness amongst all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the gardaí, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has been asked to look at a graduated licensing system for learner drivers, based on the Ontario model which could have a significant impact if introduced here in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The special working group on a personal injuries tribunal, chaired by Mr. Dan McAuley, published its first report in May 1997. In that report the group set out two alternative structures for a mediation board for occupational injury claims &ndash; the first to operate within the courts system and the second, an alternative mediation structure, to be established on a greenfield basis, outside the ambit of the courts system and operating initially on a two year pilot basis.</P>
      <P>A majority of the working group had reservations about the cost effectiveness of a greenfield mediation board. It recommended a mediation system to be established within the courts system, having regard to assurances given to it about the rapid pace and scale of the ongoing reform of court procedures and elimination of delays.</P>
      <P>The special working group recommenced its work in September 1998 investigating issues surrounding alternative or complementary systems for delivering personal injury compensation in Ireland. It has recently completed its research into personal injury compensation systems in operation in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand and the USA, in the areas of occupational injuries and motor accident injuries.</P>
      <P>The group's consideration of the results of this research and its relevance to the possible improvement of the systems for delivering personal injury compensation in Ireland will, of necessity, involve a reappraisal of the recommendations in its first report on the establishment of a claims mediation system. The report, which will be submitted by the group shortly, will contain recommendations for our further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never intended to make provision for an artists' resale right, or <i>droit de suite</i>, in the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, which is currently before this House in committee. As I have made clear in the course of the debate on the Bill, if agreement is reached on an EU directive on this matter, the enactment of an artists' resale right in the context of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999 would not be opportune, for two reasons. First, the legislative and administrative requirements for an artists' resale right in an Irish context have never been given detailed examination and consideration at official or government level. This would have to be done before the Government could agree to the inclusion of provision for such a measure in legislation. There is insufficient time to complete this process in the relatively short period within which the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, must be enacted in order to bring Irish copyright law into line with the requirements of EU and international copyright law.</P>
      <P>Second, a draft EU directive aimed at harmonising artists' resale right provisions in member states is now at a very advanced stage of negotiation. Ireland's current position is to support a compromise proposal recently devised which should allow all member states to adopt a common position on the proposed directive in the near future. The directive will then have a second reading before the European Parliament later this year. Since the directive in question, when adopted, will determine the form of artists' resale right to apply not only in Ireland, but throughout the EU, I believe that it would be imprudent to introduce legislation in this area at least until the final content of the directive becomes clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking careful note of the arguments made by Deputies on artists' resale right in the course of the Oireachtas debates on the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, and intend to consider the matter further in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera. For the reasons outlined, I am convinced that in the event of an EU <Col N="1231" /> directive being agreed, consequent legislation should be dealt with not in the present Bill, but in a separate legislative proposal at a more opportune date.</P>

      <P>In 1998, 11 multinational companies initially agreed to participate in an IDA pilot programme to encourage the employment of people with disabilities. One more company subsequently joined the programme, giving a total of 12 participating companies in all. The programme began in July 1998 and is now reaching a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The companies have been engaged in research, awareness, recruitment and selection programmes intended to promote access to employment for people with disabilities. The pilot programme focused primarily on graduates with disabilities. The programme was co-ordinated for IDA Ireland by the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability.</P>
      <P>The research undertaken in the programme will form the basis for the publication of transparent, effective and fair guidelines on recruitment and selection practices for people with disabilities. Awareness of disability issues in recruitment and selection has been further heightened through a series of seminars run under the programme for employers and career advisers.</P>
      <P>The pilot programme initiated and developed a scholarship programme for students with disabilities at third level, and some of the participating companies are offering scholarships this year. A number of the companies have also recruited people with disabilities through the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a wider process of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities, responsibility for the employment and vocational training of disabled people will transfer shortly from the Department of Health and Children to my Department. Many of the services currently administered by the National Rehabilitation Board will, under the new arrangements, be operated by FÁS. My Department has developed a series of strategies to encourage the employment of people with disabilities in the future and these are set out in Framework 3 of the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness. The main elements are: FÁS will review existing vocational training programmes for people with disabilities and will place an increased emphasis on progression to employment for people with disabilities; a new <Col N="1232" /> national supported employment programme, which was announced in Budget 2000, will be introduced this year and will be further developed over the coming years; the employment support scheme, which provides a wage subsidy to employers who recruit people with disabilities into open employment, will be vigorously promoted and funding for the scheme will be increased; funding for workplace adaptations to facilitate people with disabilities will be increased; to help the integration of people with disabilities into the workforce, FÁS, from this year, will make new grants available to companies for disability awareness training programmes for their staff; FÁS will also have a new grant available to employers to train or retrain employees who acquire a disability; my Department will examine existing disincentives to people with disabilities taking up employment and will seek to address those disincentives in consultation with other Departments, and my Department will also work with the social partners to stimulate awareness and to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector.</P>

      <P>The humanitarian situation in Mozambique is beginning to stabilise. Rescue operations are winding up and the emphasis is now on providing emergency relief to the displaced and affected population. Currently some 463,000 people, including the displaced and those who have been isolated, are receiving food aid. On 23 February the UN launched an initial appeal for US$13.5 million. By now over US$118 million has been received. The additional money will be used to fund a fresh appeal being put together by the UN which will target reconstruction work over the next six months.</P>
      <P>The Mozambican economy had been performing particularly well in recent years until the flooding disaster struck. This positive performance had been underpinned by a favourable policy environment and effective economic management, for which the government of Mozambique deserves full credit.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, there are grounds for optimism that the economy can return relatively quickly to a positive performance provided there is adequate support for both rehabilitation and long-term development. International meetings have been scheduled for the coming months to co-ordinate external assistance for rehabilitation and development. Ireland is ready to pledge significantly increased levels of support for both types of assistance as soon as needs have been determined and arrangements agreed for a division of effort among the donors.</P>
      <P>With respect to the distribution of bilateral assistance under the Ireland Aid programme, I can confirm that Mozambique will continue to be a priority country for this purpose; the other priority countries for bilateral assistance from Ireland are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided the context and the opportunity &ldquo;for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Agreement, an independent Commission on Policing was established, with Chris Patten as chairman. Its remit was to bring forward &ldquo;proposals for future policing <Col N="1237" /> structures and arrangements, including means of encouraging widespread community support for those arrangements&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Patten report, published in September 1999, comprehensively addressed the full range of important and sensitive issues related to policing. The Government, on publication of the report, said that the early and effective implementation of its recommendations would form an essential aspect of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole.</P>
    <P>The British Government's position on the implementation of the Patten report was set out on 19 January 2000, in a statement to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State. The Government welcomed the British Government's decision to accept the great majority of the proposals and looked forward to seeing &ldquo;a detailed implementation plan and the early publication of the necessary legislation following on from today's statement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The British Government is currently preparing a new Bill on policing in Northern Ireland, as well as preparing specific implementation plans. It is expected that both will be published shortly. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in his statement to the Commons on 19 January of this year, indicated that the new title of the service would come into force in the autumn of next year with the arrival of the first new recruits entering through the new independent recruitment mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Patten report considered that &ldquo;a mechanism is needed to oversee the changes required of all those involved in the development of the new policing arrangements, and to assure the community that all aspects of our report are being implemented and being seen to be implemented&rdquo;. It recommended that an oversight commissioner be appointed to fulfil this role. The Government considers that the speedy appointment of an oversight commissioner is key to the effective implementation of the report and has engaged in detailed discussions with the British authorities on the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is concerned at the deteriorating political and economic situation in Montenegro and the risk that this poses to regional stability. As a constituent member state of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Montenegro has suffered domination by its much larger partner, Serbia, and has been the victim of the policies of the <Col N="1238" /> Milosevic regime. The international community, which has been supportive of Montenegro in its resistance to Belgrade, is following the situation there closely. Both the OSCE and the European Community Monitoring Mission are represented in Montenegro and reports are received regularly enabling my Department to monitor events there. Montenegro is regularly discussed in the EU General Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>President Djukanovic won the presidential elections in February 1998 on a platform of political and economic reform. His opponent was the former president, and current FRY Prime Minister, Momir Bulatovic, who was supported by FRY President Milosevic. His victory was subsequently confirmed at parliamentary elections held in May 1998.</P>
      <P>An important element of President Djukanovic's policy is the renegotiation of the constitution of the FRY to give the constituent republics greater political freedom. Negotiations with Belgrade never seriously got off the ground. Since the election of the Djukanovic government Montenegro has been subject to a campaign of destabilisation inspired from Belgrade. While a serious crisis has so far been avoided the political and security situation in the country remains tense. Partly because of this, pro-independence sentiment in Montenegro has been steadily growing and there is pressure on the government to declare Montenegro an independent country, a move neither Djukanovic himself nor the international community want to see. The fear is that the significant Serbian community in Montenegro, supported by Milosevic, would be likely to resist by violent means a declaration of independence by Montenegro setting the scene for another Balkan civil war.</P>
      <P>The economy of Montenegro suffers from the political environment, although parts of the institutional and legal framework, within which economic activity takes place, have improved under Djukanovic, for example, legalisation of the deutschmark as a parallel currency with the debased FRY dinar and customs procedures at the boundary with Serbia. Serbia is the natural hinterland of a relatively small Montenegro and economic links with Serbia are so close that survival without them would be difficult. The links that the Djukanovic Government has tried to develop with Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot as yet supplant Serbia as the major market for the Montenegrin economy. Separation in the form of independence, from an economic point of view, would create a new weak, dependent, fragile and politically unstable area, which would not support the goal of stability either in Montenegro or in the region as a whole.</P>

    <P>It would seem that as long as Milosevic remains in power in Belgrade the destabilisation of Montenegro will continue. The EU through economic assistance for Montenegro and in the medium term assistance and economic integration in the wider region under the aegis of the Stability Pact for South East Europe can alleviate the worst <Col N="1239" /> economic effects of the political environment, and thus help the Djukanovic Government to remain on its reform course. This, along with a change of regime in Belgrade, offers the best hope for the future of the population of Montenegro.</P>

      <P>In May 1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo was inaugurated as the first democratically elected civilian President of Nigeria following 15 years of military rule. Since coming to power, the new president has taken a number of positive measures to promote respect for human rights, including commissioning a panel of eminent Nigerian citizens to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in the country from 1966 to 1999, and repealing repressive legislation.</P>
      <P>The newly elected president and his Government face a number of challenges in restoring the country to full democracy. Recently, the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in certain parts of northern Nigeria, and the efforts by some state authorities to extend it, have exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions there. Serious tensions also remain in the Niger Delta region.</P>
      <P>We welcome the initiatives taken by President Obasanjo to date, and with our EU partners and other members of the international community, will continue to work to promote political and economic reforms, and to co-operate with the elected authorities towards strengthening the rule of law, respect for human rights and good governance in the country.</P>

    <P>When joining Partnership for Peace on 1 December, 1999, Ireland set out in its presentation document the main areas of interest in it. <Col N="1240" /> Central to these is co-operation in the context of peacekeeping and peace support operations, and humanitarian tasks. Ireland is already participating actively in PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination arrangements have been set up under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding Irish participation in PfP and, in particular, the development of Ireland's individual partnership programme, reflecting the priority areas in the presentation document. Officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence have been selected for assignment to Ireland's PfP office in Brussels.</P>
    <P>As set out in the presentation document, the question of participation in PfP military training exercises is of interest to Ireland. Participation in such exercises is a matter for the Minister for Defence in the first instance.</P>

      <P>It is my policy that all transport operators, and in particular State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them.</P>
      <P>As already announced in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 all new and upgraded rail and bus stations financed under the plan will be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people, all light rail vehicles and suburban railcars financed under the plan will also be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people, and all buses purchased by CIE from 2000 for use on urban services will be low floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All DART carriages are already accessible, as are the diesel railcars used on the suburban services. Iarnród Éireann will take delivery of a further 26 DART carriages and 20 diesel railcars this year which will also be accessible. Wheelchair space is provided in the dining car areas of other passenger trains and, where advance notice of <Col N="1241" /> group travel is received, additional wheelchair space can be created.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath has approximately 30 low floor accessible buses currently in operation with a further 225 such buses on order for delivery this year.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann currently has 44 low floor accessible buses in operation and a further 66 such buses are on order for delivery later this year. The company is continuing to monitor developments in relation to coach design and manufacture which would improve Bus Éireann's capacity to meet the needs of people with mobility impairments.</P>
    <P>Among other things, the national development plan provides for the establishment of a public transport accessibility committee to advise me in relation to the accessibility of public transport for mobility impaired and disabled people. Included in the plan is a special provision of £10 million to part-finance accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities. The committee will advise me with regard to particular projects which could be funded from this allocation.</P>

      <P>Pursuant to the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1998, which came into effect on 1 October 1998, only one military branch, the head of which is the Chief of Staff, is located in my Department. Since 1998, the Chief of Staff has responsibility for the performance of the full range of the military business of the Department. He is the only military officer that reports directly to me on such business. This is a major change from the position prior to 1998 when there were three military branches in the Department and the head of each branch was directly responsible for and reported to me on the business of his branch. The Chief of Staff has, with my approval, delegated duties assigned to him by me to the deputy chiefs of staff and they in turn are responsible for and report to the chief of staff on such duties as are assigned to them.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances, bilateral meetings between myself, the chief of staff and other senior officers, both civilian and military, are a frequent and commonplace feature of the normal business of the Department of Defence. No particular formalities are associated with such meetings which take place as required on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 478 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, formerly section 5 of the Finance Act, 1996, introduced a tax relief in respect of the purchase and-or installation of house alarm systems for persons aged 65 years of age and over and living alone. The legislation provided specifically that the tax relief would only be available for the period 23 January 1996 to 5 April 1998.</P>
      <P>The tax relief was allowed to lapse in part because of the small numbers of claims being submitted and I have no plans to re-introduce the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the work done on specific performance indicators for each sector of the public service within his area of responsibility on the basis of which, under paragraph 1.4.16 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, certain pay increases over and above the norm might be paid; if these indicators will be published; if the indicators will be statistical and measurable in form; and the way in which the maintenance of progress will be monitored.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic pay terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; PPF &ndash; are the same in the public service and the private sector. Assuming the programme is ratified, the new pay agreement will commence in the public service on 1 October 2000 and will last for two years and nine months, expiring on 30 June 2003. It provides for the following increases in basic pay: 5.5% from 1 October 2000; plus a further 5.5% from 1 October 2001; plus a final increase of 4% from 1 October 2002.</P>
      <P>As indicated in paragraph 16 of section 1.4 of framework I and paragraph 4(c) of annex II, payment of the third phase increase of 4% will be dependant on specific performance indicators for each sector having being established by 1 April 2001 and these sectoral targets having been achieved by 1 April 2002, with progress in this regard having been assessed at organisational level by 1 October 2002.</P>
      <P>It is intended, once the programme has been ratified, that the performance indicators to be put in place for each sector will be developed and agreed through the partnership structures which were established under Partnership 2000. It would, therefore, be premature at this stage to say what form the indicators might take in the various sectors but it would be entirely appropriate for them to be published in due course. The assessment of verified progress in meeting these objectives will be a matter for the relevant secretary general, health board chief executive officer, county manager, etc. as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The programme also provides for the establishment of a quality assurance group in each sector. The agreed sectoral indicators will be supplied to the relevant group for confirmation that, in its view, the indicators meet the requirements outlined in the programme and the pay agreement, and are sufficiently challenging in that context. At a later stage, as each organisation confirms that its targets have been met, it will submit a report to the quality assurance group outlining the basis upon which the decision had been reached. It would be open to the group to examine the outcomes in the case of a number of selected organisations. If the group considers that the indicators or the subsequent progress reports are not satisfactory, they will be referred back to the partnership structures to be reviewed.</P>

      <P>As part of the provision of public access to Farmleigh, the Commissioners of Public Works sought, on 17 December 1999, temporary planning permission to hold, for a certain number of days each year, activities of an educational, musical or cultural nature within Farmleigh House and ancillary buildings. The December application also sought, in respect of Farmleigh Estate, temporary planning permission to hold for a certain number of days each year, events of a sporting, educational, musical or cultural nature and to provide for recreational activities during a certain period each year. The planning authority subsequently requested additional information in respect of the application and this is being prepared at present.</P>

      <P>The £1 million allocated to health boards for the benefit and support <Col N="1251" /> of carers was to be used in a flexible manner based on local needs. The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards have provided the following information requested by the Deputy:</P>
      <P>Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash;  £175,000 &ndash; Age Action and Care Alliance were provided with funding to set up carer support groups. The Carers Association was provided with funding to assist in the education and training of carers. Powerscourt parish was provided with funding for carer's transport. Crosscare provided respite care to carers. Age and Opportunity appointed a liaison officer to assist with the development and support of carers.  Skerries Day Care Centre was upgraded to assist in respite breaks for carers and Our Lady of Lourdes, Sheriff Street, received funding towards its day care centre.</P>
      <P>Midland Health Board &ndash; £100,000 &ndash; The allocation of funding was used for additional respite breaks during the summer months, to improve training for carers, to provide assistance to non statutory organisations, the funding of pilot projects and physio outreach activity.</P>
      <P>Mid-Western Health Board &ndash; £125,000 &ndash; The additional funding has provided respite breaks for carers and the establishment of carer support groups in care units for older people in the board's area. Carer support groups were established in collaboration with social services organisations and provide training and ongoing support to carers who are primarily caring in the home.</P>
      <P>North-Eastern Health Board &ndash; £100,000 &ndash; The allocation of funding was distributed to the three community care areas within the board's region. In the Meath community care area the allocation was used to grant aid voluntary organisations in the community. In the Louth community care area the allocation has been used to grant aid voluntary day care services, voluntary community services and to provide additional care supports to carers. In the Cavan-Monaghan area a project officer, grade IV, was appointed whose remit is to manage the links between the board's services and those of the voluntary sector. The project officer also provides support to existing voluntary activities-services and to the development of new initiatives which are aimed at improving the social well-being of the client group.</P>
      <P>North-Western Health Board &ndash; £100,000 &ndash; The board funded a caring for the carers survey &ndash; a survey of carers of older people and-or dependent people in Sligo-Leitrim-west Cavan. A home care support service was funded which provides respite breaks for full time carers. The allocation also provided additional home help hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Southern Health Board &ndash; £150,000 &ndash; The Carers Association received a grant to set up carers resource centres-carer outreach services, Cork and to support existing services. The <Col N="1252" /> Alzheimer Society of Ireland received a grant to support the association's carers support network and carer training programme. The board seconded a senior public health nurse to draw up a strategy for responding to carers needs. One of the recommendations of the strategy was the appointment of a development manager, carer support services. This appointment has been made and the strategy implementation process is now under way in consultation with Southern Health Board professionals and voluntary care groups.</P>
    <P>South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; £125,000 &ndash; The board conducted a research project to identify the information and health promotion needs of carers of older persons in consultation with the Waterford Institute of Technology and University of Ulster. The board provided funding for the development of additional services for carers including day care, respite care and home support services. Grants to many voluntary agencies caring for older people were increased, providing day care, meals on wheels and other support services. Co-ordinators of services for older people have been appointed in each community care area.</P>
    <P>Western Health Board &ndash; £125,000 &ndash; The board undertook a survey of carers and arising from the findings of this study, the board developed a policy to support carers in the Western Health Board area. This policy includes the appointment of three co-ordinators, one in each community care area, to develop carers support groups throughout the region in partnership with existing carer organisations, agencies working with people with disabilities and service providers e.g. community nursing units, district hospitals, geriatric hospitals and community services. The policy includes the development of local planning groups with representation from community services and carers themselves. The function of the local planning group is, in as far as it is possible, to identify and plan to meet the needs of carers in their local area which includes,<i> inter alia</i>, the development of planned respite and day care services. Additional initiatives undertaken in 1999 included grant aid to the Carers Association. The board also provided sponsorship for the National Carers Conference which took place in Ballina.</P>
    <P>I have allocated an additional sum of £1 million this year to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to further develop support services for carers in a flexible manner to meet their most urgent needs.</P>

      <P>The fluoridation of the public piped water supplies is an important programme for the protection of dental health and is subject to the provisions of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and various regulations made under the Act.</P>
      <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. All the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey of adult dental health carried out in 1991 found no significant difference in regard to general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. In October 1999, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a <Col N="1254" /> report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation.</P>
    <P>If an authoritative body in this country or internationally indicates that there is an issue of public health significance relating to the use of fluoride in water which should be investigated my Department would support this research in the usual manner.</P>
    <P>Health research in Ireland normally takes place under the auspices of the Health Research Board which identifies suitable projects based on priorities and peer evaluation.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for the licensing of medicinal products, including herbal medicinal products, in this country. In 1999, following an assessment of an application for a product authorisation, the IMB recommended to my Department that products containing St. John's Wort should be subject to prescription-only control in view of the public health concerns it had identified in connection with this herbal medicinal product. Since then, a number of other national regulatory authorities have also issued warnings in regard to these products, including the food and drugs administration in the United States, the European medicines evaluation agency of the European Union, and the medicines control agency in the United Kingdom, which recently published its concerns regarding the potential of St. John's Wort to interact with other commonly prescribed medicines. The Irish Medicines Board is the expert authority in this regard in this country and it has advised my Department that there are no grounds for altering its original recommendation to confine St. John's Wort to prescription-only control.</P>

I understand that the Southern Health Board has sought the input of Comhairle na nOspidéal with regard to the ENT service at Mallow General Hospital in the context of the development of this service. Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body responsible for regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staffs and such other officers or staffs as may be prescribed in hospitals engaged in the provision of services.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215, 216 and 223 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Part M of the building regulations places a duty on persons constructing or extending public buildings on or after 1 June 1992 to provide access for people with disabilities. Compliance with the regulations is primarily a matter for the designers, builders and owners of the buildings involved.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are responsible for enforcement of the regulations. It is, therefore, a matter for the authority to inspect public buildings to which the regulations apply. Under the regulations the authorities are empowered to inspect public buildings, issue enforcement notices for non-compliance with the regulations and initiate court proceedings. My Department does not have details of the enforcement notices served by the authorities. However, I have arranged for my Department to broaden the existing statistics compiled on building control to include such details from the current year onwards.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister in 1997 I have been urging local authorities to more actively enforce all parts of the building regulations, including part M. In particular, my Department's circular letter BC 7/99 on 17 June 1999 specifically called for stricter enforcement of part M. I understand that 35 out of 37 authorities have now appointed officers and the balance are in the process of making such appointments. I have also increased building control fees to provide local authorities with additional revenue to fund better enforcement. My Department will issue a further circular on the need for stricter enforcement of the building regulations generally, by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Government Departments and local authorities have been asked by my Department on a number of occasions over the years to ensure that appropriate provision is made for access facilities for disabled people to all buildings under their control, including public buildings constructed prior to the coming into operation of the building regulations on 1 June 1992. I have no proposals to apply part M of the building regulations retrospectively to pre-June 1992 public buildings.</P>
    <P>In July 1999 I issued a consultation document on my proposal to require all new dwellings commencing on or after 1 July 2000 to be accessible to disabled visitors. At the same time I indicated that the whole of part M was being thrown open for review and amendment in the current year. I intend to publish the revised part M within the next two months, following consideration of a wide range of comments received in consultation with the building regulations advisory body. When the definitive part M measures are published, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, in co-operation with my Department, will be holding a series of regional seminars throughout the country dealing with the revised technical guidance document M. The operative date for the revised part M is now likely to be 1 January 2001 so as not to disrupt the housing programme in the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> In my foreword to the consultation document on part M I summed up my own views on the enforcement of Part M as follows: &ldquo;I hope that part M, when amended and vigorously enforced, will deliver greatly improved accessibility to all our citizens including people with disabilities, in the new millennium &ndash; and not before its time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Less than 60% of the staff of my Department are Dublin based office staff. They are encouraged to cycle to work through the provision of a secure bicycle park and shower facilities. Almost 20% of my staff are field based staff who use cars as part of their official duties. The remaining 25% are located in decentralised offices in Ballina and Shannon where the use of bicycles, though desirable in some cases, would not be a practicable proposition for staff in most cases, given the distances between their homes and places of work.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent to eligible people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which rent supplement recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
      <P>An application for a rent supplement can be made by contacting the community welfare officer at a person's local health centre. Any person seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the health board that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources. In addition, the health board must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant and that the rent payable is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.</P>
      <P>Separated fathers are not precluded from obtaining rent supplement where they have custody or joint custody and they need to provide accommodation for their children. In a case where a separated couple have joint custody of a child, the requirements of both parents in respect of having adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is made. In these cases, documentation is required showing the joint custody arrangement before a decision could be made. Each case is individually assessed on its merits.</P>
      <P> There are no formal custody arrangements in place in the case that it is understood the Deputy has in mind. The children reside with the mother who is in receipt of rent supplement for the accommodation needs of herself and the two children. The father resides within 75 yards of the residence of the children and in the circumstances the health board refused to award a rent supplement for the father to accommodate the children. The health board appeals officer has upheld this decision. The person in question has recently appealed the decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the workforce.</P>
      <P>To qualify for participation an applicant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study except for recipients of disability allowance and blind person's pension where an age limit of 18 years applies. The age requirement has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1990. It was reduced to 21 years since then. Bearing in mind the nature of the scheme it would not be appropriate for it to be generally available at a lower age.</P>
      <P>Further improvements to the scheme are planned from September 2000. From that date the allowance will be available to recipients of invalidity pension, unemployability supplement and to persons previously in receipt of the carer's allowance.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is available towards the cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme only once-off costs associated with the purchase and/or installation of this type of equipment can be funded. <Col N="1267" /> There are no provisions to provide funding towards ongoing monitoring fees.</P>

      <Quest>if he will address the anomaly for means testing of REP scheme payments whereby those in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit and farm assist can disregard the first £2,000 REP scheme money while those on disability allowance are means tested; if those in receipt of disability allowance will be approved a back payment to the date when the disregard of the REP scheme money was first introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the disregard of income arising under the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; was originally introduced in 1996, it was confined to those social assistance schemes which were considered to be of most direct relevance to farmers, i.e. unemployment assistance &ndash; smallholders assistance &ndash;  pre-retirement allowance and old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>With the introduction last year of a specific farm-related income support payment scheme, i.e. the farm assist scheme, it was considered more appropriate to confine, as far as possible, all farm related exemptions and incentives to this scheme. The existing REPS disregard has, therefore, been applied to this new scheme.</P>
      <P>The REPS disregard is not relevant in the case of the unemployment benefit scheme, as this is a social insurance payment and is not, therefore, subject to a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the REPS disregard does not apply in the case of the other social assistance schemes, it should be noted that many of these schemes already have their own separate income dis<Col N="1268" /> regards which would apply to REPS payments. For instance, under the carer's allowance scheme there is a weekly income disregard of £75 for a single person and £150 in the case of a couple. The one-parent family payment provides that the first £115 of weekly income is disregarded. Both of these income disregards apply also to payments made under the REPS scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the disability allowance scheme, the first £50 of earnings from rehabilitative employment is currently disregarded for means test purposes. Last December's budget provides for a 50% increase in the level of this disregard, from £50 to £75 a week. In addition, I have made provision in the Social Welfare Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas, for an extension of this enhanced disregard to those in rehabilitative self-employment. It is estimated that some 1,300 self-employed recipients of disability allowance will benefit from this measure, which will come into operation in early April. This £75 earnings disregard will apply also to income from REPS payments.</P>

The scheme will be advertised shortly in the national newspapers.</P>
      <P>The scheme does not fall within the scope of the national minimum wage legislation and therefore the minimum wage will not apply.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to increase the rate of pay under the scheme this year.

      <P>While I appreciate that older people are reluctant to divulge personal information, in order to administer this and other grant schemes which are funded from public money, my Department must ensure that all criteria are adhered to. As it is a condition of the scheme that individuals must be aged 65 and over it is necessary to provide details of age and RSI number in order to verify that all proposed beneficiaries satisfy this eligibility criteria. I can assure the Deputy that applications and the information contained therein, for all grants schemes operated by my Department is regarded with the utmost confidentiality and is required for the above administrative purposes only.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that all vulnerable elderly people are made aware of the scheme and commend the energy and commitment of voluntary organisations who have worked tirelessly in their own communities to enhance the profile and to promote the benefits of the scheme. In November 1999, my Department also sought to heighten awareness of the scheme by circulating a newsletter to some 311,000 pensioners, outlining details of all relevant schemes including information on the scheme of community support for older people.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, after the establishment of the European Union, the European Commission has adopted a series of eight directives to date in relation to summer time arrangements in the European Union. The most significant development to come from these Directives has been the harmonisation of the date of change to summer time in member states.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the European Commission recently commissioned a comprehensive study on summer time. The study was aimed at identifying and evaluating the effects of summer time in all member states of the Union and, in particular, in the fields of energy consumption, public health, working conditions and lifestyles, agriculture, environmental protection, road safety and the tourism and leisure industries.</P>
      <P>The Commission's study will be considered in conjunction with proposals for summer time arrangements with the other member states of the European Union.</P>

      <P>Indictable crime statistics, including the detection rate, for each Garda division by crime categories and per 1,000 of the population can be found in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.

      <P>Four of the 23 schools which had originally not agreed to implement the escort scheme have now informed my Department of their agreement to proceed with the appointment of their escorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two further schools subsequently informed my Department that they would not implement the scheme, leaving 21 schools which have not yet agreed to participate in the scheme. Details of the <Col N="1282" /> schools in question are listed in the following table.</P>
    <P>To-date, a total of 65 schools have implemented the scheme and have appointed their escorts.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some schools have expressed concerns at the burden involved in undertaking the scheme. Such concerns have been the subject of discussions between officials of my Department and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education  &ndash; NABMSE &ndash; which represents the management authorities of the schools in question.</P>
    <P>Arising from these discussions, my Department has advised the schools that savings which have resulted from the non-appointment of escorts over the period September to December, 1999 could be used to engage administrative assistance with the introduction of the scheme. The schools were also advised that any savings resulting from escort duties being less than the assumed six hours per day could be used to acquire administrative assistance. My Department also advised the schools that arrangements could be made for the local bus contractors delivering the transport services to arrange for substitute escort cover in the event of an escort not reporting for duty on a particular day.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some practical difficulties may still arise in individual situations and my Department will make every effort to address such matters. However, as Minister for Education and Science I am firmly of the view that the schools which cater for these special needs children on a daily basis are the most appropriate bodies to undertake the operation of the escort scheme. The schools are familiar with the children's needs. They are dedicated to the children's welfare and in my view are best placed to ensure that the escort scheme operates in a manner which ensures the safety of the children and provides parents with the reassurance they require.</P>
    <P>I would therefore call on those schools which have not yet done so, to proceed with the appointment of their escorts in the interests of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>The following is a list of schools currently refusing to implement the scheme;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> Minister for Education and Science </P>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): As was stated in reply to the Deputy's earlier question, my Department does not fund extra curricular activities undertaken by special schools, such as the school in question. The funding of such activities is a matter for the school authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> I understand that the announcement to which the Deputy refers may relate to comments made at a briefing provided by the Irish Watersafety Association. However, I understand that there are no plans at present to provide free swimming for all national school children.</P>
