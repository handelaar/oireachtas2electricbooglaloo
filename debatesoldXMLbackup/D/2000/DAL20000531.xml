      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business today, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome to Dáil Éireann a parliamentary delegation from the Federal Republic of Germany led by Mrs. Marion Caspers Merk, MP, Chairperson of the German-Irish Parliamentary Friendship Group, who are here with us this morning in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery. On my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann I extend to you, Mrs. Caspers Merk, and to your delegation, a most sincere welcome to our country. I trust that your visit will further strengthen the ties of friendship and co-operation between our two Parliaments and countries.</P>

      <P>I wish to have the business of the House suspended today, Wednesday, 31 May 2000, under Standing Order 31 to debate the following issue of urgent public importance, namely, the revelation that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development planted oil seed rape contaminated by a genetically modified variety and the need for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with the EPA, to ensure that these crops are located and destroyed and that measures are put in place immediately to ensure no recurrence of such incidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 16<i>a</i>, Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Instruction to Committee; No. 40, International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 41, Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 42, Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 38, Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000 [Seanad] &ndash; Second Stage, resumed, to be taken not later than immediately following Private Members' business and to conclude at 11 p.m. if not previously concluded, and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that; (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 11 p.m.; (2) in the event of the motion for the by-election for Tipperary South being moved, it shall be taken without debate; (3) No. 16<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate; and (4) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 38, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11 p.m. tonight. Private Members' business shall be No. 98, motion re Eircom shares, resumed, to conclude at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals on that. The question before the House relates to the late sitting. Is that agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the by-election for Tipperary South, should it be moved, agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16<i>a</i> agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not agreed. No. 16<i>a</i> is a motion from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to broaden yet again the scope of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, which has already been broadened substantially on Committee Stage. Committee Stage has concluded, yet a raft of new amendments not proper to that Bill are to be grafted onto it and the Minister seeks the approval of the House to do so. A number of outside groups have made submissions to the select committee, but their views will not be heard if this broadening of the Bill is allowed. The Minister proposes that the full House will deal with Committee Stage today so that there will be no submissions from external bodies. The <Col N="375" /> entire immigration legislation is a bad patchwork quilt, amended and stitched as we go along, and I am fundamentally opposed to the way this is being done.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I support Deputy Howlin on this matter. It is utterly unacceptable that matters are being inserted into the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill willy-nilly to deal with immigration, asylum seekers and people who are not criminals, who are here genuinely, unlike traffickers. It is wholly unacceptable and the Dáil should not allow this to happen.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> Yesterday on the Order of Business we put down a clear marker on the way in which procedures in the House have been subverted. We have already had this in relation to the Refugee (Amendment) Bill and the Immigration Bill and now it is happening with the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill. On each occasion we debated what we understood to be the main substance of the Bill on Second Stage, but subsequent to that, on Committee Stage, sometimes near the conclusion of Committee Stage, the thrust of the Bill was changed, particularly in the case of the Immigration Bill, and now it is happening with the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill. Having reached Report Stage, a group of Committee Stage amendments is being parachuted in. That is unacceptable.</P>

        <b>:</b> The amendments alter the thrust of the Bill so the goalposts have been changed. The Bill should be returned to Second Stage and be properly dealt with. Proper procedures should be adopted and adhered to, as happens with normal legislation, particularly with a Bill such as this which deals with fundamental human rights.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach: As I stated yesterday, these amendments were clearly signalled by the Minister several weeks ago. If the legislation is to be passed in this session, it is necessary to proceed it in this way. There is no guillotine on Report Stage and Members will have an opportunity to make their points. The amendments are necessary. This is an evolving situation and the Minister brought forward proposals which were <Col N="376" /> debated at length both inside and outside the House in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a constructive suggestion in order to reach agreement on the matter. The Taoiseach said there is not a guillotine. However, there is a guillotine in the sense that Members can only speak once on Report Stage amendments and may not make further points on the amendment. Will the Taoiseach agree to Report Stage being conducted in Committee Stage format whereby Members can speak more than once? It is a compromise means of dealing with the issue and would facilitate more interchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with that proposal. The House has a select committee system to allow Members with an interest in legislation to voice their views. It is a fundamental assault on the rights of the House to introduce basic legislation on Report Stage. It is not germane to the original Bill and has been simply grafted on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>

      <P>Before agreeing to the proposal to deal with this Bill which seeks to facilitate the economic interests in the alcoholic drinks business, will the Taoiseach agree that we should conduct a parallel study on the premature deaths caused by alcohol through illness, the association between alcohol and the commission of many violent crimes and the association between alcohol and domestic and family break-up?

The amount of hardship, violence, difficulties and the number of working hours lost are also issues.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my remarks on this Bill I pointed to a number of significant assumptions which seem to run through the thinking on the International Development Association and the context in which it operates. One of the figures I cited concerns the pernicious effects of the globalisation of trade on income in some of the neediest areas. Without repeating myself, and summarising what I said the last day, when the benefits, or otherwise, of the Uruguay Round are calculated as regards trade, there is a net loss of $3 billion for Africa. The most significant gains were for the European Union followed by Japan followed by the United States. In relation to the ideologically driven liberalisation of trade, the Uruguay round brought increasing poverty and misery to a Continent like Africa.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to reflect on the other figure I quoted, which is based on a United Nations development report as late as 1996. In the period between 1970 and 1985 when gross national product on the planet increased by 40%, the number of poor increased by 17%. The number of people included in poverty statistics has massively increased. Taking account of all UNDP reports, between 1965 and 1980, 200 million people saw their income fall. At a time when that statistic has been highlighted and a near revolution is taking place that is benefiting almost everyone, between 1980 and 1993 one billion people saw their income fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the new globalised order and its trade manifestation, through the Uruguay round, has been to create significant disability for Africa in particular, Latin America to a lesser extent and that proportion of the producing world that relies heavily on primary commodities. There is no evidence of an improvement in trade conditions for those countries. There is no evidence of a real increase in incomes there, although in some parts of the world where the IDA projects are in place <Col N="388" /> one can point to certain achievements. I am not taking from that.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of perfunctoriness in the way in which IDA type motions come before different Parliaments. It is as if they can almost be waved through. This is not a negative comment about the contribution of the Minister or the Minister of State. The position is very much worse than it was. I will use the example of the Tobin tax to highlight that. The tax was proposed by Professor James Tobin, a Nobel laureate in economics. He proposed the introduction of a simple tax of 1% on speculative capital flows internationally, money that would be recycled in time to the countries that were in greatest need and it would be like, as someone put it, throwing a little sand into the machinery that is international global speculative capital flows. Global speculative capital is massively the beneficiary of the new technological revolution that enables such money to be moved at enormous speeds with terribly destructive consequences. I have not the time nor the inclination to go into that, but the example of the south east Asian economies in which more than $1 trillion of speculative capital can hover over an economy and be magnetised down, as it were, by speculative opportunity highlights my point.</P>
    <P>Professor Tobin constructed what came to be known as the Tobin tax to attach to such capital flows. It will be debated at the end of June in the European Parliament. It has been dropped by the United Nations because the Helms-Dole legislation in the United States effectively prevents people from giving donations with tax benefit if a proposal interferes with international trade. The Tobin tax which started off with a flourish through the United Nations institutions effectively has been killed by that legislation, which prevents corporate and individual contributions, including the many beneficiaries to all the UN agencies, if such proposals entertained a discussion on the Tobin tax.</P>
    <P>I mention that to puncture the air of perfunctoriness that sometimes attends the passing of IDA type motions in different administrations. Conditions have worsened in relation to international capacity and the UN's right to lead and to take an initiative. The trade benefits are not coming through to those for whom such conditions should be improved.</P>
    <P>The debt relief promised, which is much less than that sought, has not been delivered. A significant component of aid is still tied aid and much of it has been deflected into hidden exports. Aid, relief and disaster funds need to be separated from ODA programmes so that they are clearly identifiable. All Members are conscious of two factors, a moral consensus to press forward on these issues but also the manner in which strong powers, particularly the members of the Security Council, have to be put under constant pressure to ensure life opportunities for people in those parts of the planet who so desperately need them, particularly in the Continent of Africa, <Col N="389" /> especially sub-Saharan Africa with its many problems where people are literally dying as a result of economic and health reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the Bill. We have no difficulty with the Bill having moved onto Report and Final Stages. It gives us an opportunity to reflect on some of the wider issues, as Deputy Higgins did. I want to raise an issue with the Minister of State on the manner in which the IMF, in particular, moves in and the base of public expenditure from which it operates to reconstruct the economies of very poor countries, particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa. There is only one model for running an economy. Any country moving towards the free market model must take the medicine of deregulation, liberalisation of trade, reductions in public expenditure and privatisation. That is the type of recipe being imposed on the economies of very poor countries. In giving that medicine, the IMF is working from far too low a base of public expenditure. In any of these countries, especially the very poor countries, of which there is a high incidence in sub-Saharan Africa, a new formula should be agreed for deciding the appropriate base of public expenditure before a country's debt must be repaid. The essentials of public expenditure must be separated and put into another fund that can be used domestically. One element of such a fund is the allocation of sufficient resources to provide universal health services for children. Very small amounts of expenditure on public health would save the lives of literally hundreds of thousands of children in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
      <P>A second requirement of such a fund is that provision should be made for universal primary education. Allocations to provide for universal primary education and universal health care, particularly for mothers and children, together with the normal allocations for infrastructural development and to keep the nuts and bolts of what were originally state economies going are required. If a new formula was agreed internationally before a country's obligations to repay its debt kicked in, such a module of expenditure could be used domestically for those purposes. It would have a massive impact on the lives of ordinary poor people in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It is not an easy formula. It would remove the obligation on certain countries to repay their debt. Such countries are so indebted that virtually all their exchequer resources have to be used for that purpose, which leaves little, if any, resources available for essential services. We should move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in an earlier debate that Ireland could be compared to the <i>Skibbereen Eagle </i>in the sense of it keeping an eye on the Tsar of Russia, given that proportionately what we contribute is quite small. However, we have a moral authority that allows us to punch beyond our weight. We have a better forum now, as equal participants in the European Union, from which to have a better base internationally to punch beyond our weight <Col N="390" /> than we had a generation ago. We should use that base and our international leverage to make a real contribution to the international debate, which I believe we are doing.</P>
    <P>In terms of resources, Ireland's ability, even when we move to a figure of 0.7 per cent, will not change the face of the world. However, we can make a contribution to the debate which is beyond our economic strength and beyond the level of resources we can contribute. I ask the Minister, in any of the international forums in which he or the Minister for Finance are involved, to argue the case for a new formula for public expenditure in the poorest of countries so that fundamental health care and education services can continue to be provided and enhanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the contributions. It is reasonable to suggest, even though this is a short Bill, that a wide range of issues were raised on all Stages. I availed of the opportunity to respond on Committee Stage, even though there was not much of a debate, because I accept what both Deputies have said in the context of their deep interest in the subject. I too have a deep interest in it. My heart bleeds for Africa. I am one of the few Members who emigrated to Africa for many years in the early 1970s when I was 19 years of age. I know parts of it intimately. Every day I read the newspapers to see what is happening there. There are a number of reasons for the difficulties being experienced there.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Higgins's point, which was further amplified by Deputy Noonan, about how to deal with the issues. However, from my experience in the past three years in dealing with the World Bank, the IMF, the EBRD and so on, there has been a dramatic shift in the discussions and debates. Ireland has been central to that shift, although it may not be of seismic proportions. The question of how funds are spent and distributed, how loans are granted and so on has come to centre stage. It is interesting to listen to the contributions of other speakers who, even three years ago, would not have countenanced such arguments in the context of the social consequences of policies which, in a pure fiscal sense, were forced on countries and worsened dramatically the lot of people. In the past two to three years these issues have come on to the agenda and this is where Ireland has punched above its weight. The moral authority we brought to that argument and our incredible experience in bilateral relations we have had with Africa, in particular, has given us that authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success rate of small financial projects in which Ireland has been directly involved and the consequential benefit that has accumulated in areas from a small contribution can be measured against the grandiose projects of some countries which involved massive sums of money but did not achieve anything. In some cases they served to worsen the situation. As has been said, Ireland <Col N="391" /> has that sort of authority. Even in the past three years the debate in this area has changed dramatically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan made an interesting point. I have not heard it put in such direct terms previously. He is correct. Two weeks ago I attended a meeting of the EBRD, which is perhaps a slightly different forum. The issues that have been specifically pinpointed in terms of health, education and the entire social agenda in the context of eastern Europe  &ndash; I have visited most places in eastern Europe &ndash; are substantially advanced on Africa. Africa is light years behind. We have a misconception about eastern Europe; it is certainly not in the dark ages. There may be one or two bad spots but the potential for advancement at a rapid pace in eastern Europe is extraordinary. The point being made at the key forum in the IMF in regard to public expenditure is a good one and that has not previously been said in such specific terms as it was said in the House today, namely, that before the IMF or whoever seeks repayments under specific headings, public expenditure targets should be set to achieve a better standard of education and health for the nation. That is important.</P>
    <P>Another aspect about which I feel strongly, and I have changed many speeches given to me in the past three years, is that of good governance. Internally, in so many of these countries, it is deplorable what despots have done to their own people. We have seen this time and again. I see Deputy Higgins looking at me. The world has a role to play in this. It is interesting from an eastern European context to see the countries that are making progress. Before looking at any figures, the underlying reasons for their progress are the lack of corruption, a definite commitment to good governance and a system which is trusted externally on a political level and by investors. Africa has been ravaged by the leaderships that have emerged. It breaks my heart to see what is happening in Zimbabwe where I lived, given the potential of that country when it was taken over by the African people in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was capable of feeding not only itself but was known as the food bowl of Africa. All the grain reserves have been sold off for profit. There were droughts in Africa long before the 1990s. It needs planning, control and good people in power to implement such policies.</P>
    <P>This Bill has opened up an advancement in this House of which I am proud in the context of where we are pushing the agenda. I take seriously what was said on Second Stage, Committee Stage and today and I will use my offices and ask the Minister for Finance to note the central points made in this debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Howlin: The convention is that I have approximately five minutes. I move this motion with a very strong sense of the rights of this House and its Members. I believe fervently that those rights are being trampled upon by the mechanisms being employed by the Minister. I am disappointed that he will not accept a very reasonable proposal, although he has grafted in amendments that have moved very far from the urgent Bill that was presented almost a year ago, in June of last year, to deal with the issue of illegal trafficking in immigrants. The Minister presented the case that this is an emergency measure that needed the support of the House to be quickly enacted. He has used it now like a wanderly wagon to graft extraneous bits of legislation amending the Refugee Act and the Immigration Act &ndash; the Immigration Act, 1999, was itself subject to a motion like this because of the contempt the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has for this House. That seems to be copperfastened by the Minister's attitude today.</P>
    <P>It is not right and proper that fundamental legislation that has implications for human rights &ndash; we are in the process of setting up a Human Rights Commission in this State in accordance with our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; should be brought to the House as if the Members were ciphers to rubber-stamp decisions of the Executive. There is a separation of powers. It is up to the Executive to propose legislation, but it is the right and prerogative of the democratic Assembly of the people to parse and analyse those proposals for the betterment of the people. To bring in, as the Minister did yesterday, three and a half pages of amendments which fundamentally alter the nature of the pro<Col N="393" /> vision that we are debating is wrong. We have established in this House a select committee system where the great majority of people who have a view on any legislative measure have the right to make submissions. It is a deliberate policy to circumvent that right to allow those submissions to take place and then, when the people making the submissions have gone, present substantive amendments to this House on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he is somehow giving us a half-way house by allowing his new amendments to be recommitted. He knows he has no choice in that matter. The advice he has is that because they alter the nature of the Bill he cannot just drop them in here on Report Stage. They are required to be brought back into committee. That is the least the Minister can do and is required to do. Because this will be a committee of the whole House, no external body has the right to make submissions.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his response to this motion to explain the procedure he is proposing to adopt. What mechanism will he give to outside groups such as the Refugee Council, which faxed me this morning with very strong concerns about the amendments the Minister circulated yesterday, to be heard in this democratic Assembly? What mechanism will the Minister provide for those submissions to be heard in advance of the committee dealing with these amendments? Surely the only way is for the select committee which dealt with Committee Stage of this Bill to be instructed to deal with these amendments again and to allow submissions. Otherwise we will have bad law.</P>
    <P>I have much to say on this matter, but I will conclude. I genuinely believe that the Minister and his officials will be dissatisfied with this mechanism. I said this morning on the Order of Business that the whole area of law dealing with asylum seekers and immigration matters has become a bad patchwork quilt with bits and pieces being grafted on as needs arise. It is a bad way to bring in legislation of this type. I ask the Minister to think again.</P>

      <P>In this context, we have had great difficulty in getting dates for legislation at select committee in particular and in the House. That is due to pressure of business on the committee. It is certainly due to pressure of business in the House. I cannot be expected to delay these measures in the manner Deputy Howlin suggests. If I were to do so, there is no way the legislation could be completed prior to the summer recess. If I were to accede to the Deputy's request, I would be in dereliction of my duty. It is imperative that we proceed with this legislation. It is not as if I am in any way attempting to muzzle Deputies. I would have no part of that. Deputies will have ample opportunity to make their views known throughout what will be essentially a Committee Stage in relation to the amendments. I have not proposed that there should be any time limit in that respect. We have been as fair as we possibly could have been.</P>
      <P>I strongly reject Deputy Howlin's allegation that I am showing contempt for this House. That has not been my record and it is not my intention. It is true that the legislation before the House impinges upon the whole question of deportation in immigration law. However, it would be grossly misleading of anybody to imply that we are seeking to damage people's human rights. That is not the case. All I am doing is introducing measures which are deemed necessary for the effective implementation and enforcement of immigration law. In this respect, the measures which I am proposing are in no way unique. They are commonplace across Europe and the world. There is no point in pretending that what is being brought in here is some form of draconian mechanism to deal with human beings. That is not the position. Our deportation laws date back to 1935 when the Aliens Act was passed. It has been abundantly clear for a protracted period of time that we cannot operate immigration law under the Aliens Act, 1935.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 7, after &ldquo;1996,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND THE IMMIGRATION ACT, 1999,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment to the Long Title of the Bill is related to amendments Nos. 22 and 25, also in my name, the primary purpose of which is to make changes in the laws as regard the deportation process arising out of the practical experience gained in operating the present procedure. That experience, the facts and figures of which I will be detailing, demonstrates a need to refine certain aspects of the Act if the deportation process is to function effectively. To assist in our debate, it would be useful to outline the current procedures, how they operate in practice and the problems that have been encountered to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal, first, with some of the basics of immigration law and policy. It is a well recognised principle of the sovereignty of states generally that they have the right to determine which non-nationals should be admitted to their territories, on what conditions and for what duration, and to <Col N="400" /> determine when non-nationals should leave and, if necessary, remove them. Irish courts have recognised that the Executive has a responsibility, in the interests of the citizens of the State, to exercise such controls on non-nationals entering, staying in and leaving our territory. Judge Gannon's dictum to this effect in the 1986 case of Osheku has been cited with approval in many High and Supreme Court judgments since, most recently by the Supreme Court in the Laurentiu case in 1999.</P>
    <P>An essential element of the exercise of this Executive function is the power to remove non-nationals who no longer have a proper basis, or who perhaps never did have a proper basis, for remaining in the State. It is interesting that in the same Laurentiu case, which found that the manner in which the Oireachtas, in 1935, had dealt with the powers of the Minister to deport non-nationals was inconsistent with the 1937 Constitution, the Supreme Court stated that the right to expel or deport non-nationals is an aspect of the common good which inheres in the State by virtue of its nature as a sovereign State; and that such a power is clearly Executive in nature and is capable of being exercised in the absence of legislation.</P>
    <P>This Executive function must be exercised in accordance with both domestic and international law and legal principle. Some of the relevant principles of international law which inform policy, practice and the development of domestic law are already well known to this House. There is the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>, deriving from the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. There are also relevant provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular Article 5(1)(<i>f</i>) which contemplates specifically the detention of those in relation to whom deportation is in process, subject to proper safeguards as to notice of the reason for the detention, access to a <i>habeas corpus</i> court procedure, and clarity and transparency in the law on which the detention is based.</P>
    <P>The United Nations High Commission for Refugees continually expressed the view that the repatriation of those who fail the asylum process and are not otherwise entitled to the protection of a state is vital to preserve the integrity of asylum as a concept and of asylum processes throughout the world, and that deportation is an essential corollary of an asylum determination process in order to ensure that applicants who turn out not to be in need of the protection of the State are not unjustly rewarded. This sentiment is echoed by the joint policy statement of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and Trócaire, published in December 1997, which, under the heading &ldquo;Grasping the Nettle of Expulsions&rdquo;, stated:</P>
    <P>The difficulties facing the Minister and the Department of Justice have to be recognised. A clear fair and efficient adjudication procedure, with all the necessary attendant safeguards, will by definition admit not only those <Col N="401" /> whose application is well-founded but also let in on a temporary basis many whose applications will be eventually adjudicated not to be well-founded. The inevitable and necessary consequence, if the system is to work properly, is that such applicants will be sent out of Ireland to some other country, i.e. deported or expelled. The nettle has to be grasped that deportation of some applicants . is an inescapable part of a fair and efficient process, and provides an essential protection for genuine cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us now look at our present domestic law in relation to deportation of non-nationals. The procedures are set out in the main at section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999. Subsection (1) of that section sets out what a deportation order is, and subsection (2) lists the classes of non-nationals who are liable to be deported. An essential feature of any fair deportation process, and one underlined by the Supreme Court in the Tang case in 1996, is the opportunity to make representations as to whether deportations should take place. In our system, under subsection (3), that feature is implemented by informing the potential deportee that deportation is under consideration and providing him or her with 15 working days &ndash; roughly equivalent to three weeks &ndash; from the sending of the notice to make submissions as to the reason he or she should not be deported. The 15 day notice period does not apply to certain categories of potential deportees who have already had access to their own special review mechanisms provided for elsewhere in statute. There is also an opportunity for the person to forgo the opportunity to make representations by consenting to deportation &ndash; availed of in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>Section 3(1) of the Immigration Act makes it clear that the deportation of a person is subject to the provisions of section 5 of the Refugee Act, that is, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, which requires that the State may not return any person to a place where his or her life would be threatened by persecution. This important provision applies to all persons liable to deportation. Along with this overriding consideration, and any representations made by the potential deportee, section 3(6) of the Immigration Act sets out a wide range of criteria which must be taken into account before deciding whether to make a deportation order against the person concerned. These criteria cover such aspects as family circumstances, the character of the person and humanitarian considerations.</P>
    <P>The decision to make a deportation order does not come out of the blue but rather at the end of a series of processes, whether they be in the asylum or immigration area. It is the final decision on the individual case, and the culmination of an exhaustive examination of the basis for the non-national's stay in the State. In particular, where the deportee is a failed asylum seeker, he or she will have gone through a procedure which consists of a thorough investigation of the claim for <Col N="402" /> asylum at first instance; an independent appeal procedure; and the process I have just described, where the person can make a case as to the reason he or she should be allowed to remain in the State despite being found not to be a refugee. Legal aid is available at State expense for the person at all stages of these processes.</P>
    <P>Once the deportation order has been made, the deportee is notified of the decision and of the reasons for it in a notice issued under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Act. That notice requires the deportee to present himself or herself to a Garda station or immigration officer named in the notice at a specific time and place for the purpose of his or her deportation from the State. The notice is sent, where possible, in a language which the deportee understands, and can be delivered personally or sent by registered post. The service of these and other notices under the Act is an issue to which I will return when discussing the substance of the amendments before us today.</P>
    <P>Where a deportee fails to comply with the deportation order, or with the notice to turn up at the specified time and place, that gives rise to a power of arrest and detention for the purpose of ensuring the person's departure from the State. That detention is subject to certain safeguards. Deportees under 18 years of age cannot be detained, and there is a limit to the length of time a deportee can be detained. A detained deportee has, of course, access to the courts by way of <i>habeas corpus </i>or judicial review. The court hearing any such proceedings can decide whether, and on what conditions, to release the person from detention.</P>
    <P>Let us look now at how the procedure has fared in practical terms since the coming into effect of the new deportation process in July 1999. A total of 1,218 notifications of a proposal to consider making a deportation order and inviting representations have issued to date. The bulk of these have been sent to failed asylum seekers, that is, people whose claims for asylum have been either rejected on appeal or turned down at first instance and not appealed.</P>
    <P>Of the number invited to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made, 715 people, that is, about 60%, did not make representations. In about half of those cases, the invitations to make representations, which had all been sent by registered post, were returned as undelivered.</P>

Of the number invited to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made, 715 people, that is, about 60%, did not make representations. In about half of those cases, the invitations to make representations, which had all been sent by regis<Col N="403" /> tered post, were returned as undelivered. Eleven people consented to deportation.</P>

Eleven people consented to deportation, that is, about 1% of the total. Another 492 people availed of the opportunity to make representations in writing within 15 days of sending the notification.</P>
      <P>To date, I have made 396 deportation orders. Of that number, arrangements for removal have been made in respect of 198 persons. There have been supervised departures of 30 people and a further seven people left the State before deportation could be effected. In another 60 cases the deportation order cannot be executed pending the hearing of judicial review proceedings initiated by the deportees.</P>

      <P>As I said, there have been supervised departures of 30 people and a further seven people left the State before deportation could be effected. In another 60 cases the deportation order cannot be executed, pending the hearing of judicial review proceedings initiated by the deportees. In a further ten cases, the deportation orders have been revoked, mainly on the advice of the Attorney General's office. Technical difficulties of various kinds, such as the need to obtain proper travel documentation, have held up the departure of the deportee in 48 cases. A further 32 deportations are currently being arranged. In the remaining 91 cases, which represent approximately 75% of cases, excluding the judicial review cases, where arrangements for deportation had been made, the deportees have in each case chosen to flout the requirement to turn up at the named Garda station at the appointed time.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>As I said, in the remaining 91 cases, which represent 75% of cases, excluding the judicial review cases, where arrangements for deportation had been made, the deportees have in each case chosen to flout the requirement to turn up at the named Garda station at the appointed time. It must be fairly clear that a substantial number went by way of judicial review. In the region of 60 out of 400 went for judicial review. In a further 117 cases, removal cannot be effected because the persons are not at their last known address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may speculate that a proportion of those <Col N="404" /> who have, as it were, fallen out of the system at the various stages along the way may have already left the country for unknown destinations. In relation to the 3,000 or so asylum applicants who have abandoned their applications and who are no longer in the social welfare system, that speculation may have a strong basis. It is also possible that some of those who have not availed of the invitation to make representations as to why they should not be deported, or who failed to comply with the requirements of a deportation order when made, may have assumed fresh identities and reapplied for asylum or are otherwise still in the State and making a living by working illegally.</P>
    <P>Whether such people are still in the State in disregard of our laws or have left to enter another state in disregard of the laws there, it is clear we have a responsibility to ensure the law of the land is observed and upheld. In particular, I am conscious of the ease with which people may travel between here and the United Kingdom, availing of, and in some cases abusing, the common travel area arrangements which are intended to facilitate citizens of these islands alone. The maintenance and protection of these arrangements is an important element of the public policy of this State. It was recognised as such by the High Court in the case of Kweder in 1992, and was considered of such a high priority that it resulted in the negotiation by Ireland of a special protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty. It behoves us to ensure to the greatest extent possible that those arrangements are not abused by people entering the UK illegally from our territory.</P>
    <P>I am also convinced of the need to ensure that access for non-EU nationals to our employment market is reserved for those who comply with the proper requirements of our law, and that the opportunities for the law abiding should not be diminished by those who flout the law. I am further concerned to ensure that the asylum process is not abused by those who apply repeatedly in different identities, clogging up the system and making life even more difficult for those who are genuinely in need of the protection of this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have statistics on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at present but we can deal with that on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The fingerprinting of asylum applicants, due to commence when I implement the Refugee Act, as soon as this Bill is enacted, will go in large measure towards eliminating that type of abuse for the future, but we need, in addition, to tackle the problems that are there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With these ends in mind, I have brought forward amendment No. 25, the aim of which is to refine the deportation system, building on the experience acquired over recent months, so as to ensure that when non-nationals have finally exhausted all processes for being allowed to remain in the State, we can see them properly off <Col N="405" /> by sending them back where they belong, where they will be less well able to abuse our immigration laws or those of our neighbours in the European Union. I have addressed this issue in a sensible and balanced way, consistent with legal principles and our obligations under international law.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions already in place ensure fair procedures and fair treatment, with proper safeguards for all non-nationals who may be subject to a deportation order. However, it is equally clear to me that a number of procedural and practical matters require addressing in order to improve the effectiveness of the process in bringing about more supervised departures. These are dealt with in the Government amendments.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the detail of the amendments. Chief among these is amendment No. 25, which inserts in the Bill a new section 10 containing amendments to the Immigration Bill, 1999. The first of these, at paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the new section 10, inserts a new subsection (1A) in section 3 of the 1999 Act. This makes the general statement of principle that a person the subject of a deportation is liable to detention in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and that this detention is for the purpose of ensuring his or her deportation from the State. This makes it clear that the Minister's Executive power in these matters, which has been long recognised by the courts, will be exercised in line with the policy and procedures set out in the Act. It is a signal to those involved in a deportation process that they run the risk, if they do not comply with the deportation order, of being detained with a view to ensuring their departure from the State. This warning message will be incorporated in the notices sent during the process leading to deportation, so that those concerned need be in no doubt of the seriousness of the business and of the risks they run by non-compliance on their part.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the new section 10 replaces the existing section 3(9)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act with a much expanded version, setting out in much more detail the sort of practical arrangements that can be made to ensure the successful supervised departure of the deportee. Under the present section, which sets out the content of the notice of the making of the deportation order, the only requirement that can be made is that the person concerned present himself or herself to an immigration officer or a member of the Garda Síochána at a specific date, time and place for the purpose of his or her deportation. That requirement is repeated in the amendment in the new subparagraph (<i>a</i>)(i)(I). Alongside that, the other sub-subparagraphs provide for a number of additional practical requirements that can be included in the notice, as follows: the production of any travel documents, passports, tickets or other documents required for deportation purposes that the person may possess; co-operation with a garda or immigration officer to obtain travel documents; the requirement to reside in a par<Col N="406" /> ticular area or address in the State while arrangements are being made &ndash; this provision has been adopted from section 9(10)(<i>b</i>)(ii)(I) of the Refugee Act and can be necessary where there is likely to be a delay in obtaining a passport from the person's country of origin; a requirement to report periodically to a specified garda station or immigration officer &ndash; based on section 9(10)(<i>b</i>)(ii)(II) of the Refugee Act and designed to ensure that the person is continuing to be available for removal once the arrangements are finalised; and the requirement to notify a member of the Garda Síochána or immigration officer as soon as possible of any change of address.</P>
    <P>These are all very practical measures, some combination of which is likely to be necessary to ensure that the deportee remains available for removal from the State on foot of the deportation order. The person must be present before he or she can be deported. He or she cannot travel without his or her passport, travel document or tickets. In many cases a person will not have a passport or travel document or it may have expired or been lost or stolen. In such cases it will be necessary to obtain a new or replacement document for the person concerned and this will require the person to co-operate in obtaining these documents, for example, completing application forms and obtaining photographs. If the person already has a return ticket, there is no need for the State to foot the travel bill, though a deportee may need to be escorted by immigration officers whose expenses will normally be borne by the State.</P>
    <P>Which requirement or combination of requirements should be applied in particular cases is a matter for decision in the circumstances of each case. In subparagraph (ii) there is a further important modification to the provisions of subparagraph (i). This simply provides that where a notice of deportation under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act includes a requirement under subparagraph (i), then a garda or immigration officer may, for the purpose of the deportation of the person concerned, make a further requirement in writing of the kind of acts set out in subparagraph (i) and this is to have effect as if it were contained in the notice under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Act. This is to cater for the situation where a deportee reports as requested to a Garda station for the purpose of deportation, but some impediment emerges which make immediate removal impossible for the time being.</P>
    <P>To give a brief example of what is envisaged by this provision, let us take the situation where a notice of the making of the deportation order under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) includes a requirement that the person presents himself or herself to the member-in-charge at Santry Garda station at noon on Saturday and to bring along his or her passport. The person fulfils the first requirement by arriving at the Garda station on time but cannot fulfil the second requirement because the passport is lost or stolen, or, if in his or her pos<Col N="407" /> session, it may have expired. Clearly the deportation of the person cannot proceed without the passport, because in most cases, the countries of origin or transit will require some form of travel document. Therefore a further requirement under subparagraph (ii) might be that the person come back on Monday, when the appropriate passport form has been obtained, followed by a further requirement to complete the passport form, to remain at the current address in the meantime and to report back in a week's time to pick the passport up and put the final arrangements in place for the journey home. If there was something in the deportee's record that suggested it, the garda or immigration officer might consider it necessary to require the deportee to report daily or every two days to ensure that the order would be complied with once the arrangements were complete.</P>
    <P>It is a practical measure designed to minimise delays due to necessary administrative detail, to ensure that the deportee can remain in his or her regular accommodation while awaiting the finalisation of the arrangements and to facilitate the return of the person as soon as that can be done. Any additional requirement must, like those in the notice of the making of the deportation order itself, be in writing, with a copy in a language that the person understands, where this is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, having consulted the Attorney General's office, that these further modifications are justified given our experience of the operation of the Immigration Act to date and the desirability of providing for these practical arrangements in the Act and that they allow for the maximum flexibility in their operation. Non-compliance with any such additional requirements will result in the person being liable to be detained for the purpose of ensuring deportation from the State.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the new section 10 being inserted by this amendment makes changes to section 5(1) of the Immigration Act, which deals with the detention of a deportee. The existing section 5(1) provides that where a garda or immigration officer with reasonable cause suspects that the deportee has failed to comply with any provision of the order or with a requirement in a notice of the making of the deportation order, the deportee may be arrested without warrant and detained. This detention is with a view to ensuring the deportation. Experience of the operation of the 1999 Act to date demonstrates the extent to which persons are prepared not to comply with deportation orders &ndash; lawful orders which have been properly made after due process. There is a clear need for greater powers of detention in order to reduce the incidence of non-compliance and to increase the proportion of deportation orders which result in the supervised departure of the deportee from the State. My proposal is to expand the grounds on which arrest and detention of a non-compliant deportee may arise. The additional grounds for detention are to be where <Col N="408" /> a garda or immigration officer, with reasonable cause, suspects that the deportee intends to leave the State and without lawful authority enter another state &ndash; in effect, to abuse the common travel area arrangements between here and the UK &ndash; and has destroyed his or her identity documents or is in possession of forged identity documents, or intends to avoid removal from the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will end this contribution within five to ten minutes. I am outlining not just the amendments, but, to be helpful to Members, I am also outlining the current law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just trying to be helpful. It is a duty of the State and my duty as Minister, in the interest of the common good in all aspects of that concept, to ensure that persons who are the subject of a deportation order comply with the requirement in that order to leave the State. It is also the obligation of the person to obey the order to leave. However, the State would be failing in its duty were it not to equip itself with reasonable measures to ensure that a person who is the subject of a deportation order does not leave the State voluntarily only to enter another State illegally.</P>
      <P>We have a particular responsibility to ensure that our common travel area arrangements with the United Kingdom are not breached in this way. I referred earlier to the High Court case of Kwaeder, and it might be useful to quote the views of Mr. Justice Geoghegan in that case:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the common travel area arrangements as between Ireland and the UK have been and are perceived by the general public to be of great advantage to this State. I, therefore, accept the submissions made on behalf of the Minister that this public policy is not merely legitimate but also fundamental. Provided proper regard is had to European Community Law such a public policy is not in any way incompatible with that law . In a literal sense, the continuance of the common travel area may not be threatened by a single or individual instance of back-door illegal immigration into the UK through initial entry into Ireland and the taking advantage of the common travel area. But an accumulation of such &ldquo;back-door entries&rdquo; would obviously threaten the continuance of the privilege. For that reason each individual instance of such back-door illegal entry or probable back-door illegal entry is a serious threat to the long-term continuance of the common travel area and it is a <Col N="409" /> legitimate act of public policy to take the necessary steps to prevent each individual instance of it.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the context of our co-operation with our other European colleagues it would, to say the least, be an unsatisfactory situation if a person the subject of a deportation order issued by a Minister in this State, for the purpose of returning to a country outside the European Union, could simply ignore the order and wander off into another EU State. This is the basis for paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the new section 5(1) in this amendment. It is modelled on similar provisions in relation to asylum seekers set out in section 9(8)(<i>e</i>) of the Refugee Act, 1996, which provides for detention in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>The amendment of paragraph (<i>c</i>) of subsection 5(1) in this amendment, which is also modelled on a provision of the Refugee Act, 1996, at section 9(8)(<i>f</i>), is designed to deal with situations where deportees seek to obstruct their deportation by destroying their travel documents or to avoid it by obtaining false papers. The amendment at paragraph (<i>d</i>) of subsection 5(1) of the Immigration Act provides for detention in circumstances where a garda or immigration officer with reasonable cause suspects that a deportee intends to avoid removal from the State.</P>
    <P>Any detention under this provision is subject to the conditions and safeguards set out in the remaining subsections of section 5. These deal with placement in a mode of transport about to depart, proper accommodation during the journey, the non-applicability of detention to persons under 18 years, provision for review by the court of a detention where the deportation is under court challenge and the overall limit on the period of detention in any case.</P>
    <P>Essential to the success of the deportation process is that people are on notice of what is happening and what may happen to them in that process. As we have seen, our procedures incorporate at every stage of the process the provision of notice to the person liable to be deported and to the deportee which keeps the person informed of his or her rights and of what is expected of him or her. Section 6 of the Immigration Act, 1999 allows for service either personally or by registered post. This can only work properly, however, where notice is sent to and received by the person at the address which that person has most recently supplied. At present it is open to a deportee or a potential deportee to try to frustrate the process by avoiding acceptance of the notice, either by moving without telling the authorities or by simply refusing to accept registered post from the postman.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the process cannot be evaded in this way, paragraph (<i>c</i>) of the new section 10, being inserted by amendment No. 25, modifies section 6 of the 1999 Act to provide that the person concerned will be deemed to have received the notice three days after that notice has been sent by registered post or any other form of recorded delivery to the last address provided. <Col N="410" /> This provision could not work effectively, however, unless provisions were in place to ensure that there was a responsibility on the individual concerned to ensure that the authorities are kept abreast of that person's up-to-date address. Those provisions already exist for non-nationals under the Aliens Order, 1946.</P>
    <P>Article 11 of that order requires them to register with the Garda Síochána including particulars such as name, nationality, date and place of birth, address in the State and a requirement to notify his or her registration officer and An Garda Síochána of any change to the particulars provided for the purposes of registration. A person who is registered is given a registration certificate which records these particulars and any changes to them and also records any permission to remain in the State granted to the person.</P>
    <P>For asylum seekers, the Refugee Act, when it is commenced shortly after the passage of the current Bill, will provide a somewhat different system. Section 9(3)(<i>a</i>) of that Act provides for the issue, by the Refugee Applications Commissioner, of a temporary residence certificate stating the name and other personal details of the applicant and containing his or her photograph. Section 9(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Refugee Act provides that a person issued with such a certificate shall be deemed to have complied with article 11(1)(<i>a</i>), that is, the requirement to furnish certain particulars for registration purposes.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act provides further, at section 11(8), that the Refugee Applications Commissioner on receipt of an application under the Act must give to an applicant a statement in writing specifying a number of requirements, one of which includes the obligation upon the applicant to notify the commissioner of his or her address in the State. However, the Act as it stands has no express provision requiring the applicant to provide his or her address to the commissioner. For completeness, I propose a further amendment of the Refugee Act, amendment No. 22, to spell out this obligation on asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Finally, amendment No. 1 changes the long Title of the Bill consequential on the inclusion, by way of amendment no. 25, of a section amending the Immigration Act, 1999. I framed this set of proposals, in consultation with the Attorney General, to take account of the climate of international human rights law so that there will be sufficient safeguards for the rights of the individual, to ensure that those who are willing to obey the lawfully made deportation order by co-operating with their removal will not be detained and to provide sufficient powers to ensure the law is upheld in the interests of society generally. I am confident that in combination with the establishment by the Garda authorities of the new Garda national immigration bureau and the increased Garda resources being devoted in the area, these proposals will result in a higher level of compliance with the law without diminution of the rights of individuals.</P>
    <P>I propose to keep this area of the law under <Col N="411" /> constant review and I am determined to give it whatever strength is needed to ensure its effectiveness consistent with the administration of justice. I urge Deputies to support the amendments.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>&mdash;we have listened to a Second Stage presentation outlining what the Minister sees as the imperatives for bringing forward these amendments.</P>
      <P>What is happening here is disgraceful and undemocratic. Of all the issues on which we have had a useful exchange of ideas with representative bodies, none has provided more of an opportunity or demanded such an input as that of immigration, asylum and refugee policy. During the debate on the Immigration &ndash; or deportation &ndash; Act last year, which was a hotch potch measure to fill a gap that resulted from a constitutional challenge to the 1935 Aliens Act, we had a useful exchange with various relevant bodies such as Amnesty International, the Refugee Council, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Irish Episcopal Commission. Their views were enormously valuable in sensitising Members to the issue, in informing the debate and in enabling Members bring forward amendments which were eminently suitable and sensible in terms of ensuring that the Bill had balance or proportion.</P>
      <P>However, at the end of the Committee Stage debate we were presented with a raft of amendments which changed the dynamic and thrust of the Bill. Members put down a marker at that time that they would not permit that to happen again. However, it has happened again with the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill. On Committee Stage a huge tranche of amendments, which changed the thrust of the Bill, was put down at short notice by the Minister. We thought that this was surely a line in the sand as far as the Minister and Members were concerned. However, that line has vanished again.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, we were given another raft of amendments. They were not posted to Members. The list is dated 30 May 2000 and was issued by the General Office. It is the Minister's expressed intention to change further the thrust of the Bill. That is disgraceful and undemocratic. The Minister claims it is fair but it is an abuse. Even if one leaves aside fair procedures, good manners should have dictated that Members be told in advance what the Minister intended to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> As Deputy Howlin pointed out, this Bill was published last year. We are not responsible for the fact that it took months to reach Committee Stage. Committee Stage was completed over Wednesday and Thursday, 29 and 30 March 2000. The House is now in the final phase of this session or on the home straight, as it were, and on the eve of Report Stage of the Bill, Members have again been saddled with a raft of amendments. That is simply not good enough. The Minister is responsible for the fact that we were not given the amendments on time. He knew that changes were being contemplated. Whatever difficulties have arisen in relation to deportation procedures did not suddenly arise yesterday or last week. They were known for a considerable period of time. To parachute these amendments into the Bill without notice and to expect Members to deal with them in a proper, democratic and instructed fashion is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister has delivered a 30 minute speech, part of which was tightly compacted with statistical detail. The Members are expected to absorb its minute details and to respond in a cogent fashion. I have major problems with the amendments and with what the Minister is doing. Amendment No. 25, for example, provides for the tightening up of the procedures adopted under the Immigration Act, 1999. Section 3 of that Act, which deals with deportation orders, states:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of section 5 (prohibition on<i> refoulement</i>) of the Refugee Act, 1996, and the subsequent provisions of this section, the Minister may by order (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;a deportation order&ldquo;) require any non-national specified in the order to leave the State within such period as may be specified in the order and to remain thereafter outside the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that what he is doing today will refine the deportation system. What he is doing here is setting down a whole range of strictures to ensure that anyone who is the subject of a deportation order is under constant surveillance from the moment the deportation order is made. I accept the principle of deportation orders. I accept that if there are procedures and laws in place and if we abide by our international obligations, where people do not meet the requirements set down in international or domestic law, in certain circumstances, deportation is an option. One of the reasons the Minister finds himself in this present bind is the slowness and tardiness of the existing procedures, the fact that people are in this country for two, three or four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers constantly to the fact that he inherited a very difficult situation and that he is being blamed unfairly for failure of the procedures to work. One of the reasons he is having difficulties with deportations is his tardiness in dealing with the procedures. People are in this country for two, three or four years languishing <Col N="413" /> in a legal limbo. They are not allowed to work. Their applications are not being processed and, as a result, they have become embedded in Irish society. They have become part and parcel of the regime. They are living here and they have become grafted onto Irish society. The result is that when it comes to making deportation orders, they see themselves as part and parcel of this society because the Minister has failed to invoke the procedures within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>On the new regime being introduced, I thought section 3 was more than adequate. The person must now present himself or herself to such member of the Garda Síochána or immigration officer at such date, time or place as may be specified in the notice. Therefore, the person is told exactly where and when he or she must report. The person must produce any travel document, passport, travel ticket or other document in his or her possession required for the purpose of such deportation to such member of the Garda Síochána or immigration officer at such date, time and place as may be specified in the notice. In other words, not only will these people be deported and their stay here terminated within the terms of the deportation order, but they must now report to their executioner on a regular basis to remind him they are in this country and are ready, available and about to be deported. They must co-operate in any way necessary to enable a member of the Garda Síochána or immigration officer to obtain a travel document, passport, travel ticket or other document required for the purpose of such deportation. They must reside or remain in a particular district.</P>
    <P>Therefore, these people are told exactly where they must stay, their location and the confines within which they must reside. They must report to a specified Garda station or immigration officer at specified intervals pending removal from the State. I have no doubt these people will be told to report on a daily basis until such time as their exit order is invoked. They must notify such member of the Garda Síochána or immigration officer as may be specified in the notice as soon as possible of any change of address.</P>
    <P>The Immigration Act was quite adequate because section 5 states that where an immigration officer or member of the Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause, suspects that a person against whom a deportation order is in force, has failed to comply with any provision of the order or with a requirement in a notice under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii), he or she may arrest him or her without warrant and detain him or her in a prescribed place. Further additions are now included whereby an immigration officer or a member of the Garda Síochána who, with reasonable cause, suspects that a person against whom a deportation order is in force has failed to comply with any of the provisions of the order under section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii), intends to leave the State and enter another state without lawful authority, has destroyed his or her identity documents or is in possession of forged identity documents, or <Col N="414" /> intends to avoid removal from the State, may arrest him or her without warrant and detain him or her in a prescribed place.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that failing to comply with any of the provisions of the order &ndash; these are very detailed and were debated at length on Committee and Report Stages of the Immigration Act &ndash; would be sufficient. However, there is now a further set of conditions, including if the person intends to leave the State and enter another state without lawful authority. How does one prove that these people are going to enter any other state without lawful authority? The Bill includes the wording if the person &ldquo;has destroyed his or her identity documents or is in possession of forged identity documents&rdquo;. In other words, if the person decides not to return to some regime which in the view of the authorities assessing the applications is not seen as punitive and where the person would be subject to discrimination, and if the Department gets it wrong and the person decides he or she will not return to the country with the identity documents because of the obvious consequences, that person will now be subjected to arrest without warrant and detained in a prescribed place.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Minister's proposals and the <i>ad hoc</i> approach to immigration and asylum policy has one intention, that is, to deal with it on an instalment basis, to send out at convenient times convenient soundbites to give the distinct impression that Ireland is increasingly becoming a no go area for asylum seekers and that asylum seekers simply are not welcome here.</P>
    <P>The next amendment amuses me. The 1996 Act states that where a notice is required or authorised by or under the Act to be served on or given to a person, it shall be addressed to him or her and shall be served on or given to him or her in some one of the following ways where it is addressed to him or her by name, by delivering it to him or her or by sending it by post in a pre-paid registered letter or by any other form of recorded delivery service prescribed by the Minister, addressed to him or her at the address most recently furnished by him or her to the Minister or in a case in which the address for service has been furnished to that address. We are now saying that if it is three days from the expiry date of the dispatch of the envelope, that is it. As far as the Department is concerned, the person has been given due notice. In other words, that is an absolute certainty or guanantee that the person has been in possession of the document. We are well aware, given the vagaries of the postal system which has deteriorated rather than improved in terms of service since the days of the threepenny stamp, that accidents happen and post goes astray, even registered post can go astray. However, the Minister is proposing in this legislation that, as long as three days have expired since the letter was dispatched in the post by his Department, the assumption and presumption is that the person has received it, therefore, he or she will receive the red card and be out the door.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> I am amused by the removal of the reference to the Minister. It is now proposed to furnish the information to the applications commissioner. In other words, we are putting the Minister at a remove from what is happening here. This is another way of immunising the Minister in relation to his involvement, even though ultimately he has sole responsibility for the entire application of the procedures which have been invoked in this draconian measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister delivered a half hour speech more appropriate to Second Stage. I welcome this and think we should all be given the opportunity to start again given the substantial and far-reaching amendments. Since they will become part of our legislation they deserve to go through the procedures laid down for the enactment of legislation. The stages in debating a Bill include starting with a debate on the principle, then moving to Committee Stage which is followed after a time lapse by Report and Final Stages. The Minister has repeatedly sought to circumvent that established procedure in relation to immigration, asylum seekers and related matters, which is quite wrong.</P>
      <P>I will talk about the procedure and the content of the amendments. The Minister is acting outrageously in terms of procedure and he and his officials are aware of this. In recent days I have spoken to staff of his Department. I understood the amendments would be ready last Thursday, but they were not available until yesterday. If the Minister was on this side of the House he would be as upset as I and other Members at being treated in this way. We have been presented with substantive and far-reaching legal texts 24 hours before Report Stage. In his heart of hearts the Minister knows that is no way to do business and that it is unfair to Members. These amendments were brought forward after we had submitted our amendments on Report Stage and two months after the conclusion of Committee Stage. It is wrong to treat the House in such a way and I do not know why it is repeatedly happening in relation to these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law is a bad patchwork quilt and we are grafting on bits and bobs to whatever vehicle happens to be handy. The appropriate vehicle last year in the opinion of the Minister was the Immigration Act, 1999. We went through the same procedure whereby a very straightforward Bill designed to deal with plugging a loophole after the Supreme Court ruled provisions of the Aliens Act, 1935 were unconstitutional, was used as a vehicle to do far more. The Minister uses whatever legislation is before the House at the time to add bits and bobs of policy. He has repeatedly refused to bring overarching immigration legislation before the House. What was promised for this year in the most recent comments by the Taoiseach on the Order of Business is now being promised for next year and the Minister is fast <Col N="416" /> realising he will not be around to introduce a Bill at that stage.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to treat the House in this way and it is not fair on Members or Opposition spokespersons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was allowed 35 minutes to give a Second Stage speech. There should be some allowance for Opposition spokespersons to at least vent frustration since our legislative role is being circumscribed by the Minister. The Minister knows my arguments are correct and are not too different from the arguments he would make if he was on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The amendments were received by Members yesterday and those who would like to have made comments and submissions on them to the Select Committee were not given a chance to do so. We are required by the Minister's tactics to deal with them now, and I am very displeased with that.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned by the contents of the amendments. I agree with the general comment of Deputy Higgins that the Minister likes the notion of presenting sound bites to the media and to present himself as the strongman in these matters while grossly and deliberately misrepresenting the views of the Opposition, as he again did last weekend when he insultingly referred to office holders in the political parties on this side of the House. He included a reference to the president of my party as being in that position for life. There is no office of president for life in my party &ndash; the president is elected at national conferences of our party. Such a derogatory comment is typical of a Minister who has nothing else to say on issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is the longest serving Minister with responsibility in the area of justice of the most recent three Ministers. With the exception of two and a half years, Members of Fianna Fáil have been Ministers for Justice since 1987. It is about time he took some responsibility rather than constantly harping back to a previous Administration. As many as 85% of asylum seekers have arrived here on his watch. Deputy Higgins is correct when he says the Minister's policy is botched. There are people here three and four years awaiting a determination of their legal status. Last Saturday an individual came to my office who is married to an Irish national and is four years in the State but whose situation is not yet regularised. The Minister is responsible for ensuring applications are dealt with in some semblance of a speedy way. I hope he will take responsibility rather than constantly trying to off-load to somebody who preceded him, given that <Col N="417" /> he has been in officer longer than his two immediate predecessors.</P>
    <P>I support the notion of deportation for those who have no right to be here. I have not ever said anything different in the House and have not heard a Member of the Opposition say differently &ndash; I speak authoritatively as spokesperson of my party. We are talking about the mechanism by which determinations are made about who can lawfully remain here and how deportation orders are implemented.</P>
    <P>I support amendment No. 22 and do not have any difficulty with it. However, amendment No. 25 is a different kettle of fish. It revisits the powers to deal with people whose asylum applications have been refused. This morning I received communication from the Irish Refugee Council, which barely had a chance to examine the measures now before the House. The council asked me to be mindful of its representations which state:</P>
    <P>The Irish Refugee Council is seriously concerned at the manner in which the proposed amendments and the increased powers of the Garda in relation to deportation and detention have been introduced. The Irish Refugee Council notes that these amendments were introduced a day before they were scheduled for discussion in the Dáil; that this has taken place without any opportunity for human rights organisations to make comments on the proposed amendments; and if implemented would have a serious impact on the rights of unsuccessful asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>There are organisations which have a legitimate right to be heard and I regret that many other organisations have been denied that right because of the tactics employed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The statement continues:</P>
      <P>These amendments represent a stringent tightening of the rights of unsuccessful asylum seekers to access legal remedies in the Irish courts. Inability to access legal remedies could potentially result in a breach of the principle of &ldquo;non-refoulement&rdquo; providing that no person should be returned to a country where their life or liberty would be at risk. The increased power to detain where is a &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo; that the individual will not comply with a deportation order is not adequately qualified. Detention of individuals may therefore occur entirely at the discretion of a member of the Garda Síochána. There is no provision for access to any review of this decision.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will have regard to this.</P>
      <P>I have tabled four amendments to amendment No. 25 which deals with the Immigration Act, 1999, the first of which relates to the new section 10(<i>a</i>)(i) which reads:</P>
      <P>(1A) A person the subject of a deportation order under this section may be detained in accordance with the provisions of this Act for the purpose of ensuring his or her deportation from the State.</P>
      <P>That is a general statement of principle. I propose to delete this subparagraph as there are no safeguards implicit in what the Minister is suggesting. Detention may be immediate notwithstanding the fact that the person concerned may apply for leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds. He or she may still do so from a place of incarceration.</P>

      <P>It was agreed to group the amendments for the purposes of debate. I am seeking to delete the new section 10(<i>a</i>)(i) under which a person against whom a deportation order has been served may be detained regardless of whether he or she has applied for leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds. It seems there will be no time limits on the period of incarceration. If such a proposal was to apply to citizens of the State there would be an outcry. Despite the inclusion of the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo; in his title the Minister seems to be of the view that human beings the subject of deportation orders may be treated differently in terms of the scale of the rights from citizens of the State. This is regrettable.</P>
      <P>A person detained under section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, may be detained for a period of eight weeks but this will not apply to those detained under the new section 10. I am seeking in amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 25 to create such a time limit in circumstances where I cannot strike down the new powers of detention. I suggest a time limit of 48 hours, save by order of a court. The Minister will say that such a person will be able to apply for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> but it is wrong and unacceptable that under subparagraph (ii) a garda, if he or she has a suspicion on a range of matters, may take a person into custody. That is a matter of the gravest concern.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 25 seeks to delete subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) in the paragraph proposed to be substituted by subparagraph (<i>a</i>)(ii) of the proposed new section under which a garda who effects an arrest will have the power to attach new conditions to a deportation order. I am very concerned about this. It raises questions in terms of the separation of powers. The relevant subparagraph reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the notice under subsection (3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) contains a requirement to do an act specified in subparagraph (i), a member of the Garda Síochána or immigration officer may, if he or she considers it necessary for the purpose of ensuring the deportation of the person concerned from the State, require the person in writing to do any one or more of the acts specified in subparagraph (i), and any such further requirement shall have effect as if it were a <Col N="420" /> requirement in a notice under subsection (3)(<i>b</i>)(ii).</P>
    <P>I am concerned that a garda or immigration officer who has effected an arrest or detention will have the power to attach new conditions on the spot.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 25 seeks to delete paragraph (<i>b</i>) in the subsection proposed to be substituted by paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the proposed new section. This is a point on which Deputy Higgins touched and which needs amplification. The Minister is giving the power of arrest and detention to a member of the Garda Síochána or an immigration officer where he or she suspects that the person the subject of a deportation order intends to leave the State and enter another state without lawful authority. Does this mean that the Minister wants to have arrested an asylum seeker who entered the State through the port of Rosslare and against whom a deportation is in force even though he or she voluntarily wants to get back on the boat from whence he or she came? It strikes me that he or she should not be prohibited from doing so. What is the logic behind this proposal? Is the Minister of the view that he is required to do this on foot of his discussions with the UK authorities on the common travel area? On first reading it does not strike me as a particularly sensible proposal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider his reply? The visit to Poland has nothing to do with the EU Summit and I suggest he takes Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together, followed by Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive. These two groups of questions deal with separate issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take a separate supplementary question if the Deputy wishes.</P>
      <P>I undertook an official visit to Poland from 24 to 26 May as the latest visit in my programme of meetings with our future partners in the Union. The purpose of the visit was to strengthen bilateral political and economic relations with a country that will be shortly a member of the European Union. I believe it was highly successful in this respect.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, Poland is one of the larger and most advanced of the EU accession candidates for membership of the Union. My visit presented a timely opportunity to build on our already strong relations prior to its accession. I took the opportunity of the visit to indicate our strong support for Poland's accession at the earliest possible date, among the first wave of new entrants.</P>
      <P>My visit commenced in Warsaw where I held discussions with President Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Buzek and the Speakers of the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament. While, inevitably, the main focus of my discussions were bilateral issues and progress on Poland's accession to the Union, I also discussed a wide range of other issues including the Intergovernmental Conference, EU-Russia relations and the Ukraine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reflecting the growing importance of the Polish market, I was accompanied by one of our largest ever international trade missions consisting of more than 40 businesses from a wide range of sectors. Their presence underlined the fact that there is a growing interest among Irish business people <Col N="422" /> in developing trade and commercial links with Poland.</P>
    <P>In addition to my official meetings, I hosted a working breakfast for Poland's top business leaders, representatives of companies on the accompanying trade mission and local Irish businesses to discuss Ireland's recent economic performance and the further development of trade between Poland and Ireland. I also hosted a reception for the Irish community in Poland. Before returning to Dublin I travelled to CRH's plant in Ozarow to inaugurate the largest cement kiln in Europe. In addition, I inaugurated a number of projects for other Irish businesses expanding their operations in Poland.</P>
    <P>The next European Council will take place in Santa Maria da Feira, Porto, on 19 and 20 June. No formal agenda has been circulated for the meeting as yet. The issues and how the Presidency plans to approach them will gradually become clearer as Feira approaches. Prime Minister Guterres will not conduct a tour of capitals in advance of Feira, but I will be in telephone contact with him in relation to the issues on the agenda. There are no plans at present to table a discussion paper on the issues likely to arise at Feira nor have we, as yet, received any from other Governments for the meeting.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the ongoing discussions at the Intergovernmental Conference will be a major issue on the agenda as this matter is passed to the French Presidency for conclusion. The draft charter of fundamental rights will also be discussed and the chairman of the convention, former President of Germany, Mr. Herzog, is expected to deliver an oral presentation at the summit. I also expect that follow-up to the special European Council in Lisbon, as regards the Union's development of the information society and a knowledge based economy, to feature prominently in the discussions.</P>
    <P>While I have not spoken recently to either French President Chirac or Prime Minister Jospin in relation to the priorities for the French Presidency, I met the French Minister for Finance, Mr. Laurent Fabius, in Dublin on 11 May where we had an initial discussion of the programme for the French Presidency. Minister Fabius also met the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, while the Foreign Minister, Deputy Cowen, met the French Foreign Minister, Mr. Vedrine, on 22 May. These contacts identified some issues of which we were already aware, such as the Intergovernmental Conference, the charter of fundamental rights, ESDP and enlargement. I am also aware of the speech by Prime Minister Jospin to the National Assembly on 9 May which outlined the aims of the French Presidency as: a Europe which delivers on growth and full employment; a Europe which is closer to the people; and a stronger and more effective Europe. I support these aims and we will give every assistance to the French Presidency in achieving them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Taoiseach think of the French President's proposal for a European rapid reaction force of 60,000 troops? Would Ireland be willing to contribute to such a force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the conclusion of the Helsinki discussions allowed for the deployment, arrangement and organisation of a force similar in size to that in Kosovo. President Chirac has spoken of a new European rapid reaction force for the north Mediterranean region. A number of multilateral forces already exist involving various EU members, including Euro corps, in which five European countries participate.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council set a voluntary target for establishing capabilities solely for crisis management situations under the Petersberg Tasks. This was known as the &ldquo;headline goal&rdquo; which member states aim to meet by 2003 and allows for the deployment of 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days of being called upon to do so. The proposal also allows for sustaining such a force for at least 12 months. This would equal the position regarding KFOR in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>In his speech yesterday, President Chirac said France would work to develop the criteria to enable this target to be met. He is probably talking about the same effort as that agreed in Helsinki. The Helsinki conclusions make clear this does not imply the creation of a European army and states that such a development can take place only under the Petersberg Tasks agreed in the Amsterdam Treaty, which is on a voluntary basis. The matter of sovereignty will be decided by each country in its own case. That is what President Chirac was talking about and we have no difficulty with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Helsinki arrangements and agreements under the Petersberg Tasks involving crisis management situa<Col N="424" /> tions, two committees were set up &ndash; the political committee and the military committee. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, attends the military committee. These committees are examining the logistics. Our numbers will depend on what happens as regards our 23 or 24 year commitment to Lebanon. As the year progresses, that will become clearer. I know the Minister for Defence is anxious to deploy our complement of troops and, I hope, he will be able to deploy more on the other side of Lebanon than otherwise he would have been able to.</P>

The Taoiseach said he led a substantial delegation to Poland comprising of business interests across a range of sectors. Arising from his reply and for the purpose of clarity &ndash; I know the Clerk of the Dáil is listening to the question I am posing &ndash; can I take it that any parliamentary questions tabled to the Department of the Taoiseach on the co-ordination of Ireland's co-operation with the applicant member states, including the PHARE programme or anything else related to the applicant member states, will be answered by that Department?

The Taoiseach led a comprehensive delegation to Poland encompassing a broad range of interests and participated in a range of activities, as is his responsibility as Taoiseach, which I fully endorse and support. If Members wish to table questions to the Taoiseach arising from that set of activities, they run the risk, without clarification from the Chair, that matters relating to industry, education, or some other sector are deemed to be the responsibility of a Minister who was not in Poland in the first instance <Col N="425" /> and we get a nonsensical reply to a legitimate question.

If I or another Deputy tabled a question to the Taoiseach arising from his visit to Poland and comments arising from it and that question was transferred to another Department, will the Taoiseach clarify that if he answered questions on our responsibility for a co-ordinated approach to our relationship with an applicant member state of Poland's significance that subsequent questions will not be deferred or referred by his Department? I accept that the Ceann Comhairle's office does not have responsibility for the transfer of questions, but the Taoiseach's Department does.

It is often the case that a question is tabled to my Department on a matter that comes under a sub-head of a Vote of my Department, but my Department does not deal with that matter. The practicalities of such a matter are dealt with by another Minister, but I take such questions because they come under a subhead of a Vote of my Department.

      <P>According to a newspaper report, the Taoiseach was asked by the Minister with specific responsibility for European integration in Poland, Mr. Jack Zaryusz-Wolski, if Ireland was prepared to give a specific time commitment as to when it would like Poland to become a full member of the European Union. Was the Taoiseach accurately reported in that article? Was that question posed to him as distinct from being anticipated and reported by Denis Stanton in <i>The Irish Times</i>? If the Taoiseach was asked that question, what was his response?</P>

      <P>The Prime Minister and the President of Poland welcomed the statements we made supporting Poland as a member of the first group of countries that would join an enlarged European Union. There are two bases for our support, which I emphasised on national programmes when I was in Poland. It has fulfilled the ongoing negotiating position with which the Commission must be satisfied. It is our view that Poland can satisfy the regulations laid down for accession. If the negotiations are completed and it signs up to the regulations laid down, it should be included in the first group of countries to join the Union.</P>
      <P>My view, as stated in Helsinki, is that negotiations should be completed by the end of 2002. President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Schro1eder are pressing that and believe they could be speeded up. I do not think that will be possible but they should be completed early in 2003. Based on the negotiations on all 29 Chapters being completed at that time and on Poland being able to fulfil all the criteria laid down&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations will commence in June on the Chapters on the Common Agricultural Policy. Poland has not had discussions on those yet. I was privileged to meet all of the negotiators, including the key negotiator on the agricultural side. I was seated next to him at a State lunch and he outlined to me in great detail that Poland had to get agreement within the country from the various agricultural interests including big farmers, medium sized farmers, peasant farmers, as they are known and the industries to prepare a paper on the matter. That paper has only been completed and a final draft form of it came before its Government in the past week of two. <Col N="427" /> It is hoped to bring that to the Commission and start negotiations on it at the end of June.</P>
      <P>The negotiators are not under any illusion that those negotiations will be not be difficult. The Commission indicated that it will not sign off on the agricultural direct payments issue until the Chapters are completed and negotiated. Poland would like it to do that up front, but the Commission made it clear that it will not do that until it ascertains that Poland has the ability and the capabilities to deal with the other issues. For our part, and in reply to Deputy Quinns's question, we accept, as do other member states, that Poland has the capabilities to deal with those issues, but these matters have to be formally negotiated.</P>

Subject to the conditions outlined by the Taoiseach, can I take it that all the negotiations are completed, that the Commission is satisfied that Poland has the ability to administer the <i>acquis communitaire</i> and that Ireland would support Poland's request for entry by January 2003, if the criteria for entry by that date have been met?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the current boycott of Austria being operated by the other EU members, without any EU authority but on a bilateral co-ordinated basis, will continue after Porto? Is it still the Government's policy, as outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Austrian Government should be judged on its performance rather than on its composition? If so, will he indicate what has been wrong with the performance of the Austrian Government since it came to office to warrant the continued snubbing by the Department of Foreign Affairs of Ireland of the Austrian ambassador in Dublin?</P>

      <P>I have reported on this issue a number of times. The up-to-date position is that the measures of the 14 member states were discussed by the EU Ministers in the Azores on 6 May. The Minister for Foreign Affairs with the Danish Minister and maybe one other Minister expressed the view that there should be a review of the situation in the hope that we could move on from this position either before Feira or after it. I have since spoken to the Portuguese Prime Minister in relation to the issue. We confirmed we would like to move on if he can find a basis of doing it. A number of other countries have also expressed that view. He is reviewing the process and is consulting the partners. We have said we would support moves to relax it if he can get a majority to agree. I do not know whether that will happen prior to Feira. My information is that the matter will not be discussed at Feira, it is not intended to discuss it. There is still a strong resistance to any move by Belgium, France, the Netherlands and a few other countries.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that Ireland is free to make its own policy on this matter, that we are not obliged by the decision of the other EU members because this was not an EU decision? This was a decision taken outside the EU structures without due process, without a hearing for the accused, namely, Austria, being granted as is normal in due process, and Ireland can make its own decision on the matter. What does the Taoiseach think this continued boycott is achieving?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it absolutely clear that we are not going to act on our own. That is the reason all 14 members states made the decision they made on 14 January. I still think it was an effective decision. It gave an added impetus to the President of Austria to lay down firm conditions about how the administration would work. The administration is at pains since to point out that it is complying with the conditions set down by the President, at the behest of the Union. That shows the success of the measures. There is a downside to continuing the boycott indefinitely because it puts pressures on Austria in other ways. It is doing its best to comply. For that reason there should be discussions but we will not make a unilateral decision on our own. We will work on a compromise with Anton Guterres and if he cannot succeed in having a compromise the position will remain as it is. I hope he will succeed. He is endeavouring to do that and we support his efforts.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline any way in which Austria is not complying with EU requirements in relation to human rights or any other issue? Will he accept that Austria may wish to raise this matter at the Portuguese summit? Would the Irish position be defendable in the light of statements made by Government backbenchers in relation to asylum seekers here? I have a question on the Portuguese summit and another on the Polish visit. Does the Taoiseach accept that decisions can be taken at the Portuguese summit in relation to unanimity among member states? What is the Government's view of the pressure coming from France and Germany to remove the requirement for unanimous decision-making? Is the Government of the view that loss of unanimous decision-making would increase the likelihood of a two-speed EU in relation to the single currency, Schengen and other aspects of EU development? Given that the main headlines in Ireland following the Polish visit related to the Taoiseach's response to Mr. Haughey's revelations at the tribunal about donations, is it true that apart from that the Taoiseach discussed environmental concerns in Poland, as reported? Given that the Irish Government is facing legal proceedings by the European Commission in relation to its appalling record of environmental protection, was that matter raised and, if so, was there a response from the Polish Government?</P>

We talked about the environmental issues of the Ukraine and the concerns and costs to the Polish economy. Poland is anxious to comply fully with all environmental matters but there are many realities that have to be dealt with, including <Col N="430" /> costs, which are enormous. While Poland does not have nuclear power stations, it has much infrastructure which will take a considerable number of years to deal with. They are subject to negotiations. We are taking a constructive approach to extend qualified majority voting. We are prepared to extend it further. We were prepared to do so during the Amsterdam negotiations in areas such as industry, transport and culture. Each article must be considered on its merits. There are certain areas, including taxation, where unanimity is essential. Other than that we are prepared to be helpful in trying to move ahead. Qualified majority voting and the general voting position are all part of the overall equation about what will happen about large countries losing their second Commissioner. If they lose their second Commissioner, which they must in order for us to retain our Commissioner, they will seek changes in qualified majority voting and in the weighting of votes.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is illogical for the European Union to impose a sanction to obtain a result and continue to impose the sanction even though it has obtained that result? That is what the Taoiseach has just said. He said the sanctions were justified to get Austria to agree to the declaration. Now that it has done that the sanctions are still being maintained. What logic lies behind that approach which is a freely taken decision of the Irish Government and not something imposed on it by the other 14, because each country acted individually in this case? The Irish Government is snubbing the Austrian Ambassador. The Taoiseach should consider what would happen if all the other countries snubbed the Irish Government. Would it not result in rallying around the Government and a strengthening of extremism in the country rather than a weakening of it, because countries do not like to be bullied by bigger neighbours? Does the Taoiseach agree it is time Ireland showed the courage his party has shown on foreign affairs matters in the past? I doubt whether the ancestor of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands would have agreed to go along with a consensus of this nature to the detriment of a small country.</P>

There is no discussion yet on specific re-weighting models in the current negotiations but I imagine that as soon as the French take over in July that will change. During the Amsterdam process we were prepared to accept a modest re-weighting of votes in the context of the overall round. However, we are concerned at how it will be done and how it will affect the institutional arrangements. There are dangers in that. As regards what happened in Amsterdam, we were prepared to hold the second commissioner and have somebody waiting but the institutional linking of that is what concerns me.</P>

      <P>The National Competitiveness Council published the third Annual Competitiveness Report on Friday 26 May. This monitors Ireland's competitiveness relevant to our main trading partners and competitors using a broad range of statistical indicators. The council also published the Competitiveness Challenge 2000 report which contains a series of recommendations to the Government on action required to maintain and improve competitiveness. These <Col N="435" /> recommendations are presented within the framework of the seven priorities which the council has identified for its work &ndash; social partnership, people, costs, infrastructure, telecommunications and e-business, competition and regulation, and science and technology. The council has placed particular importance on swift and effective implementation of required changes and measures. In this regard, it has emphasised the importance of implementing the national development plan and accelerating the modernisation of the public service through the Strategic Management Initiative.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for copies of both reports to be placed in the Oireachtas Library. The Government greatly appreciates the work and advice of the council and relevant Ministers will give careful consideration to its recommendations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Timmins raised this matter with me some time ago. In 1830 the population of Glendalough was around 1,800. The public had access to St. Kevin's Bed which is part of the Glendalough settlement and a very important site for hundreds of years. Some time ago there was a proposal to give a licence to allow a boat to <Col N="437" /> operate across the lake which would be in accordance with environmental conditions but that was dropped. The Department of Defence rescued 10 people since 1995 from the face of St. Kevin's Bed. Does the Minister not consider that as this is an important element of the Glendalough site it should be part of the presentation of what the site has to offer and, as people climb the cliff through dangerous terrain to reach it, St. Kevin's Bed should be accessible to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>The site may be accessed by climbing up a cliff face from the lake shore which is ten meters below. The north facing cliff face is composed of brittle and greasy rock and more rescues have to be carried out there than from any other site in the Wicklow Mountain National Park. This continues to be a problem despite fencing and warning notices that have been placed on the eastern and western approaches to the site. As the Deputy said, the site is easily visible to visitors from the miners' road in the Wicklow mountains national park, but the provision of any form of access is not an option due to factors such as lake depth, safety, technical feasibility, high cost, maintenance, disturbance, and environmental and visual impact. We must take safety factors into account at all times and because of these issues I feel the matter of access should not be considered at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of making a statement. Sceilig Mhichíl off the Kerry coast, which is a wonderful location, is accessible and well presented by the Minister's Department. What is the Minister's objection to making St. Kevin's Bed accessible when she is aware that despite the warning signs in place, people will continue to climb up to it? Surely, accessibility to St. Kevin's Bed should be part and parcel of presenting the entire story of Glendalough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is interested in ensuring that people have access to the maximum knowledge about St. Kevin's Bed and that such knowledge would probably be augmented by a visit to the site itself. I can understand that view but as I have already said, more rescues have been carried out there than at any other site in the Wicklow mountains national park. It is a dangerous site in terms of its position and I have already mentioned the lake shore which is ten metres below. Unfortunately, fencing has not deterred some people from trying to ascend that area, as a result of which they have got into all sorts of problems and have had to be rescued. It <Col N="438" /> is not an option at this time because of the factors I have referred to, including the depth of the lake and other safety requirements. While costs are involved, safety requirements and the environmental and visual impacts of work that would have to be undertaken, are the immediate concerns. Because of that I am not considering the provision of public access to the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the fact that most rescues take place there not make the case for better access to St. Kevin's Bed? The cost of flying a Dauphin helicopter is £1,425 per hour and the aircraft flew 15 hours of rescue missions there in the past three years. It is a fact of life that people will continue to climb there. For generations, families used to boat visitors across the lake to the site. The Minister should re-examine this matter and visit the site herself to formulate her own view. In accordance with good practice, her Department would be well able to provide an environmentally sensitive and safe access to St. Kevin's Bed.</P>
      <P>If an operator applied to the Department for a licence to operate a boat on the lake in accordance with best environmental practice, would the Minister be prepared to consider that as a means of providing the first point of access to the site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about being able to provide a controlled safe environment for anyone who wants to access that site. Because of the safety regulations it would not be possible to provide a sufficiently safe environment for people visiting the site. That is the reason I made my earlier statement in reply to Deputy Kenny.</P>
      <P>I have not seen any proposals to operate a boat on the lake, but if the Deputy is aware of someone who wishes to make such proposals to my Department I will examine that question. While the safety requirements of such a plan would have to be assessed, I would welcome any proposals by the Deputy, or by a constituent of his perhaps, and I would revert to him in the normal way.</P>

      <P>I have not yet received the report of the facilitator. The facilitator was engaged by me to promote a common understanding among RTE, the RTE trade union group (TUG), and RTE network employees likely to transfer to the new DTT entity, of the public policy objective of Government in relation to the introduction of DTT in Ireland, the factors that must be taken into account in the achievement of this objective and to facilitate the presentation of information to me on the positions of these parties. He has had ongoing contact with all the par<Col N="439" /> ties concerned in recent weeks and I expect to receive his report within a matter of days.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, difficulties have arisen in the process of establishing a DTT entity as originally envisaged. I have been forced to consider alternative approaches with a view to moving the project forward in a manner most likely to achieve the successful establishment of the DTT platform. The facilitator's report to me will be important in informing the development of proposals to move the project forward.</P>
      <P>In principle, I would favour publication of the report following Government consideration of the issues raised by it. However, until such time as I receive the Report and have had an opportunity to assess whether it contains commercially sensitive information or any other information whose publication might jeopardise the successful introduction of DTT, it would not be appropriate for me to give a specific commitment in this regard.</P>

Major difficulties are obviously being encountered and the passage of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, is being delayed. It appears the cable and MMDS operators are increasing their market share all the time. Are we heading towards a situation where commercial operators will not find it worth their while to take up options on the various channels and multiplexes that will be available?

      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that I had hoped to have a report from the facilitator within three weeks. I certainly hope to have the report within days. It would be wrong for any of us to conclude that the delay is due to some disagreement among the parties involved in that facilitation process. Mr. Phil Flynn is extremely busy with a number of other issues, but I am also aware that he has met all the groups involved and will be in a position to present his report as soon as possible. I hope that will be in a few days.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Shea when he says we should avail at the earliest possible moment of this window of opportunity presented by digital broadcasting. That is my wish and, in fairness, I know it is also the position of RTE. I look forward to receiving the report from the facilitator. I have promised that once I received the report and assimilated its contents I would have a meeting with the RTE authority. I certainly do not intend to take any great length of time in doing this. I have every intention of pushing this matter forward as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I met representatives of United Christian Broadcasters, known as UCB Limited, on 23 May 2000. My understanding of UCB's position is that its primary concern is to secure a licence from the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulator, the ODTR, to retransmit its satellite Christian radio service. UCB is of the view that its proposed service does not and should not come within the remit of the Independent Radio and Television Commission. I understand that neither the ODTR nor the Independent Radio and Television Commission agrees with UCB on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the meeting, I explained that both the ODTR and the Independent Radio and Television Commission are statutorily independent and, as such, I could not interfere with the decisions of either body, nor am I in a position to offer an opinion on their interpretation of the legislation under which they operate. I undertook, however, to give further consideration to the possibility of addressing the concerns of UCB <Col N="441" /> by way of an amendment to the Broadcasting Bill, 1999. I will be in touch with representatives of UCB in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>UCB was very pleased to have the one to one meeting because I understand it had tried to access Ministers in the past with regard to this responsibility but did not get an opportunity to do so. A position has been taken by the ODTR and by the Independent Radio and Television Commission but there does not seem to be agreement among UCB, the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the ODTR as to the way forward. Obviously those bodies are independent and I am in a position to undertake to give further consideration to the possibility of addressing the concerns of UCB by way of amendment to the Broadcasting Bill. An interesting point on this is that it became clear to me from the meeting with UCB that it wanted a transmission licence from the ODTR rather than a contract from the Independent Radio and Television Commission or even an amendment to the Broadcasting Bill. It would seem, if I am interpreting the message correctly, that a retransmission licence from the ODTR is UCB's priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The ODTR has refused to issue a transmission licence and the failure by any other Christian orientated stations to obtain a contract from the Independent Radio and Television Commission has also been noted, but as the Deputy will know, it is not for me to comment on the decisions of either body. I understand also that UCB has indicated that it is seeking a judicial review of the ODTR's position. That would seem to be its priority but on foot of our discussion on these issues, I will examine whether it is possible to resolve this matter by way of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply. It was decent of her to meet UCB which has carried out an extensive lobby of Deputies from all sides of the House. I see no harm in its broadcasts. I heard them a few times and that kind of presentation meets a need within sections of the community. The Minister has stated the position accurately. The ODTR and the Independent Radio and Television Commission disagree with UCB on its interpretation of what should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the committee chaired by Deputy Carey, both the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the ODTR gave evidence to that committee. During the presentation by the ODTR, the regulator indicated clearly that under the new Bill it would be the remit of the Indepen<Col N="442" /> dent Radio and Television Commission to deal with issues like this one, and I believe the Independent Radio and Television Commission accepted that. UCB's position is that it wants to know, under the existing 1988 radio and television Act, if it is possible for the ODTR, as a separate entity, to issue a retransmission licence under the 1988 Act, as distinct from the 1999 Bill to be introduced, because it is the remit of the ODTR to allocate spectrum and the remit of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to allocate the licence. The Minister has stated the position accurately. Will she confirm if it is possible for the ODTR to issue a retransmission licence now under the existing 1988 Act as distinct from what will happen in the future?</P>

      <P>As I follow the argument, Deputy Kenny is right in the way he has presented the particular responsibilities of the ODTR and the Independent Radio and Television Commission. However, it is not for me to interpret the legislation on this issue. Obviously the ODTR and UCB have been in discussion on this matter and under the existing situation perhaps that is something that could be discussed further but it is not for me to either interpret the legislation or give any direction as this body is statutorily independent.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the recent report by Birdwatch Ireland which showed that the number of bird species which are endangered in Ireland has increased by 50% to 18 in the past seven years; the steps being taken to ensure the survival of endangered species; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 152 of 12 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that Birdwatch Ireland, together with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Northern Ireland, has carried out a study to identify Irish species which are in decline. A summary of the findings was published in the March edition of <i>Wings</i>, the newsletter of Birdwatch Ireland. My Department recently received from Birdwatch Ireland a copy of a final draft of the <Col N="443" /> paper entitled Birds of Conservation Concern in Ireland, which will be published shortly in the journal <i>Irish Birds</i>, Vol. 6, No. 3, 1999. I understand that the <i>Wings</i> and draft <i>Irish Birds</i> articles show 18 Irish species as red-listed, that is, species which have suffered a 50% decline in the past 25 years. While six of these red-listings relate to the North, concerns as to the conservation status also exist in the Republic where they are amber-listed. The paper is currently being examined by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. On completion of this examination I will be in a position to fully consider the findings and identify necessary remedial actions.</P>
    <P>There are already a number of measures in place to protect endangered birds. All birds are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976. Designation of special areas of conservation and special protection areas under the EU birds and habitats directive further strengthens the protection of all birds, endangered and otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the statistics and information contained in the report are highly disturbing and that there seems to be one underlying difficulty, namely, the changes in farming methods, whether in terms of fewer cereal crops, the elimination of hedgerows or whatever? Will she not agree that before she got the final draft &ndash; because she already had the essential information &ndash; she should have entered into immediate urgent discussions with her colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to develop strategies to arrest and reverse this decline?</P>

      <P>My Department has ongoing discussions with the NGOs, including BirdWatch Ireland, and has been addressing these problems on an ongoing basis where resources have been available. I referred in my reply to the red list which contains 18 species. I will not read them all out but that information can be given to the Deputy if he wants it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it &ndash; no doubt it brightened his day. Of the 18 red listed bird species, the first six have been prioritised for conservation action. In some cases, this conservation action has taken place over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know about the very difficult situation there was in relation to the corncrake and the need for immediate preservation. Dúchas has provided major funding for the preservation of corncrakes and has established special areas of conservation, including areas such as the Shannon callows, to ensure they will be looked after. The decline in corncrakes is considered to be due primarily to, as the Deputy said, agricultural intensi<Col N="444" /> fication. Schemes such as REPS and provisions to look after hedgerows are extremely important if we are to continue to look after our birdlife. That is why I made special provisions for hedgerows in the wildlife legislation we debated in the House last week.</P>
    <P>In regard to the roseate tern, the Department, in partnership with BirdWatch Ireland, has been running a programme of research and conservation at these colonies for over ten years. This programme has been very successful, resulting in a threefold increase in the roseate tern population.</P>
    <P>The hen harrier is another bird that needs conservation. My Department, along with BirdWatch Ireland and other groups, is completing a national breeding census of the hen harrier, which I am told is a scarce bird of prey. This will enable the identification of important core areas where conservation measures can be implemented.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware it is the intention that the station be established as a separate statutory entity and that the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, when enacted, will provide me with enabling powers to make the necessary arrangements. The station has recently produced a three year plan for an enhanced service in the context of its establishment as a separate entity. The plan envisages a substantial increase in its existing base level funding over a three year period. My Department is considering the plan at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy an idea of the funding that has been available since 1997, which was the station's first full year of broadcasting. The Department provided £10.2 million in current funding at that time, £11.6 million in 1998 and £14 million in 1999 by way of grant aid. A total of £1.3 million in capital funding has also been provided over that three year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TG4 came to see me to discuss its new three year programme, which is ambitious. It was interesting to note that it wants to be in a position at some stage to become a separate statutory entity. Some nervous remarks might have been made, not necessarily by the station but by commentators who would be well disposed towards TG4, when the Broadcasting Bill was first published. The nervousness concerned the question of the separation of TG4 from its parent, RTE. However, there is now a strong wish that the sep<Col N="445" /><Col N="446" /> aration would take place, on foot of consultation and further funding. I am looking at this&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the plan submitted by TG4 is being assessed in her Department at present. Can she give us an indication of when that assessment will be completed? Does she not agree that the comprehensive service provided by TG4 is being done on a shoestring of £14 million per year compared with SC4, which provides a similar service in Wales and receives £100 million sterling per year? TG4 is performing miracles on a nightly basis. If is allowed become a separate entity, what arrangements will be made to provide adequate funding? It is scandalous that it is dependent on the same level of funding it was getting three years ago when it was first established. I do not know how it is able to continue to provide such a level of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not depending on the same level of funding as it was in 1997. As I said in reply to Deputy Deasy, the funding increased to £14 million for 1999. I am the first to say that those in TG4 are doing tremendous work. They are mostly young people and they run a very tight ship. It is an example of how things should be done in many cases.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of funding, RTE is allocating one hour of programming a day to the Irish language. However, TG4 wants to broadcast six hours of quality Irish language programming a day, including the one hour of programming now on RTE. This increase in hours would mean that TG4 would have to commission and acquire new material, which will cost a great deal. I met with TG4 some weeks ago and I will consider and assess its proposal. I will have direct talks with the Minister for Finance and put forward the views expressed by TG4. I am prejudiced in this regard as I would like to help in any way I can because I recognise the work done by TG4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister will not be able to answer this. I am concerned about the effectiveness of the teaching of Irish in second level schools. As a modern medium of communication, TG4 should be used to a greater extent in that context. Irish is taught for 8,000 hours per <Col N="447" /> day by 3,500 teachers and the effectiveness of this must be queried. Will the Minister look at the impact of TG4 as a communicating method for teaching Irish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny that TG4 has an important role in educating not only the young but everyone in the Irish language. It is seen as a living language in that medium, which can incorporate young and old. I appreciated that fact before TG4 stressed it once again in its presentation. For the reasons outlined by Deputy Kenny, I would like to see how we can promote its case, which I will present to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the action she will take arising from the recent report of the Heritage Council which found that important archaeological treasures were at risk because of inadequate site testing by archaeologists; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to her written Question No. 50 on 12 April 2000. As I indicated in that reply the Heritage Council report, Review of Archaeological Assessment and Monitoring Procedures in Ireland, notes that the standard of archaeological test excavation and of the reports submitted is not as high as we would wish it to be. However, it does not necessarily follow from this that important archaeological treasures are at risk since testing is just the first stage in the archaeological resolution of a site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Archaeological testing is carried out to determine the nature, extent and complexity of the archaeological structures, features or deposits that may exist on a development site. In the majority of cases, test excavations are carried out by machine-dug trenches to the top of stratified archaeological deposits. Any further excavation to determine the depth of the archaeology is carried out by hand. The report submitted on the results of the test excavation is used to determine the requirements for further archaeological exca<Col N="448" /> vations, avoidance of impacts or preservation<i> in situ</i> of structures or features.</P>
    <P>However, I should point out to the Deputy that in some cases, there may be mitigating reasons why there may be less than accurate results from testing. For example, in urban areas, it may not be possible to carry out adequate test trenching at an early stage in the development process because of the presence of existing structures on the site prior to their demolition or the sites may be small or there may be neighbouring buildings. On large green-field sites, the excavation of a number of narrow test trenches may not give an accurate picture of the archaeology as testing in such cases is a hit and miss affair. The stripping of topsoil under archaeological supervision is a more productive method in such cases.</P>
    <P>It has not been possible for my Department to maintain the level of its programme of inspecting archaeological test excavations in line with the hugely increased pace of such excavation work taking place on foot of the upsurge in development activity in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>It is clear from the Heritage Council report that there is a desire amongst the private sector archaeologists for more inspection and advice from my officials.</P>
    <P>However, I believe that the profession also needs to look at its own self-regulation and to ensure that proper standards are adhered to. It is to be expected that archaeologists will fulfil their role in a professional manner on foot of work licensed by my Department but unfortunately, this is not always the case. My Department cannot be held responsible for particular cases where sub-standard archaeological work by a licensed archaeologist is reported but licences can be, and have been, withheld subsequently if the terms and conditions of a previous licence have not been met by a particular archaeologist. It, therefore, remains a matter between the archaeologist and their client to provide an appropriate level of professional service while acting with the law.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am currently examining ways to address these deficiencies. I am in the process of recruiting additional archaeologists and considering a repositioning of existing resources so as to introduce a programme of systematic site inspections and I am confident that this will have a significant beneficial effect on standards. Other initiatives involving a streamlining of the licensing system, a series of seminars and a set of guidelines on procedures and standards to be followed would also be desirable and will be pursued in conjunction with my plans to take on the additional archaeologists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's reply, does she not agree it is appalling that the report commissioned by the Heritage Council states that 34% of our archaeological monuments have been lost since 1840 and are currently being lost at a rate of 10% per decade? This calls for a number of urgent measures, not least that protection is <Col N="449" /> carried out effectively under the provisions of the National Monuments Act, 1994. There is a need for archaeologists at all levels. Even though it is not the remit of the Minister's Department, each local authority should have an archaeologist. The archaeology section, Dúchas, should be allocated more staff. Otherwise, we will lose a huge part of this very important heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that we were already aware of the views expressed by the Heritage Council. It was acknowledged by everyone that more archaeologists were needed to deal with the increase in building and the need for further development because of the Celtic tiger economy. There has been an increase in demand for archaeological licences in recent years. I ensured the Department cleared the backlog of these licences and that eight archaeologists will be recruited on a two year employment contract. Interviews for those positions are expected to take place soon. We need more archaeologists and I was happy to receive the approval of the Department for Finance to employ more personnel to deal with this ongoing issue.</P>

However, in relation to the transmission of sites, my Department has formally transmitted 268 SACs and it is important to remember that one does not need to wait for transmission to or registration with Europe to ensure the areas are protected; special areas of conservation are protected the minute these are published and there are provisions for the prosecution of those who do not adhere to the guidelines.</P>

      <P>I am coming to the Deputy's question. When it comes to monitoring, it is important that conservation guidelines are adhered to. I have said on other occasions that I hope not just to have more personnel in my Department, which would be the optimal way of dealing with this, but there are also many local organisations such as heritage groups and local authorities that show a great deal of interest in this area and which could be of huge help using their skills to monitor sites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's claims to be able to comply with the deadline, which I would love to be able to believe, can she assure the Commission, as much as this House, that amendments to the sites designated as special areas of conservation will be made on scientific and not economic grounds, which is the view of many people when they observe what has <Col N="451" /> happened? Will she also tell us what she will do to ensure that damaged sites &ndash; which she claims are protected &ndash; are restored, given that this damage is also an issue on which the European Commission is seeking to bring us to court? This is not just a matter of designating numbers of sites but is also a matter of the quality of the protection we are giving. Does she agree that our quality of protection leaves a great deal to be desired?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>The quality of protection is obviously an important issue and that is why it is most important to emphasise at every opportunity that it is not just a matter of waiting for the designation of sites by Europe to ensure these sites are protected. Once published, these sites are protected in law.</P>

      <P>I have taken a number of prosecutions and others are lined up. Also, this is not a matter of a deadlock in the Department regarding the transmission of sites. The reason it may seem there is a delay is that I wanted a fair and transparent process. This process was put into action when the Minister of State and I took over this Department by ensuring there was an appeals system headed by the former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills. There are not only landowners involved in the appeals system but also conservationists, so all groups have a say within the structure.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure that that system is fully used before the sites are transmitted and they are transmitted once they have gone through the procedure. The Deputy can be assured that decisions on whether an area is part of a SAC or not is made purely on scientific grounds.</P>

I hope to have the report by the end of June, which will give me some time to look at it and to come back here in the autumn. It obviously depends on how long the consultants take, but if they stick to that programme and report by June we should be able to meet the autumn deadline.</P>

Sé an fhadhb atá ann ná an brú atá ar an nGaeilge taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht fiú sna Gaeltachtaí is láidre. Tá Coimisiún bunaithe agus is ábhar do cheist eile é nár shroiseamar cathain a bheimis ag súil le tuarascáil ón gCoimisiún. Tá sé ráite go poiblí ag an Rialtas nuair a bhunaigh siad an Coimisiún go raibh súil acu go mbeadh tuarascáil acu faoi cheann bliana. Tógfaidh sé an méid sin ama leis an obair a dhéanamh agus is é ról an Choimisiúin, ní a bheith ag tarraingt línte ar léarscáil, ach féachaint cén bealach is féidir an Ghaeilge a láidriú taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí atá ann agus <i>inter alia</i> ceist na dteorannacha a scrúdú.</P>

Caithfidh tú smaoineamh gur tharla rudaí nádúrtha, daoine ag pósadh isteach agus ag pósadh amach agus mar sin de.

    </Speaker>
    <P>While no one on this side of the House is opposed to the concept of deportation, we have recognised in all our contributions here and elsewhere that this is a natural and necessary part of any sensible immigration policy. We wish to ensure that we do not deal with the issues facing society in a way which breaches the normal high standards in relation to personal rights which the courts and the Oireachtas have long and jealously guarded. Aspects of the Minister's proposals trespass upon those. I welcome his observations on the points I made and I hope we can make progress on amendment No. 25 if he is minded to <Col N="457" /> accept the modifications I am suggesting.

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>): This Bill began its life as the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999. The Minister is seeking to amend the Bill by including the word &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; in the title. He is trying to subvert the English language and the proper procedures which should be observed in the Dáil when dealing with the legislation. This is an extremely chaotic way to deal with the legislation. We began with an Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, the purpose of which is to make it an offence to exploit vulnerable people. There is a possibility that criminal gangs of no morality and no respect for human rights use poor and desperate people in this way. However, to turn this into a type of immigration Bill is a procedure which subverts the way in which we should deal with the legislation. The Minister's actions are prejudicial to innocent people seeking asylum in this country and making their case to the authorities. The way in which the Minister is circumscribing people's rights in the Bill and lumping those in with a Bill which is primarily supposed to deal with the criminal trafficking of human beings is prejudicing the rights of the victims of traffickers. This matter should be given serious consideration.</P>
      <P>I was surprised at the Minister's language this morning on deportation. He used the phrase, &ldquo;. people go through the procedures&rdquo; and &ldquo;Send them back to where they belong&rdquo;. This portrays enormous contempt for people who 99% of the time were forced to flee their own country for reasons of persecution of one kind or other. When the Minister used such language this morning, he portrayed a certain contempt which has informed many of his and the Minister of State's speeches in the Dáil. Soon after this Dáil came to power, they made assertions that 90% of asylum seekers were bogus, a word they used on many occasions. This is very prejudicial to people seeking asylum who do so in the understanding that their case is correct and justified. The fact that a tribunal or authority of the State finds they are not to be granted asylum does not mean their claim was bogus. The Minister and his Department should change their language and approach. The words used in the amendment to give the Garda new powers to deport people should not be used in that context. The words &ldquo;Send them back where they belong&rdquo; is the language of every xenophobe and racist in Europe in relation to people of different racial origins and different colour skin from the majority of white people in the EU. This begs the question, should the 100,000 or 120,000 illegal Irish youths in the United States have been sent back to where they belong?    </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 is extremely sinister given <Col N="458" /> that the Minister is inviting police representatives from Nigeria, a country from which people come to seek asylum, to be part of the deportation process in relation to people who are refused permission to stay in this country. This is incredible given that Nigeria is an extremely repressive regime, rather than a normal democratic State, with a police force which is known to be repressive, reckless and extremely heavy-handed in relation to political dissent.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 provides a mechanism by which the Garda will co-operate directly with the police, in this instance from Nigeria, to return people who have fled from that country, many in fear of their lives and certainly of their safety. To give the Garda the power of summary arrest under amendment No. 25 in the way outlined is intolerable and makes it very difficult for people in an extremely vulnerable situation. We saw shades of what can happen with the early morning raid of a house in west Dublin by the Garda with the family, barring one member who was staying with relatives, being incarcerated in the Bridewell. Will we have a situation where an adult member of a family who goes to a Garda station to fulfil one of the requirements laid down by the Minister will be arrested there and then without warning, because a garda forms the opinion that the person may not obey a deportation order? That is the power being given to the Garda through this amendment. It would create an intolerable situation in terms of human rights and the welfare of individuals and their families.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister to take this approach. It is not acceptable for him to insert into a Bill, which is supposed to deal with criminal activity, mechanisms to deal with immigration. If immigration legislation is necessary then it should be drafted and there should be a full discussion on it. It should not be done through overnight notification of substantial, far-reaching and serious amendments which have human rights connotations. As was said by other Deputies, it is very wrong that many Irish people &ndash; not that nationality should be of critical importance &ndash; who deal with the welfare of asylum seekers and refugees have not had an opportunity for a wide-ranging discussion. Laws should evolve from wide-ranging discussions between Deputies and experts and those most <i>au fait</i> with the subject matter. By not allowing such a discussion to take place a very important voice is missing from the debate. That voice could either be heard directly by committees of the Houses or, at least, indirectly, provided there was time for a comprehensive briefing of Members by organisations which cater for the human welfare and legal and human rights of refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>It is a bad day's work and all I can do is alert people to that and oppose what is being put forward. I hope the Minister will reconsider his approach and acknowledge it is mistaken and damaging to those who are vulnerable and in need of support and assistance rather than repres<Col N="459" /> sive legislation which is opposed to the process of creating a democratic society informed by human rights and humanitarian concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being accused of making long speeches, I will deal with the amendments tabled by Deputy Howlin and then with the contributions of the three Opposition Deputies. It will then be open to each of those Deputies to make further contributions as the Bill has been recommitted. I have always wanted a full and frank discussion and have always tried to facilitate this irrespective of what people might say to the contrary.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 to the amendment is opposed. The purpose of this provision and new section 10 is to provide a clear declaration in statute of the factual legal situation, namely, that a deportee is liable to be detained on foot of a deportation order, that detention is in accordance with the very detailed provisions set out in the Act and that such detention is solely for the purpose of the deportee's removal from the State. Detention will only arise where a deportee fails to co-operate in his or her removal from the State in circumstances set out in section 5(1) of the Immigration Act as amended by my amendment.</P>
      <P>The power of detention in cases of deportation is a feature of immigration systems across the world and the Irish system is no exception. Given that deportation is an Executive function, as recognised by the courts on many occasions, the power to detain in pursuit of securing compliance with a properly made deportation order is also a function of the Executive. This provision makes it crystal clear, in line with ECHR requirements, that a detention power should be transparently prescribed, that the power to detain exists, that it should be exercised in line with the policy and procedures set out in the Act and that it exists to achieve the aim of ensuring the deportation of a person from the State and for no other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 to the amendment is opposed. Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999 already contains detailed provisions in relation to the detention of persons who are the subject of a deportation order, including the non-detention of minors in these cases under section 5(4) and that no person shall be detained for a period or periods exceeding eight weeks in aggregate. This amendment imposes a stop on those endeavouring to execute a deportation order which can be of no constructive purpose. An order signed by a Minister is valid and can only be made after the processes set out in section 3 of the Immigration Act have been gone through. The subject of the order always has the right to institute judicial review proceedings regarding the correctness of the procedures leading to the making of an order. Section 5(5) of the Immigration Act provides for court review of detention where a deportation order is under challenge and section 5 of this Bill provides a specific statutory basis for <Col N="460" /> judicial review in immigration and asylum cases, tailored to the needs of such cases.</P>
    <P>In relation to detention in a prison or Garda station, there are well enshrined processes for obtaining legal assistance on demand: the 1987 custody regulations in relation to Garda stations are an example. There is, accordingly, ample opportunity after detention to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court to initiate <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings or an application for judicial review. There is little point in providing an alternative process here which would simply serve to impose an unnecessary procedural hindrance to the execution of a deportation order lawfully made which is not being complied with by the deportee. It would impose a huge burden on Garda time, soak up court resources, consume resources in our Department and would be a drain on the Exchequer in the form of barristers' fees, all for no productive purpose. It would advance the interests of the deportee not one jot or tittle beyond the already perfectly adequate protections which exist under the Constitution and otherwise in our laws in the form of <i>habeas corpus</i> and judicial review remedies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin's amendment No. 3 to the Government amendment is also opposed. This provision is a common sense proposal to allow for the making of practical arrangements for the deportation of a person, requiring of him or her that he or she do certain things necessary to secure the departure of the person. No more than the making of a business trip or organising a family package holiday, the supervised departure of a deportee does not happen miraculously. In each case it is necessary to put a series of very practical mundane arrangements in place, making sure that flights are booked, bags are packed, documentation is in order, and so forth.</P>
    <P>For the supervised departure there may be other special needs such as secure transit arrangements in an airport en route which do not arise in the normal journey. These arrangements take time, effort and the co-operation of the person involved before they fall into place. Yet, the Deputy proposes to excise from my amendment the provision that will ease the making of these arrangements and encourage the co-operation of the deportee, but he offers no constructive alternative as to how this might happen.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake, that is precisely the purpose of the Government amendment. The existing provisions in section 3(9)(<i>a</i>) of the Act are not sufficiently broad to cater for the making of these arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the example of the person arriving in a Garda station without travel documents and being required to return, perhaps several times, so that the practical business of obtaining such documents can be completed with minimum inconvenience to the deportee. These <Col N="461" /> are the types of circumstances envisaged by subparagraph (ii).</P>
      <P>The requirement in subparagraph (iii) to convey these requirements in a language the person understands is hardly seriously opposed by the Deputy. To delete these provisions would effectively leave in place the current difficulties being encountered daily in securing compliance with the requirement to leave the State. The alternative would be automatic detention in every case to ensure implementation of the deportation order, hardly an alternative for which the Deputy would wish to argue. In the circumstances he might consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
      <P>The effect of the provision which the Deputy wishes to delete by amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 25, which is opposed, is one which addresses principally the protection of the common travel area arrangements which exist between this State and the United Kingdom. The State has an obligation in the public interest to protect and maintain these arrangements. I quoted the comments of the High Court in the Kweder case in which Mr. Justice Geoghegan recognised the fundamental public policy aspects of the need to act in every case to ensure these arrangements are not threatened.</P>
      <P>The effect of this provision is to enable a garda or an immigration officer to prevent the abuse of the common travel area arrangements by a deportee seeking to evade deportation to the country of origin. It will also be effective in ensuring the immigration laws of our EU partners are not similarly abused by someone who wishes to avoid being sent home. It is hardly the aim of the Deputy to facilitate such abuse; that would be the effect of accepting his amendment to the Government proposal. I hope he will agree and see fit to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>Figures for multiple asylum claims in the State are naturally incomplete since the current means of detecting such claimants, based primarily on comparison of photographs of each applicant taken when they apply, are unreliable and impractical when dealing with the current volume of applicants. There have been detections, largely fortuitous or the result of admissions volunteered by the individual in question, of double, triple and sometimes quadruple or higher applications. I will endeavour to obtain more detailed figures and communicate them to Deputy Higgins later.</P>
      <P>What exactly is wrong with requiring a person the subject of a properly and lawfully made deportation order to do whatever is necessary to ensure the order is complied with? What is being proposed is a series of practical measures to ensure the deportation process works better. The figures clearly demonstrate that rates of compliance with the law of the land, not some aspiration, are low. This is not fair on society. It seems that it brings the law of the land into disrepute. As legislators, we have a duty to make changes to the law of the land if it is the case that the system does not work. There is nothing mysterious or wrong with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> On the arguments advanced regarding the procedures used, the amendments are in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House. If they were not it is clear that we would not be here. They are being discussed in a democratic way in a democratic forum. That is as it should be. The amendments are needed now to deal with high levels of non-compliance with deportation orders and the deportation process generally. I do not exactly relish deporting people but it is the law of the land and of most other lands also. There is no great mystery about it. I would prefer to be bringing forward these proposals in the context of the comprehensive framework of the immigration and residence Bill being developed in the Department, but unfortunately the amendments cannot wait.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins appears to cavil at the provisions set out in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of amendment No. 25. It is important to remember that these provisions are practical and designed to facilitate deportation. They may be used singly or in any combination and will clearly operate to the benefit of the person who wishes to comply with a deportation order.</P>
    <P>There is no question of a person the subject of a deportation order being sent to a place in which he or she will be persecuted as Deputy Higgins suggested. If an individual is an asylum seeker he or she will have gone through the entire process which is both detailed and has regard to full consideration of his or her case. There is an independent appeals mechanism and legal aid is provided throughout. Section 3(1) of the Immigration Act requires that each deportation order be made subject to section 5 of the Refugee Act which relates to the prohibition on <i>refoulement</i>; in other words, not alone can an individual not be sent back to a country where he or she may be persecuted, neither can an individual be sent back to a country if that country can deport the individual to a place in which he or she may be persecuted. I cannot see how it could be much fairer than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins mentioned that a huge raft of amendments were tabled to the Immigration Bill, 1999, following Committee Stage. They were tabled on Committee Stage for the purpose of making the Refugee Act, 1996, workable. They were tabled by me because it had become perfectly clear on Second Stage that Deputies on all sides of the House were in favour of such an approach. There was full consideration of the amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins betrays his contempt for and ignorance of international law on refugees by speaking as if all asylum seekers are refugees. How many more times does it have to be explained that an asylum seeker can either be an illegal immigrant or a refugee but cannot be both? This is not something I have made up; it has been common to international law for generations. I sometimes wonder why people continue to apply the phrase &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; to those who have been deemed to be illegal immigrants? This does <Col N="463" /> not make sense and it does not serve the Geneva Convention or the system well.</P>
    <P>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has made it clear on numerous occasions that it finds itself in a most difficult position when illegal immigrants clog up the system. If an illegal immigrant applies for asylum it must be clear that such an individual is abusing the asylum process. Abuse of the asylum process is undesirable for the following reason. The concept of sanctuary for an individual in a state is predicated on the person being in flight from persecution. If others who are not in flight from persecution seek to use and abuse this system it must be clear to everybody that it can only mean interminable delays for those who are in flight from persecution.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to accept that some people who come to this country to seek asylum are in need of the protection of this State and, in that context, Ireland has honoured, is honouring and will honour its international and humanitarian obligations. However, there is no doubt that some people who come here to seek asylum are not refugees. From our experience of processing claims, such people are in the majority and do not need the protection of the State. To that extent, they do not belong here but somewhere else.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Joe Higgins is not suggesting these people should be deported to some place they do not belong, because I have made it clear from the outset that such a step cannot be countenanced. For example, a person who makes an application for asylum in Britain, France or Germany belongs in one of those countries if he or she makes a second application in Ireland for the simple reason the Dublin Convention, which is part of international and Irish law, stipulates that such a person should proceed with an application in the State in which the first application was made. That is why such a person would belong in that member state and that has to be clear.</P>

It is also recognised by Trócaire and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace. However, it is not recognised by Deputy Joe Higgins, but that is a matter for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Socialist Party &ndash; I am being respectful to the Deputy and always will be <Col N="464" />&ndash; erected placards in Dublin stating that refugees are welcome here. I agree entirely and that is the law we operate. However, I do not agree with the party's placards which call for no deportations as that is a contraction in terms. If there are no deportations there cannot be any refugees. It would mean an illegal immigrant and a person fleeing persecution, in the lexicon of the Socialist Party, would be one. In those circumstances, since there would be no sanction or deportation against those who are not refugees, people who are refugees would have precisely the same status as those who are not refugees. This does not make sense.</P>
      <P>Deputy Joe Higgins said I betrayed contempt by my use of language. I have never done so, but I have noted a tendency in some quarters to misrepresent my language and my position to bolster an argument which is built on sand. I do not recall ever saying, for example, that 90% of refugees are bogus. I do not believe I ever said so and I invite Deputy Joe Higgins to indicate where and when I made such a comment.</P>
      <P>Neither I nor my officials, nor anyone acting on behalf of the Government, has entered negotiations with any representative of the Nigerian authorities with a view to bringing Nigerian police to Ireland. There have been negotiations with the Nigerian authorities regarding a re-admission agreement similar to that I signed with the Romanian Government. I would not be doing my duty if I did not address the issue of re-admission.</P>

      <P>We are working with the Nigerian authorities with a view to agreeing a re-admission agreement, as we are with Poland. I also intend to visit Britain and France in the not too distant future to see what assistance they can provide regarding immigration problems.</P>
      <P>What does Deputy Joe Higgins want? It appears he wants me to open the borders of this country and allow in every individual, irrespective of from where he or she comes or of his or her status in international law. While that would be an achievable ideal in Utopia, it is not an achievable ideal, nor is it even an ideal, in the Ireland of today. Such a policy would be unfair on the people of this country and on those coming into the country, and the system could not cope. With the greatest respect, it is not a realistic position to hold and I strongly disagree this is a bad day's work. I am only trying to introduce procedures to ensure the law of the land is respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I already rejected Deputy Jim Higgins's allegation to the effect that this is undemocratic, unfair and disgraceful as these proposals are before the House in accordance with Standing Orders. The Deputy spoke of major problems. There are and have been problems concerning the number of people seeking asylum and the number of staff dealing with applications. It is a matter of historical record that when I came to <Col N="465" /> office 22 staff were dealing with thousands of applications and most people did not know if their application would ever be heard.</P>

      <P>The number of staff is increasing and we are quickly getting to the stage where applications will be dealt with as expeditiously as, and even more expeditiously than, in other states. Deputy Jim Higgins rightly said that asylum seekers are not allowed to work, a policy with which he disagrees. A recent opinion poll appeared to suggest that 75% of people agree with the Deputy. However, I strongly hold the view that the introduction of a concession on the right to work would result in a major increase in the number of applicants coming into the State.</P>
      <P>The system is doing its best to cope. However, if the numbers were to increase appreciably, which would result from a concession on the right to work, I have no doubt the system would be put under such strain it might not be able to cope in the future. I am not trying to be impractical, I am trying to be as practical and honest as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins also raised the case of an individual who is the subject of a deportation order having to report to &ldquo;his executioner&rdquo;. That is emotive language but it is not true. The deportation process is predicated upon all the systems having been gone through and due process having been observed. Each individual's application is considered at first instance, it is considered on appeal and, if the individual wishes, he or she can make an application to the Minister of the day to seek to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds. When all of the processes have been gone through, an individual is served with a deportation order. There is no question of anyone being detained provided the individual complies with the order, but after all of the processes have been gone through, if an individual refuses to comply with the law of the land, I ask Deputy Jim Higgins what are we to do? There is no alternative but to deport the individual concerned. Once an individual has failed to comply with the law of the land, detention becomes necessary. I accept that is not <Col N="466" /> a pleasant picture to paint but, nonetheless, it is true.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins asked how will we know if a person will go unlawfully to another state. If a Romanian person who has been refused asylum here was found walking up the gangway of a ship headed for Holyhead, it would be fairly apparent he was not heading to Romania. There is an obligation to protect the common travel area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins said that sending a registered letter and assuming after three days it has been served is an unsafe way to proceed. Legal documents are served by registered post every day and the presumption of service is accepted. It is not as if the letters are sent by carrier pigeon. A letter is being sent by registered post, a person signs for it and therefore we must assume such a letter has arrived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I will not misquote Deputy Howlin, he said he recognised the necessity for deportations. However, all his amendments seem to suggest the opposite. If I were to implement the amendments tabled by him, the deportation process would become inoperable. I stress that deportation orders are the culmination, not the origin, of a process. Deputy Howlin referred to the rights of unsuccessful asylum seekers. I asked if he could enumerate those rights but he would not give way. That is why I would not give way to him.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the rights of unsuccessful asylum seekers is that they have a right to make an application to the Minister of the day for the right to stay on humanitarian grounds. They have the right to go to the High Court by way of <i>habeas corpus. </i> They have the right to seek judicial review to see if the procedures were applied properly throughout their case. All these rights are extraneous to and above and beyond the earlier procedures of due process where there is a substantive hearing and an appeal hearing and where translation facilities and legal aid are available. Nothing could be fairer than that. I cannot see how anything could be fairer than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish people who recognise the need for deportations would not seek to emasculate the process by putting forward amendments which <Col N="470" /> undermine the reality which they say they recognise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I genuinely tried to approach these matters with some level of co-operation to try to build consensus in this House. It is difficult when the Minister deals with them in the way he has done by publishing amendments on the eve of a debate and adopting a belligerent tone on every amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister made great play of the requirement to comply with our international obligations and applying the highest human rights standards. He is no doubt aware of the content of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing in a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. I contend the Minister has failed in that responsibility because some people whose entitlement and status has yet to be determined are here four years. He is in breach of his obligations to ensure a fair and public hearing in a reasonable time. His much vaunted regard and respect for our international obligations are threadbare. He will be familiar with Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states: &ldquo;The enjoyment of rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of amendment No. 25, once a deportation order is served on an individual, the power will be vested in that garda or immigration officer to take that person into custody forthwith if he has suspicions as outlined in the Act. If that power was to be put in place for any other breach of an Act there would be a significant outcry. There is discrimination in regard to how the law will apply to those who are determined to be subject to deportation orders and other citizens. I am surprised and disappointed the Minister did not take more care in looking at my amendments. While I did not expect they would all be accepted I thought he might find some merit in the arguments put forward about putting a time limit on the period in which an individual who is subject to a deportation order can be incarcerated.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that under section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, the aggregate time a person can be held is eight weeks. To avoid confusion will the Minister confirm that that eight weeks aggregate applies to detentions under the amendment proposed, that it fits into section 3 of the 1999 Act and the aggregate time refers to section 5 of the 1999 Act? I presume the aggregate time limit, because there is some confusion even among those who are advising and trying to read it, applies to that proposal. That one can be detained for eight weeks pending deportation is wrong. That somebody can be taken into custody on suspicion that he or she will not comply with a deportation order is wrong. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the timeframe in the 1999 Act and whether it will hold sway in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> The Minister's proposed amendment introduces Garda powers for the detention of unsuccessful asylum seekers &ndash; the Minister prefers to classify them as illegal emigrants. That is the phraseology he chooses. Under the earlier Act a Garda had to show a reasonable suspicion that a person had not complied with a deportation order. The new amendment suggests the Garda may detain an individual whom it suspects will in the future avoid removal from the State. That is a big jump. It gives the garda or immigration officer, who forms the view that somebody will not comply with the terms of a deportation order, the power to detain a person at a whim. I genuinely think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>A reading of the amendment suggests that any unsuccessful asylum seeker, the subject of a deportation order, can have the deportation order and a detention order served on him at the same time, without warrant, or the opportunity to appear before any judicial authority. They may then be detained until such time as they are deported out of the State or for an aggregate of eight weeks. There we have it <i>simpliciter. </i>The Minister said this is the normal corpus of law that exists throughout the rest of the European Union. Is there a power in other EU states to bring persons into custody as soon as a deportation order is issued, when they come to the end of the process? It is not the end of the process, as the Minister has rightly said. He pointed out that there are other processes, whether it is an application for judicial review, an application to the High Court for <i>habeas corpus</i> or an appeal to the clemency of the Minister on humanitarian grounds. How is somebody supposed to do all these in custody? What instruments and supports will be available to a person in custody to vindicate those rights?</P>
    <P>What has the Minister in mind and how will it happen? Where are people to be detained? Is it his intention once he begins to sign this raft of deportation orders that they will be detained in our new remand prison or in local Garda stations? In communities such as mine, if he follows through on deportation orders, there is precious little room in Garda stations to meet that requirement. Where will they be detained? Has he calculated how many gardaí will be involved in the process and the logistics of finding and incarcerating those people and processing all the deportation orders that will be signed in the comings weeks and months when this measure is enacted? I would like to hear the specifics of the measure because we have talked about the principle of it. Has it been thought out? How many gardaí will be allocated to this duty? Will it be co-ordinated centrally? Will there be a designated officer to co-ordinate it, and of what rank? Where will they be placed? What rights will they have to legal advice? Who will provide that legal advice? Will it be provided across the country? These technical matters are extremely important. They <Col N="472" /> are far more than technical because they weigh on human rights.</P>
    <P>Language, as the Minister acknowledges because he is a man who has a great regard for language, is very important in these matters. Talking in terms of bogus asylum seekers or&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ascribing those words to the Minister. I am saying they are in common usage. I saw them as headlines in newspapers. Everybody who comes to this country and claims asylum is unfortunate. Many of them do not comply with the requirements for asylum status and will not, under the laws of this State, be allowed to stay here. However, very few are blackguards. I have talked to scores of them in my clinics and have worked with them directly in my constituency. I spoke to very honourable people. I had an individual in my clinic in Wexford a couple of weeks ago who, in the context of a newspaper headline about thievery among a particular ethnic group, said to me that he wanted to be a model citizen. Because of the nature of the country from which he came, he will probably not be allowed to stay here, but if he were allowed to stay here he would add immeasurably to the wealth of the country because he was a grafter who wanted to work and to contribute. We need a parallel process to be put in place for economic migrants to have some other recourse. Perhaps the Minister's promised immigration Act will allow for that.</P>
      <P>All these good people who will be deported do not deserve to be vilified. Most of them are unfortunate. I can see them in my mind's eye because I talk to them. One individual who came to see me said he would be deported back to a place in Romania but that there is nothing there for him, that he could not live on the wages there, and that he will come back if he is deported because there is no life for him otherwise. That is an unfortunate case.</P>
      <P>When the people know these cases on an individual basis, it will not be an easy job for the Minister or for the agents of the State to carry out these deportations. Valid and all as they will be under the law, they will each be heart-rending and difficult, and no bullishness from anybody is merited when talking about this entirely unfortunate area.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I refute the Minister's allegation that Deputy Howlin and I are seeking to emasculate the Bill. This Minister has two Bills to his credit in relation to asylum issues. The first is the Immigration Bill, 1999. The second is the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill. Both were published and promulgated by the Minister, and both were emasculated by him and by him alone. The first Bill was substantially changed to inject into it unimplemented sections of the Refugee Act, 1996. In regard to this Bill we had assumed that we had seen the finished text, having dealt with it on Committee Stage in March. Yesterday <Col N="473" /> we were given another set of amendments, without notification, dialogue, or discussion between Department officials and Deputies Howlin, Joe Higgins and myself in order to arrive at some kind of agreement, with the result that we are having this debate today. The situation is entirely of the Minister's making. The Minister is the only person who is seeking to emasculate the Bill. We are seeking to improve it.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that these refinements, as he calls them, are necessary because of difficulties with the deportation procedures. He told the House today that there have been 1,218 notifications of deportation orders. Deputy Howlin and I believe the legislation we enacted prior to this and that we debated at length was adequate and sufficient and that the Minister, in introducing these Draconian measures, is going too far. The Minister makes the point that of the 1,218 notifications for deportation, there was a problem in relation to 715. Of the number invited to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made, 715, or 60%, did not make any representations. In about half of those cases the letter was not delivered or not received. In other words, there was no one at the last known address.</P>
      <P>How many of these people, so far as the Minister can determine, have voluntarily left the State, having decided to go rather than be subjected to the indignity of being taken, body and bones and by the scruff of the neck and forcibly put on a boat or plane out of the country? How many of the 715 are still here? How many of these people, who are the subject of deportation orders, are covered by Dublin Convention countries? How many are people who have a right to asylum and refugee status but are in the wrong country? These statistics are very important because if we are to introduce additional strictures here in procedures for deportation, we need to know the breakdown of the different categories and where are people who are the subject of deportation orders.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin that what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. As soon as this is enacted, we will be into an era of mass deportation. I fully agree with the importance of determining what kind of accommodation we are talking about. These immigrants are not common criminals. They are people who came, in many cases, from alien environments where the social and economic circumstances, apart altogether from humanitarian considerations, were not to their liking or where their safety was genuinely impaired. The vast majority are good upstanding people. Many have adequate qualifications which would considerably enhance this economy, but they are in the wrong channel, because we still do not have an immigration policy, despite the fact that we have had two separate press conferences, by this Minister and by the Tánaiste, one talking about an asylum policy and the other talking about an immigration policy which we have not yet seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> These immigrants are people who, if they applied for visas to work here, would be given them because they have the necessary skills to fill the skills vacuum that we have. These people are not common criminals, and they will now be put in jail pending deportation. They came here and threw themselves upon the mercy of the Government and of the people, just as so many thousands of young Irish people, in the past decade alone, went to the United States and threw themselves upon the mercy of the American people and Government. However, in the vast majority of cases, even though technically they were illegal in the context of United States immigration policy, they were not subjected to a punitive regime such as we are implementing here. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the debate on this issue. I appreciate the Minister's attempt to put in place fair and appropriate procedures in relation to asylum applications. As regards the deportation orders made to date, has the Minister any information on issues that have been brought to his or his Department's attention concerning illegal immigrants who have gone through due process and, a deportation order having been made, fail to meet that order? Will he indicate how much time is given to this, the arrangements made and so on? Do I understand that a number of people who applied and failed to get refugee status now claim right of residency and so on? </P>
      <P>There is benefit to be gained for the country from those who are genuine refugees but I differ from Deputy Higgins when he compares this to Irish people going to America in years gone by. There is a huge difference and no like comparison.</P>

The Minister put on record that it is known there is official trafficking in people and he related that to the years of slavery. If we remove all that from the system surely it will be in the best interests of all of us who are concerned with ensuring we have an efficient policy and fair, speedy and due process for those who deserve it. As regards those who may have an application in another country but decide to come here and see what they can apply for and who are intent on abusing or mis-using the system, it is right that there be a clear deportation mechanism in place and that they be deported <Col N="475" /> accordingly.

        <b>:</b> The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that 90% of asylum seekers in this country were bogus. The Minister of State repeated that some time later. The Minister intends to give draconian power to the Garda that, at any stage, someone served with a deportation order can be taken into custody. In reality what he is doing, and he raised it again now, is going on an alarmist binge about the hordes who are waiting in the shadows to invade this fair island of Ireland only for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who stands in their way with the resolute measures he has taken. What nonsense. What a basis on which to predicate legislation. In case anyone forgets, we are talking somewhere in the region of between 12,000 and 14,000 people who are seeking to right to remain in this country. This is described by certain Fianna Fáil Deputies as a crisis. It is incredible. The Episcopal Commission on Emigration, in a very interesting and good report last year, calculated that between 1.2 and 1.3 million Irish born people were residing in countries outside of this island, and 14,000 souls looking for a place to rest is a crisis. It is pathetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more people, going from Miltown to Cahirciveen, in a few States in the US than there are in this State looking for refuge and the right to remain here. It is a pity Deputy Callely did not continue on because the reality is that the Minister and certain right wing Deputies want to interpret the concept of asylum seekers in the narrowest possible fashion quite deliberately. The question that will be asked increasingly over the next years as we come to grips with the reality that the world is changing rapidly with regard to <Col N="476" /> the movement of people is, is there such a massive chasm between economic deprivation or the persecution deriving from it and poverty and hardship and persecution deriving from a democratic deficit in certain countries. What drove millions of Irish people abroad? Was it economic deprivation, political persecution or a combination of both? At different times it was all of those reasons. What is the difference between the 100,000 plus Irish youths who finished up in the streets of New York and Boston in the 1980s, fleeing mass unemployment, poverty and no future in this State, and the several thousand people who are seeking refuge in the State?</P>

        <b>:</b> Perhaps we are hearing something Deputy Callely has not come out with so far. Perhaps he thinks there is another agenda behind sending these 14,000 people to our shores. Is he hinting there is something underhand going on? I do not know if the Minister did so, but in the 1980s many of his colleagues sent representations to Washington and jetted back and forth across the Atlantic to beg for more than 100,000 of our youths to be given the right to remain in the United States, a right I fully support.</P>

        <b>:</b> Even by Deputy Callely's standards of judgment, the similarities are so clear as to be absolutely undeniable. Of course, Fianna Fáil must try to deny this because of the different ways it has approached the various groups. On the one hand, it begs the American Administration to give legal status to our youth &ndash; which was correct, they should have been given legal status &ndash; and, on the other, it comes into the Dáil to give police powers to ensure people who need refuge cannot escape the net.</P>
      <P>Let us hear what the difference is. I hope Fianna Fáil will not take the despicable line of reasoning &ndash; not that one could call it reasoning &ndash; of a colleague of the Minister's in South Kerry, Deputy Healy-Rae, who said the Irish abroad worked for everything they got, while completely ignoring the fact that those seeking asylum here are refused the right to work. That is a specious argument. I have no doubt Fianna Fáil people feel guilty about what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a few weeks ago, I was at the same location as the Minister in Ionad an Bhlascaod <Col N="477" /> Mhór, Dún Chaoin, when he opened a weekend organised by Fondúireacht an Bhlascaod. One of the events there was the launch of a book entitled <i>Hungry for Home</i>. I hope the Minister has a copy. I recommend that both he and Deputy Callely read that interesting book which traces the history of the Ó Cearnaigh family from the Blasket Islands. It traces the circumstances that gave rise to their emigration to Springfield, Massachusetts, and their subsequent life there. The author paints an interesting picture of an American city, a large area of which, nicknamed &ldquo;Hungry Hill&rdquo;, was settled entirely by thousands of Kerry people from Anascaul to the Blasket Islands and from Cahirciveen and other parts of south Kerry. On certain streets of that city Irish was a spoken language in the 1930s and 1940s.</P>
    <P>It is pathetic that public representatives from areas with a history of people who had to flee to find new lives abroad should adopt a mean-minded exclusivist attitude towards a few thousand refugees. The only difference between the Irish youths who emigrated in the 1980s and those people who have come here is the colour of their skin and, in many cases, a different racial basis. I am afraid that is what it comes down to; a racial policy is being implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wrong to categorise people as either asylum seekers or illegal immigrants. People who seek asylum do so because they need refuge from what they are fleeing. That there is an appeals mechanism is an acknowledgement, even by this State and the Government, that wrong decisions can be made. That decisions have been reversed on appeal shows that wrong decisions have been made. This allows for the possibility that further wrong decisions can be made on appeal, which should be rectified.</P>
    <P>The only answer the Minister has is to boot people out of the country. Does he understand what his mass deportation policy will mean in reality? People who have been in Dublin for several years have sought refuge in this country. Their children are attending school and speak with Irish accents. They are integrated into the community. The Minister has in his files many letters from their Irish neighbours asking the Minister to allow them to stay. If the Minister thinks he can implement a policy of mass deportation in the quiet of the night, by granting some of these new powers, he is seriously mistaken.</P>

        <b>:</b> What happened to the Costinas family, Deputy Callely? There was a pre-dawn raid. That is what happened and it was a disgraceful episode. Yahoos &ndash; some of them from the Minister's constituency &ndash; have stirred up hatred, although I cannot hold the Minister responsible for their actions. The Minister should have slapped them down but I did not hear such a public statement from him criticising the political <Col N="478" /> cavemen and the incitement to hatred that came from certain elements there.</P>
      <P>Many Irish citizens will strongly object to the heartless implementation of mass deportations of families, particularly those who have been here for a period of time. They will support the right of those people to remain here and continue the new lives they have made. They are an addition to this society.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that one of the most popular come-all-ye songs which was sung throughout the country, but particularly popular in Kerry &ndash; the Minister may have attended some singsongs where it was spun out &ndash; went as follows: &ldquo;The crops are all in and the peaches are gathered . all they will call you will be deportees&rdquo;. It was a song called Deportees which tells the sad and tragic tale of migrants from Mexico fleeing poverty and persecution in that country and being shunted back across the border after their labours had been used in the Californian lettuce and fruit fields, only to return illegally to be used by the same people in the same cynical way. It is ironic that a country which, by the popularity of that song, sympathised and empathised with people who are strangers in a foreign land seeking a home and shelter should now seek to implement policies to have the same effect as the subject of that song.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about hordes of people. The Minister talked about open borders and all the rest of it, but nobody will take that seriously. We are talking about a maximum of 14,000 people or less than that in the sense that many people have already moved on. The Minister would be much better bringing in regulations to allow those people to fit into society and take up the jobs that are being advertised left, right and centre. The small and medium enterprises organisation appeared before the committee chaired by Deputy Callely yesterday and cried out for 65,000 workers. There are thousands of people who want to work yet the Minister is wasting the time of the Dáil to have them forcibly deported. It is absolutely incredible.</P>

      <P>Eight weeks, but Deputy Howlin will be aware that I have, for example, entered into a re-admission agreement with Romania and the intention is that people would be brought back to Romania by plane and that humane arrangements would be made in order to ensure people are accommodated on a plane, treated with dignity, as befits their status as human beings, and returned home because of the fact that they are not legally in this jurisdiction following on due process. There is nothing wrong with that. That is the position in every other country. Obviously, the objective of the exercise would be to ensure that detention of any such person will be for the minimum period possible. I can assure the House of that. I have no intention, nor does the Government, of simply picking up people to detain them for the maximum period of time. That would be a rather futile and crazy exercise. The objective of the exercise will be to try to ensure that people are brought back to their home countries as quickly as possible.</P>

I want to stress that it is open to any person who is detained for the purposes of deportation to agree to leave the State immediately. Arrangements can be made for that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;with the detention orders. The deportation process is for people who, having been through due process, will not obey the law of the land. The central question is, if people will not obey the law of the land, what <Col N="480" /> am I supposed to do? If I will not enforce the law of the land, will the Deputy tell me who will?</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of gardaí and the structures, I have already announced that the Government approved my proposal for the establishment of a new national immigration bureau, which will be headed by a detective chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána, and significant additional resources are being allocated to that bureau, including a detective superintendent, two detective inspectors and a significant number of additional detective sergeants and detective gardaí. The detective garda chief superintendent will consequently have direct control of 37 Garda personnel and, in addition to that, he will have indirect responsibility for members who are allocated full-time to immigration duties at points of entry as well as persons who are allocated to immigration duties as the need arises. The bureau will, of course, absorb the existing immigration registration office.</P>
      <P>The bureau will have national functions in relation to the monitoring and tracking of non-nationals who are the subject of deportation orders. The effective co-ordination of activities leading to the execution of deportation orders; the effective co-ordination of operational strategies and resources from points of entry into the State &ndash; the airports, ports and Border crossings; co-ordination and direction of strategies to combat trafficking in illegal immigrants; the strengthening of international liaison arrangements on relevant immigration issue, including liaison with Garda officers based abroad; the provision of a non-national registration service and the enforcement of immigration law generally.</P>
      <P>The leadership of the bureau at detective chief superintendent level will facilitate full co-ordination of Garda activities including point of entry controls, the monitoring of non-nationals and the effective execution of the deportation process. It will also facilitate the deployment of additional Garda resources to critical areas or at critical times as the need arises.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of people in detention for the purposes of deportation, there are well enshrined processes for obtaining legal assistance on demand. The 1987 custody regulations in relation to Garda stations are an example of that.</P>

      <P>Yes. Accordingly, there is ample opportunity after detention to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court to initiate <i>habeas corpus </i>proceedings or an application for judicial review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little point in providing an alternative process which would only serve to impose an unnecessary procedural hindrance. Legal aid will be available to people. I <Col N="481" /> have always indicated that that was the position. It is perfectly fair. I agree with Deputy Howlin that, in the main, the people who come here are unfortunate. I am not denying that for one moment. Immigration law is a tough business and nobody relishes deporting human beings. I do not think any minister for justice or the interior across Europe or anywhere else relishes it and neither do I. However, I have to enforce the law. If the law is not enforced there is no respect for it, the consequences of which I outlined earlier. I also completely accept and agree that the people concerned do not deserve to be vilified. I agree this should not be the case and, as I have stated on a number of occasions in the past, this is not an easy business.</P>
      <P>However, irrespective of the quality of the individuals concerned, it comes down to whether an individual is a refugee or an illegal immigrant in terms of immigration law. A person who is an illegal immigrant has to leave the State. That is what happens in every other jurisdiction of which I am aware. That is the absolute truth. Deputy Howlin wondered if other jurisdictions had the same detention powers. As far as I am aware, there is detention before the deportation order in some jurisdictions. Ireland's regime is by no means the toughest in Europe, and certainly not the toughest in the world. However, it is, unfortunately, necessary at this point to amend immigration law to effect the deportation process.</P>
      <P>The present position is that an individual has to be written to and told the date, time and place of his or her deportation. It will not come as a surprise to anybody that most people do not accept that invitation. In those circumstances, it must be apparent that the law has to be amended. In reply to Deputy Howlin, it will be co-ordinated centrally by the bureau which I mentioned. I do not believe there is, to quote the Deputy, a &ldquo;big jump&rdquo;, but that this is just a pragmatic, practical step which is being taken to ensure the law is respected and enforced.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Jim Higgins that this is a draconian measure. As far as I recall, Draco was a lawyer. To disobey his laws led to immediate execution. Nobody was executed &ndash; all I am doing is enforcing the law by arranging for the deportation process to be streamlined so that the law can be enforced by the Garda authorities. Dramatic language to the effect that this is a draconian measure is not merited, when this is merely a measure equivalent to other measures in civilised jurisdictions across the world.</P>
      <P>Questions on how many have left the State, how many are still here and how many are covered by Dublin Convention countries are very difficult to answer. It is not possible, at this remove, to give Deputy Higgins a precise answer on how many are in any of those categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could speculate that a proportion of those who have fallen out of the system at the various stages along the way may have already left for unknown destinations. About 3,000 asylum appli<Col N="482" /> cants have abandoned their applications and are no longer in the social welfare system. It is possible that some of those who have not availed, for example, of the invitation to make representations on why they should not be deported, or who have failed to comply with the requirements of a deportation order when made, may have assumed fresh identities and reapplied for asylum or are otherwise still in the State and making a living here by working illegally. These factors may all be the case. It is very difficult, at this remove to be specific in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins rightly pointed out that people who turn out to be illegal immigrants are in the wrong channel. If people want to work here, there is a legal channel through which they can, by making an application to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Many thousands of such applications are received every year and, for the most part, are rubber stamped by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is open to any person to make an application to work legally in the State. That is the way I wish people would proceed.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of no moment to me, where people come from or their ethnic background, race, colour or creed. What is of importance is that people who wish to work in this State and who are not refugees come here legally. I reject any insinuation by Deputy Joe Higgins, which I will come to later, that I would be less than fair in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely asked us to address the issue of the number of illegal immigrants who have remained in the State after deportation orders have been made and asked if people are failing to turn up. As I explained, it will come as no surprise that most people do not accept the invitation to be deported, which is why I have had to bring proposals before the House today to change the system. In all, I have made 396 orders so far. In 198 of those cases arrangements were made. There were 30 supervised departures, seven left before deportation, there are 60 judicial reviews, ten are being revoked on the advice of the Attorney General, 49 have experienced technical difficulties, 32 are being arranged, 91 did not turn up at all and 117 are not at their last known addresses. That is the system we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it is not a valid comparison. The truth is one cannot make a comparison between a small island nation on the periphery of Europe which is subject to the vagaries of economic fluctuations and the economic powerhouse of the world, no more than one can make the argument that the geographic size of this country can be compared with the large mass that is the United States of America. That is not a valid comparison. In any event, I have indicated, as has the Tánaiste, that there is no difficulty with people making an application to come to this State to work legally. It is something which, in respect of the many disciplines in the country at present, I would be prepared to actively encourage. However, what cannot be countenanced is the abuse of the asylum process by people who turn out to be illegal immigrants. The abuse of the asylum process is to the detriment of people who are refugees and also the State which is requested to take such people on the basis that they are refugees when they are illegal immigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept for one moment and I reject contemptuously any allegation by Deputy Higgins or anybody else, inside or outside this House, <Col N="485" /> who would seek to suggest that I am not evenhanded or fair in my dealings in this respect or any other. It is entirely wrong, unfair and black propaganda of the worst kind to suggest that I would discriminate against any human being on the basis of his race, colour, ethnic origin, creed, political beliefs or any other reason. I remind the House that my function here is to ensure that the law of this land under the Constitution is enforced. I make no apology for that. It will be enforced in a balanced, fair and reasonable way, but enforced it must be. There is no other alternative to that.</P>
    <P>I hear cries of &ldquo;There is no policy&rdquo;. Deputies Howlin and Higgins have recently said that policy is in a state of collapse and does not exist. What is really wrong is that people are actually saying, &ldquo;I do not like the policy&rdquo;. Not liking the policy does not mean there is none. There is and has been a consistent policy, which I have spelled out on numerous occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making it up as he goes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>If someone is a refugee within the meaning of the convention, he will get sanctuary in this State. If someone is not a refugee but an illegal immigrant, he must leave this State. Deputy Higgins says this problem is being exaggerated and that there are perhaps at most 14,000 asylum seekers in the State. My understanding is that there are in the region of 12,000 asylum seekers in the State at present. The difficulty is that there are in the region of 60,000 applicants in the United Kingdom every year and there is a common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom. There is a large number of applicants &ndash; running into many thousands &ndash; in France and the same applies in Germany. This is a feature of all member states of the European Union.</P>
      <P>If I relax the rules in the manner suggested by Deputy Higgins and others and act on the basis that I am not living in the real world but in some kind of Utopia, the result would be a grossly disproportionate number of illegal immigrants in the State within a very short period. That is not something I am making up or dreamed about last night, it is something I know about, have read about and have studied over a long period of time. People may not agree with what I am doing and they have the right to object to it. I respect diversity and every man's right to have an opinion. However, I ask, for one final time, please do not misrepresent the position for cheap political advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin where the Minister concluded, with an appeal not to misrepresent anybody's position for cheap political advantage. On two consecutive weekends, I have read the propaganda machine of the Minister misrepresenting my party's position and that of the Opposition, consistently and deliberately. I have <Col N="486" /> already pointed out the truth of the position to the Minister and I hope he will heed his admonition and desist from issuing soundbites.</P>
      <P>It is about time the Minister stopped peddling the untruth about the greenfield site he inherited. He inherited a situation where there was a tiny fraction of the asylum seekers who are currently in the country. The figures are there &ndash; 85% of the asylum seekers currently here arrived on the Minister's watch. He cannot deny that, the figures are there. I will read them into the record again if that is what the Minister wants but he knows that to be the truth. He also knows that the previous Administration, which was in office for two and a half years, less than the Minister's three years, enacted the Refugee Act. It was not the fault of that Administration that the Act was not implemented in its term of office because it was challenged by the High Court.</P>
      <P>What was said of this Act? An article on the sliding scales of justice in Refugees and Asylum Seekers &ndash; A Challenge to Solidarity, a joint policy document of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and Trócaire, stated that the Refugee Act, 1996, &ldquo;is noteworthy and some of its sections distinguish it as one of the most progressive models of refugee legislation in Europe&rdquo;. That was the green field the Minister had, a perfectly good model designed for the needs of the time. He sat on his hands for the bulk of his three years in office and allowed the situation to get progressively worse. He allowed peculiar elements of this society to whip up public agitation and concern, as a consequence of which we have heard the most despicable xenophobic and racist comments. All that falls on his head and history will judge him harshly for his inaction in this regard. No amount of restating his fictional view of the record of the previous Administration will salve his conscience in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister's other point relates to the Irish illegals of the 1980s. That is not ancient history &ndash; it is not the 17th or 18th centuries. It is estimated in a document from the United States Embassy in Dublin that between 1987 and 1997 75,000 Irish people were given visas under the lottery programme. We appealed for those lottery programmes to enable undocumented people to stay in the United States. We were all involved in those appeals. I had plenty of letters in my postbag at the time from undocumented Irish people in America who were desperately anxious. We all made representations for those visas. What was the difference with those Irish people, from our constituencies, seeking an economic future for themselves? I am not saying it is quite analogous to seeking refugee status, but it should make us more compassionate and understanding than is indicated by some of the Minister's rhetoric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is also wrong to exude this fortress Europe mentality. We have 12,000 asylum seekers here and we are not sure how many of them will meet the criteria laid down by law to enable them to be granted asylum status and to become residents of the State. It is wrong to look <Col N="487" /> at Britain or France, as the Minister suggests. There is a suggestion that a huge mass of people is coming towards developed Europe and we must man our barricades lest they arrive here. Earlier today the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights met a delegation from the defence and security committee of the Czech Republic which told us that there are 250,000 illegals in that country and that a further 250,000 legalised non-Czech nationals who have been given permission to stay there. That is the attitude of an applicant country which is considerably poorer than Ireland &ndash; it has absorbed some portion of those people into its society.</P>
    <P>That is a European country, but what about the bulk of refugees in the world? The bulk of refugees are not in France or Britain. I quoted earlier from the document, Refugees and Asylum Seekers: A Challenge to Solidarity. On page 6 it states:</P>
    <P>. the disproportionately high contribution of the least developed countries and of sub-Saharan Africa as host countries, where refugee numbers represent 0.9 to 1% of the resident population is even more striking. Relative to population, these particularly impoverished countries do three times as much for refugees as the industrialised countries, despite having a much smaller absorbative capacity. Their average income per head is only one third to one half even of those of the developing countries as a whole . The situation for some individual countries is even more stark. Malawi, Burundi and Rwanda have hosted refugee populations equivalent to 7%, 4.5% and 3.9% of their populations respectively. [Malawi, Burundi and Rwanda are some of the poorest countries on earth.] Tanzania, a priority Irish aid country with an average income per person of little more than 4% of Ireland's, hosts a refugee population equivalent to 2% of its own population. Relative to population, this is 20 times the contribution currently made by Ireland.</P>
    <P>That dispels the myth that there is a mass of humanity ready to march on fortress Europe. Refugees and the movement of population is an international phenomenon and it is a burden being carried disproportionately by the poorest of the poor already. We are being asked to carry our measure and the Minister's comments sit poorly in that regard.</P>
    <P>In a way, however, that brings us away from the net issue, which is that we believe these amendments go too far. I ask the Minister to reflect again on this and to modify the detention powers he is giving the gardaí in these matters. It is clear that this policy is not thought out, as by the Minister's own admission he does not know and cannot tell the House where detainees are to be detained. He does not know or, if he does know, he has not told this House. Frankly, he has no right to propose detention until this has been <Col N="488" /> thought out and he knows where people are to be detained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins is right. The Irish people are civilised, compassionate and caring. If the Minister starts detaining families and children in Garda stations, remand prisons or secure units there will be a public outcry and many Opposition Members will be involved in that. Where will the Minister detain these women and children who do not meet the requirements of Irish law in relation to asylum status. Where will he put them? We have a right to know that before he pushes this measure through the House.</P>

The Act, therefore, stayed in an unimplemented state from June 1996 through to the general election of 1997.

      <P>Well, 250,000 illegal immigrants. He also suggests there are 250,000 people who have been granted some legal status by the Government there. That represents approximately 5% of the entire population of that country. It must be remembered that the Czech Republic is located in the centre of Europe. A total of 80 million people transit that country each year. Eighty million people do not transit the Republic of Ireland each year.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the most salient matter in regard to the points raised by Deputy Howlin. He attempted to make a comparison between the number of visas granted in the United States of America to young Irish people with the number of legal status applications granted in the Czech Republic and the number of asylum seekers in the Republic of Ireland. That is not a valid comparison. I have outlined the reasons relating to the geography and economy of this country but there is another fundamental reason that it is not a valid comparison. As a proportion of the population of this small island, Ireland is now second from the top of the EU list in terms of the number of asylum seekers in the country.

        <b>:</b> The Minister has outlined many statistics and facts. He should have circulated them to the Deputies participating in this debate and allowed them to absorb and understand them. It is not fair of the Minister to blind us with facts and figures on the many aspects of this issue and to expect an informed discussion to ensue. We will have to trawl through the Official Record on the computer tonight or tomorrow to get those figures when they should be available for the discussion now.</P>
      <P>If I heard him correctly, the Minister said that 37 gardaí are to be diverted to a unit to deal with deportations. It will deal with the deportation of people drawn from a cohort of approximately 12,000. The figure is less than I suggested earlier, which simply makes the attitude being adopted more pathetic. By coincidence, that figure is almost the same as the number of heroin addicts in the State, most of whom live in Dublin. There are no accurate assessments of the number but people working in the field assess it at approximately 12,000.</P>
      <P>Is it not criminal that instead of the 37 gardaí being deployed to prevent the gangsters and drug barons, who have blighted neighbourhoods and destroyed working class communities, bringing their merchandise of death to the youth of this country, they will be sent on the highways and byways to chase a few thousand or, possibly, a few hundred unfortunate people who are to be deported by order of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Nothing could speak more loudly of the priorities of this Government. It is shameful beyond words and the Minister should be called to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the resources the Minister is now diverting, <Col N="492" /> which along with this cohort of gardaí encompass officials, civil servants, paper and time, were diverted in a positive direction towards ensuring that the people who are in this country can become involved in the life of this country and can work in and contribute to it, we would be a thousand times better off. It would be a good use of resources. However, using them in this way is shameful.</P>
    <P>The Minister tries to justify this untenable position and fortress Europe is invariably invoked. The Minister was invoking the spectre of those who have penetrated the fortress. God between us and all harm, they are already inside the fortress and might make an extra move in the direction of this fair country. It is pathetic for the Minister to attempt to make a lame argument in relation to the numbers of illegal Irish youths in the United States in the 1980s by referring to the size of the population of America. There were not just 120,000 Irish youths in the United States, there were hundreds of thousands from Mexico, other areas in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. Even though it is a big country, the numbers are absolutely incomparable with 12,000 souls looking for a place to call home, and the Minister turns them out of the stable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great responsibility in this regard. Can he guarantee that everyone who is sent back to his or her country of origin will have safety of life and limb? He had better answer that question. A colleague of his, Deputy O'Malley, stated in this House that people left planes at Shannon in the course of the last 30 years or so, sought refuge in this country, were not heard &ndash; this is true, there is a difference there &ndash; and were bundled unceremoniously back onto the planes. These may have been Russian planes at a time when Stalinism held sway there. When the Minister gets an opportunity he should take a history lesson on the difference between the monstrous totalitarian regime known as Stalinism and democratic socialism, particularly the tradition of democratic socialism as represented by people who believe in the genuine ideals of people like Marx, Engels, Rosa Luxembourg, Leon Trotsky and so on. Socialism is not Stalinism.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley said he had no doubt people were sent to their deaths from this island. It is absolutely shameful that a former Government Minister would say this about the record of this country in the past three decades or so. Will the Minister guarantee the safety of people detained at the whim of a garda?</P>
      <P>He raises the question of why people come here from Nigeria as if it is a major mystery and seems to be building a theory around this. It might be the fact that hundreds, if not thousands, of Irish priests and nuns went to Nigeria and other African countries over the past 90 years or more and perhaps spoke about the fair and welcoming country from which they came and the Christian values and welcome that was here for people who were poor and in need of refuge, succour and support. Perhaps they came to this country because they had a picture of a land where they could perhaps escape from some of the trauma, hardship, difficulties and suffering they had in their own country.</P>
      <P>Nigeria has an extremely repressive regime and it is disgraceful that the Minister should have any dealings with that regime which is corrupt at all levels. Nigeria is one of the most corrupt countries in Africa and it is shameful that the Minister should have any dealings with it in order to effect deportations.

        <b>: </b>Perhaps it was their introduction to the fact that the island of Ireland existed.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to batten down the hatches for fortress Europe. He should get real because, in the globalised economy in which we now operate, European companies and personnel, big major capitalist concerns, are operating in all the countries from which refugees are coming. They are making masses of money by exploiting the raw materials, resources and in some cases the labour of the countries from which people are seeking refuge here. It is not surprising that this is happening but we were totally unprepared for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> The Minister attacked Deputy Howlin for referring to the Czech Republic and the fact that millions of people pass through that country. Last year 1.3 million people visited the Minister's native county of Kerry from all over the world. Therefore, the fact that thousands of people wish to remain in this country is not a surprise.</P>
    <P>The State does not enforce the laws of this country equally. There are different laws for different categories of people. There is summary justice if one is poor. If one is alleged to be in breach of the law, one is summarily dealt with and may end up in jail. If one is a rich, a corrupt businessman for example, one will be dealt with in an entirely different fashion. A tribunal will be set up to deal with the matter and one's identity will be protected for years, as happened with the Ansbacher men. The Minister should examine what happens at the points of entry to the country in relation to the different categories of people. Will the Minister say that if a white American businessman obtains access to Ireland for a holiday he will be treated in exactly the same way as if he were a poor black person from Rwanda? One only needs to go to the points of entry to know that is not the case. The fact is that different categories of people are treated differently.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the Minister is spending an entire day in this House to bring in this repressive legislation for 12,000 people when these resources should be diverted to the real needs and problems of society. This certainly does not relate to a few thousand people seeking to live and work here.</P>

The amendments would not have been necessary if the Minister took the procedural options open to him. The Dublin Convention, an international agreement between EU member states which was signed in 1996 during our Presidency of the EU, should have diffused much of the situation about which the Minister has such paranoia, namely, the flood tide, influx or invasion of people who, according to the Minister, are not entitled to be here.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Dublin Convention is obviously not working. A few moments ago the Minister spoke about there being no direct flights to various parts of the world, particularly central Africa, and that these people are coming here through other EU countries. He says that as a result he must introduce this punitive measure and the attendant strictures and penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the Minister travels to Europe on a regular basis and liaises with his ministerial colleagues, why does he not work out a common EU immigration policy? If the Dublin Convention is not working and if we have been hoodwinked by our fellow EU partners, particularly the French, <Col N="495" /> why has the Minister not taken it up at EU level? If it is obvious the convention is not working and is being flouted by others, with people being assisted in getting onto lorries in order to come to Ireland and thereby contributing to what the Minister sees as a problem, why has the Minister not revisited the convention in an EU context? Does the Minister intend taking this matter up with his fellow EU Ministers in order to remind them of their obligations and to put in place another feasible option, given that the Dublin Convention is manifestly not working?</P>
    <P>With regard to today's deliberations, if the Minister had not taken up 70% of the time filibustering in response to the various points raised we might have concluded by now. Had the decent thing been done, as we requested, of discussing this in a committee we might have been able to resolve matters far more amicably.</P>
    <P>I fully subscribe to the contention by Deputies Joe Higgins and Howlin that to say there is no comparison between the US and here because the US has such absorption powers is not a valid contention. I make this point in the context of getting things in perspective. The Minister is again sounding the alarm bells, and we can imagine the headlines in tomorrow's newspapers which will report that we are now heading for pole position in the European league. We are talking about a paltry, measly 12,000 people. They could be corralled, as may be done if the Minister goes down the road of detention and custody, into the canal end of Croke Park. That is the extent of the influx or invasion.</P>
    <P>We are now talking about mass deportations. Deputy Howlin is correct in saying that before we can agree to further measures we must know what logistical, humanitarian and accommodation or detention centre arrangements will be put in place. If the Minister continues to contend that 90% of the people concerned are bogus, then 10,800 will be deported. The Minister said it is his view they should be shifted and shafted as quickly as possible. What will happen? Where will they be put? The prison system is already in chaos and Garda stations in this city are overcrowded on a nightly basis with homeless people. Yet the Minister is asking the House to adopt a new regime to detain people as soon as they are the subject of a deportation order. A garda who suspects a person will move away can automatically detain them for up to eight weeks. We are not talking about arranging documentation and other practical issues to facilitate them leaving the State. Rather it will involve three or four flights before they are delivered to the regime from which they fled.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago I had the pleasure of visiting Iowa and of addressing both houses of state on St. Patrick's Day. Before going I read a very salutary book called <i>Farewell to Famine</i> about the people of Wexford who went in great numbers to the US in anticipation of the Great <Col N="496" /> Famine. The title comes from an initiative by a local priest who had the foresight to foresee the Famine and who decided to make alternative arrangements for the people before it arrived. At the back of the chamber of the state house in Des Moines I saw the very Irish names of the various members 160 or 170 years later &ndash; Morrisey, Codd and Foley &ndash; all of Wexford and Irish origin. I recall this in light of Ireland effectively bringing down an iron curtain rather than embracing the right of 12,000 people to a dignified existence, a tiny paltry fraction of the number we need in order to sustain the economic growth of the Celtic tiger. Yet we cannot find it in our hearts to make provision for these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was faced with an impossible situation. As Deputy Howlin correctly pointed out, it was not a green-field situation. We tried to provide him with a green field situation when in March 1998 Fine Gael gave Private Members' time to Democratic Left to enable Deputy McManus table the Regularisation of Asylum Seekers Bill which provided for an amnesty for those who were in the country prior to 1 January 1998 and who had not had their asylum application processed. That would have given the Minister a green-field situation and would have enabled him get his house in order and start again. It would have allowed him make a fresh beginning and to ensure applications were dealt with in an orderly, structured and timely fashion, but the Minister refused to accept the Bill.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a thing about amnesties, but this was an attempt to bring into being an arrangement which would enable him to start afresh with all the applications after 1 January 1998. However, he turned it down as he has turned down all the reasonable initiatives we have put forward by way of amendment. As a result the perception among the public is that there is a marked absence of leadership on the issue. Consequently, we have xenophobia, about which Deputy Joe Higgins spoke, which is rampant in the Minister's constituency with nobody being brought to book. Racism, which we never suspected was latent, has been given full vent because we have no Government leadership in terms of getting a sensible perspective on the issue.</P>
    <P>By putting further measures in place we are sending out the clear message that Ireland is a no go area for asylum seekers. That is the clear intention of the legislation which is being delivered on an instalment, <i>ad hoc</i> basis on top of the other measures introduced by the Minister and his sound bites. We are in a very sorry state as regards our attempt to deal with an issue which is manageable and certainly within the competence of an organised regime to structure. All one has to do is marry the two issues.</P>

In addition, each of Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to acquire any additional shares for a period of 18 months from the completion of the offers, provided that KPN Telecom is not restricted from increasing its shareholding in the company to a level not exceeding 29.9 per cent&rdquo;;</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech has received a very easy ride in the press so far. When people have had time to study it, however, the <Col N="498" /> reaction may be considerably different. The Minister traded on a few facile, basic premises, one of which was that shares go up and shares go down and that she could not be held responsible for the vagaries of the market. She was right, but in this case we start from a fixed price, a price fixed, according to Mr. Alfie Kane, by the Minister after huge mind-boggling sums of money had been spent on advising her and others surrounding the flotation of Telecom Éircom. The result is that hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens who dabbled in shares for the first time have got their fingers burnt. It seems that these people were entitled to rely on the very expensive advice that the Minister received and on her own manifest enthusiasm for the flotation.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, drew attention to the amazing amount of money &ndash; £40 million &ndash; included in the original Book of Estimates for a panoply of advisers for advice surrounding the flotation. A Supplementary Estimate had to be introduced to provide for the payment of a further £40 million, giving a total of £80 million. In terms of this being a lesson for the future the question has to be raised as to whether advisers had a vested interest given that they were on a percentage for the second £40 million.</P>
      <P>What price was agreed by the Minister when the sum of £40 million was included in the original Book of Estimates? This sum could not have been provided for unless the Minister had a price in her head. We do not know what the figure is but it appears that the advisers had a vested interest in the revaluation of the original price&mdash;</P>

    <P>Mr. Alfie Kane has told us for the first time &ndash; this is news &ndash; that the company was overpriced by comparison with its peers by 30%. If there was a 30% premium would-be purchasers were not told. What did the man and woman in the street believe? They thought that they were investing their savings, for the first time in shares, in response to a mood of ecstasy generated by the Minister. The environment of hype, balloons and hoop la surrounding the flotation must be recalled. The people were bombarded with hard-sell advertising that cost the taxpayer a fortune. It was relentless, pervasive, seductive and calculated to persuade the unsuspecting punter that this was really a kind of government stock and that he or she could not go wrong, that he or she was on a safe bet. The atmosphere of champagne bubbles, giggly photo opportunities and mad dashes across the Atlantic attracted unprecedented interest from citizens who had not pre<Col N="499" /> viously purchased a share but they bought the message.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now falling back and pointing to the mini-prospectus which she claims made it clear that Comsource, KPN and Telia, were not long-term partners. This is disingenuous for two reasons and I am surprised that the media have not bothered to look behind or research it in reporting what happened here last night. The proposition that the small print of the mini-prospectus superseded the hype and hoop la led by the Minister is nonsense. Where is there a speech or press statement by a Minister or by anybody on behalf of the company drawing attention to the opaquely worded paragraph in the mini-prospectus quoted by the Minister? There is no such statement. The intended inference was the opposite.</P>
      <P>Is the most populist of all populist Ministers seriously arguing that the typical first-time share purchaser seized on the small print of the mini-prospectus rather than being dazzled by the colourful rhetoric of the Minister as she elbowed Alfie Kane out of the photograph? One could not seriously suggest this. The hundreds of thousands of first-time share purchasers who are not familiar with the ways of the Stock Exchange or mini or long prospectuses did not read the small detail, rather they depended on the mammy of the nation telling them that this was a safe bet. All she was short of doing was wheeling her wheelbarrow down Moore Street and selling shares off the back of the barrow. That was the approach adopted.</P>
      <P>The mini-prospectus is a reduced version of the long prospectus which states at page 62:</P>
      <P>In January 1999 the Governments of Sweden and Norway announced their intention to merge Telia and Telenor which had certain interests in telecom companies in Ireland which compete with us. If the merger is completed or if Telia believes that the conditions to the merger will be satisfied and that the merger will be consummated Telia has informed us that either it will dispose of its interest in us or Telenor's competing interests in Ireland will be disposed of to avoid conflicts of interest. We have agreed the principal terms under which Telia may withdraw from the strategic alliance and negotiated with KPN a new strategic co-operation agreement which will take effect if the withdrawal of Telia occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> That conveys the exact opposite to what the Minister sought to convey. The principals to the agreement were agreed that KPN would take up the Telia shares. The Minister conveyed the opposite. It should not be forgotten that KPN and Telia (Comcourse) were described in the prospectus as strategic partners. There is nothing temporary about strategic partners. They were there for the longer haul. During her speech last night, the Minister quoted the mini-prospectus which stated, &ldquo;In addition, each of Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to acquire any additional Shares for a period of 18 months from the completion of the Offers, provided KPN Telecom is not restricted from increasing its shareholding in the Company to a level not exceeding 29.9%&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The whole environment being created was that this was a permanent strategic alliance, they were in for the long haul and the terms of any take-up of Telia's shares by KPN were already agreed. The Minister flew around the world with poor little Alfie Kane hemmed in between her and Ray MacSharry portraying this as a Fianna Fáil give-away to the people of Ireland like it was giving out Smarties. However, it has all gone wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. McGrath):</NameTxt>
      <P>I call Deputy Michael Kitt. The Deputy is sharing time with Deputies N. O'Keeffe, O'Flynn, P. Carey, Power, C. Lenihan and McGuinness, in that order. The Deputies have five minutes each.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government amendment and find it difficult to understand why we are holding this debate which attacks the Government and the Minister. Eircom has been in private ownership for almost a year and has hundreds of thousands of shareholders drawn from every walk of life.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how anyone could give a commitment to the effect that the shares of a floated company would never drop in price. That could not happen in any country. No one would make such a commitment and the Minister did not do so at the time of the Eircom flotation. There are strict laws regarding companies on the Irish and international stock exchanges which would have prevented her from giving such a commitment, even if she wished to do so.</P>
      <P>There has been some controversy surrounding this issue and I would be concerned if the effect of that controversy is to apply downward pressure on the share price. I wish to comment on the prospectus issued on the Eircom flotation. That prospectus was the responsibility of the board and contained a chapter on risks which fairly set out the risks associated with investing in Eircom shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mini-prospectus referred to by the Minister noted that the value of the shares could be adversely affected. In particular, it referred to increasing competition in the fixed line services market and the entrance of a third mobile telephone operator which would increase compe<Col N="501" /> tition in the mobile communications services market.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many Eircom workers who are concerned the competition may not be operating on a level playing pitch, even though they welcome that competition. These workers point out that other telephone companies require information on applicants' bank accounts and credit worthiness, while Eircom is prepared to provide a full service without such information. The company is dependent on continuing its good relationship with its employees and their trade unions, and I compliment them on the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>The fall in the price of Eircom shares has left more than 500,000 Irish investors with losses of 20% on their original investments. However, the institutional offer was over-subscribed 16 times, even at the top of the price range. The Government received advice from Merrill Lynch to float the shares at £3.27 and Merrill Lynch is now advising Eircom. The launch price was lower than £3.27 at £3.07. After the flotation the share price rose by 20% and shares have traded well above the flotation price most of the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that the share price has been below the issue price on only 38 out of the 234 days since the launch. It is interesting that the Eircom chief executive officer held his peace for those 234 days. When the shares fell in price he stated they were over valued. However, we could have made some money if he told us that last year as modest investments, such as mine, could have been sold.</P>
    <P>The company had a strong balance sheet at the time of the flotation. The price set by the Government was on the basis of what the market was prepared to pay and on expert advice. The Government tried to balance the need for a fair price for taxpayers with a fair return for retail and institutional investors. The potential returns to Eircom investors have been available against the background of a market which has been sluggish, at best, or in decline since the flotation.</P>
    <P>Sentiment in stock markets has turned against European telecommunications stocks in recent months as high technology companies in general have suffered sharp declines in share price. The sums paid for the third generation mobile telephone licences in the UK massively surpassed initial expectations and companies such as British Telecom, Deutsche Telecom and France Telecom are off their share price highs in 2000.</P>
    <P>This motion is not about the fundamentals underlying the Eircom flotation. It has been tabled without regard for the interests of the company's shareholders and seeks to use present market conditions for cynical ends. I support the amendment and the Minister's handling of the flotation.</P>

      <P>The Opposition is crying wolf again. It has nothing else to debate but the affairs of a publicly listed company which is now in private ownership. All shares carry risks and <Col N="502" /> there are no guarantees. I am in business a long time but last year was the first time I purchased shares when I bought Eircom shares. No one forced me to buy the shares. I knew I was taking a risk. I read about the Wall Street crash and other stock market crashes, and I knew I could have sold the shares and made a profit of 23% when they reached £3.70.</P>

      <P>I could have made a handsome profit instead of leaving my money in the bank at 2% or 4%. Ordinary shares such as Eircom have shown the best capital growth over the past ten years and I am advised they will be better than property over a ten year period.</P>
      <P>All shares, even bank shares, go through peaks and troughs. Eircom shares were below the flotation price on 38 out of 238 days since they were floated. They rose rapidly after flotation, decreased during the autumn and winter and rose again in February 2000 to almost their highest level.</P>
      <P>Ordinary shares such as Eircom are in for the long haul. The recent slump is over and the price is rising daily &ndash; up 12 cents since yesterday. I am going to purchase more Eircom shares as this is a profitable company with a sound history.</P>

      <P>I am looking forward to the forthcoming dividends. I have two forms of shares and I am looking forward to the loyalty shares to be issued in July. One has to understand that share prices fluctuate up and down as a result of factors unconnected with a company. It could be fashionable to buy telecommunications shares today, IT shares tomorrow and bank or commodities shares next week. Shareholders should not panic but look to the long-term investment. That is the message we should send out rather than blaming the Government for matters outside its control. The performance of the market and the company will determine the future price of Eircom shares.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if Senator Ross is an Independent or a member of a party, but I agree with his assertion that Eircom shares will be seen as an historic steal in years to come. I am keeping my shares and I am buying more, and I am going to reap a harvest like all those who bought shares.</P>

      <P>Each party to a flotation has its own agenda. Management will be concerned with all aspects of the presentation of the company to the public and the price at which the company is floated. It is obvious the lower the flotation price the better the performance of the company and, by extension, the management's profile in the period after the flotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, it would be naive to <Col N="503" /> characterise the view of management as being objective.</P>
    <P>ABN AMRO, which acted as advisers to the company during the flotation, was a member of the bank syndicate which sold and acted as underwriters for the offering on behalf of the Government. If it did not believe the price of Eircom shares was reasonable, why was it prepared to sell the shares and underwrite the offering?</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made of the use of book-building as a means of setting a price at flotation. I am advised that the use of a book-building process, under which orders are taken from institutions across a price range as a basis for setting the final IPO price, is the most widely used method of undertaking IPO pricing. This is because the book-building method yields an IPO price that best fits prevailing market conditions and demands. I got that advice from different brokers today.</P>

      <P>I am not one of those who wakes up in the morning wondering about the prices of shares quoted on the FTSE, the Nikkei or the other economic indicators. It is naive in the extreme for the Opposition to talk about the ups and downs of Eircom shares when the world knows that the telecommunications industry is changing dramatically. Vodafone and Orange in the UK, Deutsche Telekom, KPN and Telia are all undergoing dramatic changes. That is as it should be in a rapidly changing industry.</P>
      <P>As other speakers said, people who invest in shares run the risk from time to time of getting their fingers burned. I suspect those of us who bought a few shares &ndash; I bought the minimum number &ndash; invested in them for the long haul and as much out of a sense of national loyalty as anything else. I did not expect that I would make a small fortune immediately from my investment in Eircom shares. I am concerned about the number of people who borrowed heavily and who may still retain those shares. The majority of people who borrowed to buy the shares offloaded them fairly quickly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pity the Opposition is availing of this opportunity to send out a message that can give investors erroneous perceptions of Eircom. The Government and Opposition are committed to a process of privatisation of other public sector companies. Therefore, it is important to maintain investor confidence. What we say at this juncture could potentially damage the company and, in particular, the interests of the shareholders. The <Col N="504" /> responsibility for any share price fall, and I hope that will not happen, lies fairly and squarely with the Fine Gael Members opposite. One cannot make a commitment that the shares of a floated company will not drop in price.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion seeks to censure the Minister and the Government partly on the basis that the offer documentation failed to make full disclosure of the position of the strategic partners. I strongly suspect that the majority of people do not read the small print in many of these documents. The small print was not that small. It was clearly indicated that the share price could go up as well as down. Sadly for those supporting the motion, the facts were made clear in the main prospectus and the mini-prospectus. The mini-prospectus was distributed to the 1.2 million people who registered their interest in purchasing shares. It stated that Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia agreed not to sell any of their shares for a period of six months after the completion of the offer, but would be free to sell their shares thereafter by way of a stock market offering or otherwise.</P>

      <P>The mini-prospectus goes on to state that in addition each of &ldquo;Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to acquire any additional shares for a period of 18 months from the completion of the offer provided that KPN Telecom is not restricted from increasing its shareholding in the company to a level not exceeding 29.9%&rdquo;. The offer documentation went beyond fully disclosing the position of the strategic partners. It also indicated the influence that decisions made by the strategic partners could have on the share price developments. The offer documentation did this in the context of setting out fairly the risks associated with investment in Eircom stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hate to bore Deputy Yates with these facts, but the mini-prospectus states that one should carefully consider the risks described and the information in the prospectus before purchasing shares. It states that the value of one's shares may be adversely affected by general market conditions and/or the possibility of further stock market offerings of the shares by, among others, KPN Telcom and Telia. It stated further that there could be no assurance that the shares would trade in the stock market subsequent to the offers at or above the price at which those shares were sold in the offers by the Minister. The mini-prospectus <Col N="505" /> stated also that if any of the risks summarised occurred, the company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of shares could decline. That demolishes the argument made in the motion on the lack of disclosure by the selling shareholder.</P>

      <P>Most people viewed that flotation as an opportunity to make a few pounds. Commentators agreed with Deputy Yates that this investment would be a sure bet. The banks were throwing money at people. It was never as easy to get money from the banks as it was to buy shares in Eircom,</P>

      <P>If investors were greedy, they had an ample opportunity to sell their shares and make a profit on their investment. Some investors who held on to their shares may have felt they missed the boat and I accept that many investors may have been investing for the first time and did not know when to sell. Many of them face that difficulty today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shares were floated at £3.90 and rose by more than 25% on the first day of trading and for more than 80% of time since the flotation Eircom has traded at or above its share price. Setting the price for Eircom shares was a very difficult task for the Government. On the one hand, it had to ensure the interests of the Exchequer and the taxpayer were protected, thus ensuring that the best price was secured. On the other hand, the Government had to ensure that the price was sufficiently attractive to ensure there was a strong demand for the shares. The Government struck that balance and it is madness to say otherwise. If Eircom's share price was overvalued, why has it taken the market so long to realise that? We can all be wise today. If the thousands of Eircom investors knew last year that Eircom's share price would be £3.20 today, I am sure they would not <Col N="506" /> have invested, but that is a risk people take when they invest in the stock market.</P>
    <P>Members referred to the mini-prospectus. It clearly set out the risks involved and potential investors were asked to carefully consider these risks before making their investments. Deputy Yates expressed concern for the investors who are now carrying paper losses of approximately 20% on their original investments. By highlighting the Eircom price in such a negative manner, it will only serve to depress the price even further. It is down 5 cents today. I am not attributing that to Deputy Yates, but this motion does not help matters.</P>

      <P>&mdash;benignly to the defence of the poor afflicted Eircom shareholder. Is that what politics has been brought to? The Opposition has been hysterical and irrational in its attempt to exploit the poor performance of the Eircom share price. Fine Gael and Labour are <Col N="507" /> acting like chat show hosts, indulging the public in false and unwarranted expectations about what can and cannot be achieved. The Labour Party, in particular, having abandoned socialism is clearly in favour of selling the family silver and, to make matters worse, it seems to advise the selling of the family silver at a double discount.</P>
      <P>From my humble background in telecommunications and journalism, and now in politics, it has always been my view that if one is a Minister charged with selling a public asset one should realise the maximum amount for the taxpayer from that asset. That is precisely what the Minister and the Government have done in relation to Eircom. A price was achieved on launch and a successful flotation occurred. The Government cannot be responsible for an asset it has sold. Eircom will no longer be an incumbrance on the public purse and that is as it should be. There was no guarantee of a high or middle range pricing of the Eircom's share price. It is interesting to note that Merrill Lynch advocated a higher value while AIB opted for a lower value and the Government, rather pragmatically, went for a figure in between.</P>
      <P>Eircom was an interesting but dangerous bet for any investor. That is not to say I did not invest, not because of any inside knowledge or great claim to knowledge about the industry.</P>

      <P>My good friend and former employer, Denis O'Brien, has gone from controlling a company which was a loss maker with massive debts to one for which somebody would offer him £250 million for his shares. It is a turbulent, changing, difficult industry with serious challenges for former monopoly utility players, such as Eircom. They are not as attractive today as prior to the Eircom flotation. The sentiment of the analysts in the industry has moved towards mobile telecommunication companies which are seen as a neater way of getting into the higher added value areas of the Internet, for example.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the Labour Party should pursue what can only be described as a Thatcherite agenda, complaining about the sale of the family silver, as Harold Macmillan accused Mrs. Thatcher of attempting to sell the family silver. It is unique and interesting and a sign of the times that the Labour Party is no longer complaining about the sale of the family silver but merely the price. That says much about what is being said here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two stark choices for the investor in Eircom, the short-term view or the long-term view. One was to invest either for the short-term, realising the short-term profit as happened in the case of the Eircom share price and getting out reasonably early, or for the long haul. The long haul is a difficult one for this company. While the company has huge value in it as a company, it has <Col N="508" /> huge problems in terms of staffing and fixed line costs. If Eircom decides to sell off to an investor the shareholders will gain on the double. If a major predator decides to gain market share in what is essentially a small market here then the investor would be well rewarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome many debates but this debate is the worst piece of political opportunism I have witnessed from Fine Gael since my election in 1997. The debate has done untold damage to the image of Eircom and will make it more difficult for Alfie Kane and those responsible for the operations of Eircom to roll the stone back up the hill. This is a position for which Alfie Kane and the management are responsible because they decided at an early stage in this debate to participate from the sidelines. That should not have happened. They have been diverted from the real game which is to ensure Eircom share prices go up, that a strategic partner is found and that a course is plotted for the future. Essentially, what they have done to date is to plot a course which is bringing that share down. They are fumbling at a time when they should be positive.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has led them into this position by this nonsensical and daft debate about the manner in which the shares were floated. We should not be talking about how the company is being run. It is out in the private market and is subject to market fluctuations. The manner in which the Minister brought this about is to be commended. She sought the best advice and was advised at one stage to sell for more. She took both sides of the argument into account, took note of the advice from Merrill Lynch and decided to go for a middle of the road value. That was a sensible approach. She has served the taxpayer and the Government well.</P>
      <P>It would be well for the Opposition to leave Eircom alone. One of the remarks made during the debate was how the public will react. I do not know what public the Opposition speaks about. I am not one who buys shares and I have not bought Eircom shares, but I am aware of the markets and that they can go up and down. Most of the punters who take a stake in shares of one kind or another are not afraid of what is happening because they realise more than the Opposition that the market will settle the final price of these shares. Given the developments that have taken place technologically throughout the world, these shares are set to go up in value.</P>
      <P>One of the Opposition's own, black sheep though he may be according to the Opposition, Senator Shane Ross, wrote a fine article on the whole issue. He gives more credit to the general public than the Opposition, which should take note of what it is saying and perhaps replay it over the next week. The Opposition should understand from this debate that it has lost the plot. The general public knows where these shares are going but above all it knows where the Opposition is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> The Opposition has come from nowhere. It has used this debate to place Eircom in a serious position and has not helped it in regard to its flotation It has thrown Eircom off the ball and Eircom will pay the price. I commend the Minister. She has adopted a positive approach and when the dust dies down after this debate, the public will see through Fine Gael, and buy shares and participate in the markets. They are fully confident of their position, but the Opposition do not seem to be confident of its position.</P>

      <P>I share the concerns expressed yesterday by my colleague, Deputy Yates, about the way in which this issue was handled, the consequences for the half a million citizens who bought shares and, most important, the implications of the misjudgment and mishandling of this, the first of a whole wave of privatisations, for future planned flotations. This was the most important one and the one that had to be right. That did not mean maximising the return to the Exchequer on this occasion. This was about taking the long-term view in getting the balance right and ensuring that the public had confidence in flotations by the State.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how, with all the hype surrounding this flotation, the preparation that went into it and the advice that was available, at a staggering and incredible cost of £73 million to the State, the Government should now have to answer such fundamental questions about the management of the issue.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting, as many on the Government side seem to think, that somehow the Government could have foreseen a Europe-wide drop in telecommunications shares. That is not what we are discussing. The reality is that Telecom Éireann shares were issued at a premium to the market of 30% and the public were not told. They are now trading at a discount to the general market. That could lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that the IPO was set too high. For this advice we paid a lot of money, or the Minister paid on our behalf.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise yesterday also sought to lecture us on the dangers of this debate for the share price. This is to misunderstand that what we are discussing here is the danger in which the Minister herself placed this share at the time of issue. The only danger to the share price now is criticism of the current management of the company and the Minister is leading the charge. I heard some of her Deputies saying things last night that will certainly affect the share price. The Minister has an unfortunate relationship with her chief executive officers, or her former chief executive officers, not just the one in question here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public depended on the Minister for sound <Col N="510" /> advice and that is what she owed to the public. She owed the public full disclosure of all of the facts. It was up to her and that was her vital function in this matter. She was targeting not experienced institutional investors but ordinary citizens, many of whom had never bought shares before, many of whom had to borrow the money to do so and had certainly not had any contact with the stock market before. These were people who were targeted by the Minister. Everybody over 18 got the glossy brochure.</P>
    <P>The two issues raised by my colleague, Deputy Yates, yesterday were not answered by the Minister. The first was about the intentions of Telia and KPN. It is all very well to point out that the prospectus told us, in the small or big print, that they could not sell for six months and that they could not buy for 18 months. What the Minister did not tell us is whether she knew at that time that they had no interest in remaining as strategic partners under the conditions which were being imposed and that there was, therefore, every likelihood that there would be an overhang of shares to be disposed of later on and that this would have implications in driving down the share price.</P>
    <P>The second matter with which the Minister did not deal was whether she made full disclosure as required under the rules of the Stock Exchange about contrary advice which may have been available from ABN AMRO Rothschild. Her response was that the report was a private one to Telecom Éireann itself and that it, therefore, could not be published. This makes no sense. At the time this was a public State-owned company. The State was the major shareholder and, by definition, it could not have a private report, certainly not a report that could be kept private if it contained information necessary to potential investors to help them make informed decisions.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister said repeatedly last night the price was set at the level the market was prepared to pay. Let me bring her mind back to what actually happened. In an extraordinary device the public had to decide how much to buy prior to being told the price they would have to pay. In a real market, the buyer and the seller have the same information. In this case the seller knew the supply, the demand the price. The buyer had none of this information. That is not a market in any real sense. In these circumstances, there was no risk to the Minister for Public Enterprise, no risk to the Minister for Finance and no risk to the underwriters. No wonder they chose to pitch the IPO at a higher level when they had full information about the demand for the shares. They could not lose.</P>
    <P>I hope &ndash; and I know that others share this view and I should declare that I was one of the unfortunate people who bought these shares too &ndash; that the underlying essentials of this company are sound and that eventually it will come right for all investors, that eventually the glossy brochures and the heavy sell and the balloons and the champagne will all be justified and that all the investors will have reason to celebrate. Right now <Col N="511" /> the only participant celebrating is the Department of Finance which extracted the very last penny from ordinary members of the public. However, even it will not be celebrating for long. In the market, as in politics, perception is everything and right now the perception of the public is that they were duped. In money matters, as in politics, the public have a long memory and they will not be duped again so readily. The questions surrounding this flotation have damaged the potential of all future planned flotations. The country will be paying again and again into the future as a result of the mishandling of this flotation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's tirade last evening that she has a difficulty with the concept of political accountability. The motion in the name of my party seeks to find out from the Government the truth about the flotation of Telecom Éireann last year. Specifically the House, the public and Eircom shareholders want the Government to account for its actions in respect of the Telecom Éireann flotation. Despite the Minister's protests to the contrary, it is legitimate for the House to express a view on the handling of the Telecom Éireann flotation precisely because politicians decided the strategy that was put in place. The motion has already shed much light on that strategy. Setting the price of the shares was a political decision. To suggest, as have some of the &ldquo;Gordon Gecko's&rdquo; on the other side of the House, that this should not be a matter of public discourse to be debated in the House is nonsensical.</P>
      <P>Last week this latest saga was sparked by the comments of Mr. Alfie Kane. Curiously, there was no reference to Mr. Kane in the Minister's speech in the House last night. She sent some of the lower orders here tonight to pour scorn on Mr. Kane. It is a pity she would not say what she has to say to his face. There can be little doubt that the comments of Mr. Kane on this issue express considerable dissatisfaction at the manner of the Telecom Éireann flotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that a matter of serious conflict between a semi-State company which was recently floated on the stock market and the majority shareholder, in this case the Government, cannot be discussed in Dáil Éireann is a bizarre notion. I would remind Minister O'Rourke that she had no difficulty in berating Eircell, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eircom, in the House some months ago when its network coverage collapsed for a time causing untold inconvenience to its customers. On that occasion, the Minister cut loose on the mobile phone operator demanding, no less, an apology from the company. The Minister was singing a different tune last evening when she said &ldquo;I shoulder a . reluctance to trade words across this House about a private company&rdquo;. No reluctance was shown when Eircell was treated to a dressing down from <Col N="512" /> the Minister some months ago. Times change, as do Ministers and their arguments.</P>
    <P>The goalposts were changed over the weekend when it became clear that the flotation decision was taken by a high-powered Cabinet sub-committee. It is clear that the headmistress of Carysfort does not want another disaster pinned to her political epitaph. Last night's speech was an attempt by the Minister to save her reputation in a Department where major decisions on public infrastructure have stalled during her period in office.</P>
    <P>Many within Fianna Fáil, particularly in its back bench team, see some similarities between the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and Margaret Thatcher. Both have a good reputation as good listeners and as persons who understand the subtlety of debate. However, they are different in one blatant respect. When Mrs. Thatcher sold off the family silver she did so at a price that encouraged ordinary people into the market. From the evidence we have heard in recent days this Minister and her Government viewed the Eircom flotation in a different light.</P>
    <P>What is most damaging in this debacle is that it puts at risk the future sale of other semi-State companies. As the hype of last summer died away thousands of small investors had their fingers burned in the Eircom experience. People with £4,000 or £5,000 to invest saw Eircom as a safe bet following the well-financed PR campaign before last July. The Government's decision to over-price the share could have a detrimental effect on the pension plans of many investors.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between a fair price for the sale of a public utility in order to guarantee the strategic future of that company and a bloated share price which does not reflect the market reality. Having siphoned off a large percentage of Eircom shares for financial institutions, a mere 30% of the holding was granted to small investors. The blatant fixing of the share price by the Government has hit small time investors hardest. The question must be asked whether Eircom shareholders would have purchased shares in such numbers had they known the more cautious advice that was given to the company and the Government last year. People were duped and the full facts were not known to many small investors.</P>
    <P>This scandal will have drastic consequences for the sale of other semi-State companies and, more crucially, for the medium to long-term prospects for Eircom and its shareholders. The key issue in this debate is who knew what and when. There can be no doubt the Minister, her Government colleagues and the board did not inform future investors in Eircom about the likely selling out of the shares by KPN and Telia.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear from the mini-prospectus that was not laid bare to the vast majority of people who wanted to invest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> One of the reasons for the deflated price in recent months is that a substantial amount of the shareholding was sold off by a large institution that managed to get its hands on the shares originally. It is quite clear that large institutions and companies got the best deal but small time investors got the worst one and are now paying the price. If there is not political accountability and if we cannot raise the matter in the House, what can we raise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Yates on raising this very important issue. The Government's statement that the company is no longer its responsibility is disingenuous because Eircom was mis-sold to investors. Eircom advisers were paid £58 million, over £180 for every shareholder, to set a price. They got their money but the first-time novice investors have lost more than 20% of their stake in less than a year. Government speakers have said that is a risk people take but we are talking about novice investors who never held shares previously. There was a high profile publicity campaign on RTE. Last week Mr. Kane said that it was known that the price set by the Government was 30% above the prevailing value at the time. The option of free shares was an incentive and a decoy to get people to hold on to their shares. They are not free shares. As things stand, those shares are costing people money. People are losing money. Eircom is one of the worst investments in Irish corporate history.</P>
      <P>The over-pricing of Eircom shares was an astonishing political blunder that will have severe repercussions for Irish investment. We are talking about the future off-loading of State assets. I am quite sure that none of the 488,000 shareholders will invest in them &ndash; they would have to be masochists to do so. A share buying culture aimed at companies could have been fostered in a generation of Irish people creating a rich pool of capital for Irish businesses, building enterprises and creating jobs. Banks openly gave loans to people to buy shares. People borrowed large sums of money and went into debt only to discover they made a substantial loss. The banks are getting their money on the loans.</P>
      <P>Many shareholders have had their fingers burned. They will not forgive the mis-selling of this asset. They were told &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass. This will come right in time&rdquo;.  People are losing 20% and it is projected that the value of the share could fall as low as 2.50. Banks and their advisers have questions to answer. The Minister took the advice of economists and advisers but, knowing the Minister, I believe she makes her own decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eircom shareholders want to know what happened to a share that reached a peak of 4.80 and has now dipped below 3. Investment in shares diverts money away from the general consumer. It is flittered away and drives up inflation. Many people considered they had the security of a Government sell-off. They thought it was a safe bet given the publicity surrounding it, including <Col N="514" /> champagne receptions with high profile people. However, people were less than honest with the investors. In business it is important to be upfront with people and to give them the facts. The Government should have been more businesslike and should have said it would come in at a lower price. It was greedy and going for gold.</P>
    <P>There was great hype about the millions of pounds that were received but people were stung. The sell off was little more than massive hype. People did not understand what they were getting into and little was done to explain the workings of the stock market to them. Those dealing in stocks and shares and those in business are familiar with flotations and the ups and downs of the market but many of those who bought Eircom shares were first time purchasers. We see this in the bill of sale for any purchase made. Little was done to highlight the negative aspects while the positive side was well publicised. We hear of the risks only in the aftermath of what has happened.</P>
    <P>For some it was a win-win situation. The banks are making money and the already full coffers of the Government were swelled. An important fact is that the decision by KPN and Telia to sell their shares at the earliest possible date resulted in an overhang of 776 million shares on the market. The problem is one of over supply thereby depressing the price. The Government has a responsibility as it encouraged people to buy into Eircom. It may not mean much to a Member of this House to lose £4,000 or £5,000 but there are those to whom that is a considerable amount of money. Their confidence in investing in shares has been severely damaged and the Government has done the country an injustice in the way it handled this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Yates for raising this important issue. Anyone who suggests that a decision by the Minister and the Government that has gone so wrong should not be challenged and discussed here is not being true to the democratic principles of the House. The Minister and the Government were irresponsible and negligent in not informing the public that KPN and Telia would not stay with the company if it failed to increase its shareholding above 35%. They now have a duty to those who purchased the shares to state why full information was not given to those who considered purchasing Telecom shares at the time of the flotation. The seriousness of the situation was not brought home to me until I heard the chief executive of Eircom, Mr. Alfie Kane, speaking on <i>Morning Ireland</i>. He stated that it was the view within Eircom's senior management that the share price was 30% above the prevailing Telecom value and that the Government had made the decision with that knowledge. The Government must answer the question as to why it hyped the price knowing that the shares were overvalued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wondered why the advertisements continued to be broadcast on television weeks after <Col N="515" /> it was known that the sale of shares would be oversubscribed. I believe the hype was to promote the Government and the Minister, and had nothing to do with the issue involved. The Minister has made an excuse that her advisers informed the Government on the price, but where were these advisers from? Did they say: &ldquo;There is an opportunity to make a killing; there are gullible people out there who will pay this price if the sales pitch is right&ldquo;? Did they say the sales pitch should be made to people who have no experience of purchasing such shares? Did they advise selecting people from the register of electors, hyping the chance of making a fortune, and hoping that the lottery syndrome would apply? This was at least unfair and at worst a con job. It showed callous disregard for up to one million small investors, many of whom borrowed to purchase the shares. Where are these people today? The Government has put them in a position where they have made substantial losses by paying back borrowings on negative equity.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why this happened. At a time when an unprecedented level of finances are flowing into the Exchequer, the Government introduced this hidden tax measure disguised as an opportunity to realise financial gain. It was nothing less than sleight-of-hand taxation whereby people paid money believing they would gain. In fact, it was a net gain to the Exchequer on shares that are now 30% less than their sale price.</P>
    <P>The propaganda stated that Telecom deserved a premium rating because it was the largest operator in the fastest growing economy in Europe, but the shares did not merit this premium. The Government must have been aware at the time that all the big players in Europe were off-loading shares in similar concerns in their own countries. While this was happening in Europe, the Irish public was being encouraged to buy Telecom shares and become investors for the first time. They were almost being guaranteed a profit. The Minister led the hype, ignoring the advice of the chief executive of Telecom, and launched the flotation at a suitable time. It is easy to compare what was done and the decision made by the investors as akin to the risk of backing horses, as the Minister has stated. However, the media hype, especially through television, left nobody who was considering an investment in any doubt other than that they would make substantial profits. They were told they were in for a killing, yet the small print quietly stated that &ldquo;shares prices can fluctuate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many of the ordinary investors involved &ndash; some of them elderly people of little means &ndash; invested their savings in the hope of improving their life circumstances in a small way. Others borrowed to invest, which was worse. As that great orator, Deputy Sheehan, said yesterday, &ldquo;this is the greatest debacle of all time&rdquo;. The Minister has not fully explained the reasons she made such a bad decision.</P>
    <Col N="516" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the substance of this motion, I would like to refer briefly to the first phase of the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, which was the strategic partnership agreement in 1996 in which I, as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, was directly involved. By the end of 1995, Telecom Éireann had made some progress in reducing its debt and in restructuring its tariffs. However, the company still had the fundamental problem that its cost base and general level of prices were much too high to sustain its viability in an increasingly open and competitive market.</P>
      <P>At that time, I was particularly concerned that these inefficiencies were being passed on to their customers, which was damaging to the overall competitiveness of the economy. Because of these factors, we decided to begin the process of selecting a suitable strategic partner who would help to accelerate the critically important change process within Telecom Éireann and provide the company with access to the latest technology, new expertise and international markets.</P>
      <P>After an exhaustive and detailed process, negotiations were completed in June 1996 on a strategic alliance between Telecom Éireann and a consortium made up KPN Telecom of Holland and Telia of Sweden. Under this arrangement KPN-Telia acquired 20% of the shares in Telecom Éireann for an initial downpayment of £183 million, with an option to buy a further 15% for £200 million after three years. This option was exercised in July 1999. In order to maximise the ultimate windfall to the taxpayer from this sale of shares, I insisted on the inclusion of a complex &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo; arrangement under which the actual price of the shares being sold to KPN-Telia would not be calculated until after the company was floated on the Stock Exchange. Therefore, the actual price to be paid by the new partners for their stake would be based on the value of Telecom Éireann at the time of its privatisation, rather than the book valuation in 1996. The ingenuity of this agreement was widely recognised by the financial markets, trade unions and IBEC at that time. When implemented, this strategic alliance brought immense benefits to Telecom Éireann itself and was instrumental in positioning the company for the advent of full competition and for privatisation.</P>
      <P>At the same time as this was happening, I was subjected to vicious criticism by Deputy Séamus Brennan, who is now a Minister of State, and was then the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Transport, Energy and Communications. In his usual cynical, negative and ill-considered way, Deputy Brennan castigated me, both in the House and outside it, for what he believed was a bad deal. He described it as a &ldquo;sell-out&rdquo;, &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; and &ldquo;a major financial scandal&rdquo;. He availed of every opportunity to repeat these allegations and to maliciously imply that the shares were actually being sold to KPN-Telia for the downpayment alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to set the record straight. The facts of that deal have since become <Col N="517" /> clear. The actual outcome of this agreement was a massive windfall payment to the State from KPN-Telia of £1.16 billion which was payable on 7 February this year. This sum was additional to the £383 million which had previously been paid. The total payment to the State, therefore, was more than £1.5 billion.</P>
    <P>To borrow Deputy Brennan's term, the real scandal in relation to this matter occurred under the watch of the current Government. Its failure to provide all relevant information to prospective purchasers of shares last year has left almost half a million small investors wondering what went wrong. In my view, the clear impression was created that KPN would be long-term investors in Eircom and that Telia would probably have to sell its stake because of its planned merger with Telenor, which is a partner in Esat Digifone.</P>
    <P>It was clear to me at the time of my involvement in negotiating with them, and this view is supported by many industry experts, that KPN would only remain as a long-term partner if it was ultimately able to acquire a controlling stake in the company. The conditions included in the Government's sale prospectus for Telecom, whereby KPN was prevented from increasing its shareholding, must have been discussed with KPN at the time. The question must be asked, therefore, whether KPN was satisfied with this condition or whether it indicated that it would precipitate its exit from Eircom. The answers to these questions must surely have been known at the time and should have been made public.</P>
    <P>Observing the way in which the IPO was promoted, it is obvious that these issues were deliberately downplayed and understated. By imposing this condition, the Government effectively excluded KPN, probably the only major global telecommunications company which expressed an interest in acquiring Eircom, from taking control of the company. The involvement of a major player represents the best opportunity for small investors to achieve the profits they hoped for when they purchased their share.</P>
    <P>The blame for the gross mishandling of this flotation has been passed around like snuff at a wake. The company management blame the Government and Ministers blame each other. During the hype, the glitz and the glamour of the launch, Minister O'Rourke was tripping over herself to take the credit and the glory. Now that the flotation has gone sour and angry shareholders are lining up for a target, the Minister and the Government have gone into hiding and are passing the buck back to the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to thank all colleagues for their contributions to the debate. I would like also to reassert that while the Minister for Public Enterprise and I are always happy to come into this House to debate issues and to share information on matters for which we have direct political responsibility, we feel a special responsibility to the shareholders in Eir<Col N="518" /> com not to make statements which in any way distort investor perceptions of the company.</P>
      <P>I wish to use this opportunity to reassert the basic case made at the outset of the debate on the Government side. First, there was no commitment that the shares of a floated company would never drop in price. The strict rules applying to international stock exchanges make this impossible. Careful attention was given to all information releases at all stages of the IPO process to ensure that the material was balanced and accurate.</P>
      <P>Second, in the 11 months since its flotation, the Eircom share has traded at or above its flotation price on all but 39 out of 234 trading days. The Government cannot be held responsible for the evolution of the share price in the market some 11 months after flotation. This is particularly apt given the recent weakness in technology stocks on international markets.</P>
      <P>Third, the offer documentation was scrupulous in setting out accurately the state of play with regard to the strategic partners in the company. This position was made clear in both the main prospectus and the mini-prospectus. This level of diligence and accuracy is a fundamental requirement of the stock exchanges which cleared the text of the prospectus.</P>
      <P>Fourth, the offer documentation set out fairly the risks associated with investment in the Eircom stock. The Minister set out the relevant contents of the mini-prospectus in summary form yesterday evening in this House. Fifth, it has been made quite clear that the decision of KPN to sell its stake is that company's decision alone. KPN has already stated publicly that its decision to sell has come about as a result of its strategy to focus more on the wireless business and its need to fund this shift.</P>
      <P>Sixth, the Government has stated the facts as they relate to the interface between the company and the process. The prospectus and the price range, which was set prior to the flotation, were agreed by both Government and the company. The final price of £3.07 was within this price range and just above the mid-point of the range. In summary, pricing of the shares in July 1999, as at any other time, involved balancing the need for a fair price for taxpayers and the need for a fair return for retail and institutional investors.</P>
      <P>Criticism was expressed from certain quarters in the immediate aftermath of the flotation that the price of the Eircom shares was set too low by the Government. The Government could have chosen to float the company at a higher price. It chose not to do so. Deputies are fully aware that in the immediate aftermath of the flotation, the shares rose in price by 20% and that the share has traded well above flotation price most of the time since the flotation. In the first three months of this year, the share price was never below the issue price and reached a high of £3.78 on a number of occasions in that period, a premium of 23% of the flotation price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government contends that this motion has <Col N="519" /> been put forward without regard to the interest of the shareholders in the company. The company advisers, cited by Deputy Yates as supporting a lower share price, also justified a valuation above the IPO price subsequent to the offer. In short, what we have here is an Opposition motion without the support of any credible evidence. It is a motion which instead exploits the present share weakness and, in particular, the position of Eircom shareholders. I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Crawford and Yates.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Yates on tabling the motion that has been debated both yesterday evening and this evening in the House. The attitude of the Government, and the extraordinary arrogance shown by the Minister yesterday evening and the Minister of State this evening, epitomises the contempt with which Fianna Fáil in Government likes to treat this Parliament as a parliamentary assembly. Members of this House are entitled to hold the Government to account when it gets things badly wrong. We are particularly entitled to hold the Government to account when instead of protecting the citizens of this country it seeks to exploit them in a cynical and disreputable way. To suggest that Fine Gael, or any Deputy, is irresponsible for raising the manner in which the share price flotation of Eircom took place is a gross failure to understand what this House does and its entitlements.</P>
      <P>The Minister said yesterday evening that no person in any country can make a commitment that the shares in a floated company will never drop in price. That is absolutely true. No one can make a commitment that the shares of any floated company will not drop in price. As someone who on occasion buys and sells shares, including Eircom shares, it does not cause me any great surprise when shares go up or when they go down. They often go up and down for the most irrational of reasons. That is not the issue. The issue is that Eircom was floated in the context of this State selling State assets, which are effectively owned by the citizens of this country, to raise funds for the Exchequer. The Government had a sacred duty to ensure that the price at which Eircom floated was one which it knew would reflect the true value of the company on the day of flotation.</P>
      <P>We have heard the Minister for Finance, and indeed the Minister responsible for this debacle, using the simile of people gambling on the horses. Putting money on a nag that it might go past the winner's post in the Curragh, the Galway races or at Leopardstown is different to investing in what was a State asset with the assurance of Government that the price at which it is selling this asset truly reflects the value of what is on offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now know that the Government has been misleadings us. We now know that, contrary to what has been stated, the chief executive of Eir<Col N="520" /> com was of the view, on the day when the share price was being fixed, that the fixed price was excessive as the market and the value of the company stood at that time. We now know that there was a report from ABN AMRO which warned that the share price should not be fixed at the level at which it was fixed by the Government, and we know that the Government went ahead and fixed this price without prior agreement of those responsible in Eircom. That is a disgrace. The report from AMRO that the Minister is suppressing should be published. It is not good enough for her to say that she telephoned Eircom last night and asked it to make it available. There is a public obligation to publish this report. If the Government has nothing to fear from it, it should not be suppressed.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one example of the type of problems we have currently in the economy. The Taoiseach was quoted in Saturday's <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that consumers should start questioning unjustified price rises more closely, as greedy traders raise prices simply because the economy is performing well. That was a warning from the Taoiseach. People who wish to rely on Government advice on the value of floated State assets should be careful of greedy Governments which want to exploit them because the economy is doing well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>The behaviour of this Government is disgraceful. Thousands of pensioners throughout the country bought these shares in good faith and in the belief the Government put them on offer at a valid price. If the price was valid, no one could complain in this House that the price was now somewhat below the flotation price because of variations in stock markets. However, we know the chief executive of Eircom believed the price to be too high. We know the board of Eircom was not consulted about the price that was fixed. The Minister of State and the Minister constantly talk about consultation on the range within which the price might be fixed. There may have been consultation on that, but the fixing of the price did not result from consultation.</P>
      <P>I do not believe any member of the public would ever again trust any member of the Government, be they Fianna Fáil or a Progressive Democrat, senior or junior Minister, enough to purchase anything from them. It was once said about an American politician that no one would buy a second-hand car from him. In the context of the Government's performance on this issue, I do not believe any member of the Government should ever be trusted by the public with the sale of a second-hand car or any State assets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for the opportunity to speak on this critical issue. I want to declare that I am a £1,000 shareholder in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 500,000 shareholders are watching the <Col N="521" /> fall of Eircom shares with fear and trepidation. Millions of pounds were spent on promotions by the Minister to encourage people to take part in this first major sell off. The public was advised by the Minister to take this great opportunity and that they could talk about it in the pubs at night. No doubt, if they can afford to go to the pubs they are talking about it at present.</P>
    <P>It is now clear from Mr. Alfie Kane's statement that it was known within Eircom that the Government's share price was 30% above the prevailing value. We all hope the price comes back up again for the sake of those who invested. Banks, credit unions and others did a major media blitz and offered special loans to investors. A person who bought £17,000 worth of shares now stands to lose £4,000. Many others, as a result of the publicity, withdrew their nest eggs which were earning low interest in bank accounts. They now find themselves with serious loans or capital losses, at a time when, as a result of increased inflation which is also due to the Government's mismanagement, they would, ironically, have benefited from higher interest rates if they had left their money in the bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that being in Opposition carries responsibilities. I cannot help, standing as I am behind our spokesperson, Deputy Yates, remembering the sort of responsibility shown by the then Opposition when BSE hit this country. The responsibility it showed was nil. It said that Libya, Iran and Egypt could be opened up again. It has been in Government now for three years but we have yet to see the results.</P>
    <P>The former chairman, Mr. Ron Bolger, was taken out by the same Minister. She replaced him with Mr. Brian Thompson, who had to resign because of a conflict of interests. The Minister further snubbed Mr. Bolger by ignoring him and his lifetime of public service by bringing in Mr. Ray MacSharry, who was chosen for political reasons &ndash; we have heard this week about jobs for the boys. Mr. Ron Bolger left his post as vice-chairman and resigned from the board. According to the media and many others, Mr. MacSharry had a long record of public service in this country and Europe. He was also a director of many companies and the chairman of Coillte. It is interesting that Coillte may be one of the victims of the Eircom difficulties. I understand it is no longer for sale. Mr. MacSharry was also a director of Galtee Deer Care. Many farmers in Cavan, Monaghan, Galway and elsewhere lost hundreds of thousands of pounds over that. There are efforts to bring some of those involved to court, so I will not dwell on it the matter.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister explained how she took advice from very expensive advisers. However, she did not always do that. She made the political decision and she deserves to take the rap for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who spoke in the debate. The Minister's protestations when this debate was announced that it would cause a run <Col N="522" /> on the shares has proved to have been disingenuous because, from the time the motion was tabled, the shares have shown a modest recovery. I am sure the shareholders wish there was a debate on it every week.</P>
      <P>I found it a little rich and somewhat ironic that the Minister in her speech last night accused me, Deputy Bruton, and the rest of the Opposition of ventilating &ldquo;half-truths, innuendoes and mad-cap conspiracy theories&rdquo;. She said in her speech:</P>
      <P>I would like to return now to the land of mad-cap theories. Deputy Yates appears to believe the report compiled by merchant bankers, ABN AMRO, for the company was suppressed in some way.</P>
      <P>The Minister described this as a mad-cap theory. Yet, on 1 December I wrote to Kevin Doyle, the freedom of information officer in the telecommunications division of her Department, to get a copy of the ABN AMRO report. I received a reply on 26 May that it could not be made available to me. I rang three times yesterday looking for it. The Minister rubbished me for a half-truth that this was suppressed, yet in the same speech last night she said the report will never be published because it is commercially sensitive data.</P>
      <P>That report vindicates what Mr. Kane said last week. He also said it at the time of the IPO. It is the Minister who is engaging in half-truths and pretending it is not being suppressed, when she is part of the procedure that is stopping the report, of which she possesses a copy, being published.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to tell another very serious half-truth. My information is rock solid on this. She said that KPN said Telia had to get out of the company for regulatory reasons because of the merger with Telenor and the stake in Esat. The theory &ndash; which was confirmed by the former Minister, Deputy Lowry &ndash; was that KPN would take up the slack. However, KPN went further. When it was in negotiations in the first half of last year, it said it wanted to be in a position to buy out the entire company, to go beyond the 29.9% threshold.</P>
      <P>The Minister let the cat out of the bag last night when she said &ldquo;The only point I want to make at this stage is that there was little point in floating Eircom only to have an immediate takeover of that company in the aftermath of flotation&rdquo;. Who might be interested in a takeover of the company? None other than KPN itself. When it was told it could not buy the company out, it said it was off.</P>
      <P>It is the fact that KPN left and that 776 million shares are overhanging the market, rather than what I or Alfie Kane have said, that is driving the price of Eircom shares below their IPO sale level. There is a glut of shares. They are prepared to do a secondary offering at a 10% market discount and a further 5% institutional discount. The heart of the problem is that Alfie Kane let the cat out of the bag last week and that the full details of what happened with KPN were never told to the shareholders at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> Almost every Fianna Fáil speaker used a quotation of mine where I said this was a sure bet and a good investment. I made those comments in April. The IPO was in July. When I heard the process was that one had to register and subscribe first and the price would be set afterwards, I told anyone who asked my opinion that that was a dubious practice and not to be recommended. Of course, it is of interest to the Minister's spin doctors to represent me as the one who was promoting the shares. However, the Minister was the one jetting to New York and the one with the balloons, skydivers and champagne, who was hyping this and who spent a budget of almost £20 million bamboozling the public on radio and television to buy these shares. Now that the flak is <Col N="524" /> hitting the fan, what does she do? She blames the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, for setting the price. She wanted a much lower price. Last year she was like the school mistress giving the pupils a free day but this year she is putting up her hand when there is bad news and saying &ldquo;Not me, sir, it was them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The truth is that permanent damage has been done to the credibility of future privatisation and IPOs because the trust of the people in the Government &ndash; that it would be an honest broker and would not make a quick buck &ndash; has been betrayed by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and this Government, and they will never be caught again, much to the detriment of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been long in gestation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a solemn promise to the House that changes in the licensing laws would be enacted in advance of the summer recess. However, it was the 1999 summer recess that the Minister had in mind. In the Seanad he described this as a comprehensive measure. He also said that in formulating the proposals he had sought submissions from the &ldquo;length and breadth of the country&rdquo;. It is indicative of his approach to this matter that subsequent to this inordinate delay in bringing the measure before the House and consequent to his submissions up and down the country, one of the provisions in the new Bill establishes a new commission on licensing.</P>
      <P>In effect, the Minister is saying that after two years of consideration, after a committee of the House deliberated and reported on the matter and after taking submissions from &ldquo;the length and breadth of the country&rdquo;, as the Minister said, he is now to set up a commission to continue with this process. Far from being comprehensive, this Bill is a stopgap measure bringing together some elements of the proposals that were put to the Minister by various interested parties. That is regrettable. It is important that a comprehensive final draft of licensing regimes is brought before this House and enacted so that the various interests can be balanced and a determination made. I have no objection in principle to the concept of a commission on licensing but the fact that a commission is required to do the job that was taken on by the Minister and is the proper preserve of this House is an admission of failure.</P>
      <P>I have only a few minutes to deal in detail with the provisions of the Bill. The most vexed question and the one which has caused most debate is opening hours. The Bill deals with the opening hours permitted to licensed premises and clubs. However, if one attempts to read the section relating to the permitted opening hours, one will find the most convoluted, impenetrable legal speak ever put on paper. The opening hours take up a full page of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This legislation, much vaunted by the Minister as a Bill to bring clarity to the licensing laws, brings together all sorts of suggestions in a mishmash that is impossible for the average citizen to read or understand. If I had sufficient time I would read section 3 into the record as an example of impenetrable legalese and gobbledegook. It refers to when St. Patrick's Day falls on a certain day, Christmas eve and the eve of Good Friday between certain hours, and the eve of any public holiday other than Christmas eve. It is like a soothsayer's guide, if there is a full moon followed by the Michaelmas term, one subtracts the date one was born and one might be allowed to open the pub. It is incredible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Good Friday fell on Easter Monday; it was a racehorse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>When one gets through all that and trawls through the eves of holy days, public holidays, bank holidays, one's birthday and one's best friend's favourite number, one reaches section 3(1A) which states: &ldquo;The hours specified in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) in respect of any day specified in that paragraph are in addition to the period between midnight and 12.30 a.m. on that day where that period is included in the hours so specified in respect of <Col N="527" /> the eve of that day.&rdquo;  Is that not clear? It is gobbledegook.</P>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach had an input into drafting the opening hours and, in good nanny state style, he determined that there should not be late opening on Sunday nights because the labouring classes might be unable to get up to do their work on Mondays. That patronising attitude was common at one time in the licensing regime in Australia. People were obliged to go into drinking houses to guzzle as much drink as they could in a limited period. I thought we had left that type of thing behind. This Bill will put in place three basic regimes of opening hours and a number of sub-regimes and bring anything but clarity to the matter.</P>
      <P>Section 4 deals with premises engaged in a mixture of retail activity, that is, the licensing regime for supermarkets and the new developing premises which provide petrol and a variety of other services. The opening hours will be changed from 9 a.m. on weekdays to 7.30 a.m. and from 12.30 p.m. on other days, except on 23 and 24 December. They can sell liquor from 8 a.m. on weekdays. These premises, therefore, can open at 7.30 a.m. but can only sell liquor from 8 a.m. The assistants will probably have to stand shotgun for an hour and a half lest the alcoholics get loose among the liquor aisles during the time before permitted hours. This type of nannyism is daft and should be tackled.</P>
      <P>We still have not addressed the issue of opening on Good Friday. The blanket prohibition on the sale of alcohol on Good Friday is out of kilter with growing secularism and with the notion that people should be allowed to establish their own regimes. If people wish to have religious observance, it should not be enforced by the law of the State. The fact that the old regime will still prevail on Good Friday, where premises will be unable to open because they sell intoxicating liquor in addition to a range of other goods, is unacceptable and wrong.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with nightclubs, disco operators and special exemptions. It quite properly abolishes the requirement that meals be provided with special occasion exemptions. Subsection (1)(f) introduces a requirement that the new hours permitted for exemptions not cause undue inconvenience to local residents. This is welcome although I do not know how it will work in practice. However, it is true that throughout the country certain late night disco licences can have an extremely deleterious effect on neighbourhoods. I welcome the provision that the court must have regard for the inconvenience to local residents in determining the exemption but I am not convinced as to how it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 deals with hotels and restaurants and is another example of the nanny state. On Christmas Day hotels and restaurants are allowed to sell intoxicating liquor between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. and between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., presumably to allow people have a drink with their lunch and <Col N="528" /> dinner. Will there be somebody in the restaurant with a stopwatch on Christmas Day? If somebody has a glass of champagne with their family in the restaurant before 1 p.m., will they be committing a criminal offence? Is that not daft and silly? Is it not time we got away from drafting regimes which impose unrealistic burdens on people, which will not be enforced and which, if they are, are daft? I support the extra hour of permitted hours on other days.</P>
    <P>Part 3 deals with underage drinking. I strongly support the new measures which provide for a severe penalty for those who sell drink to minors. There should be extremely strong laws in relation to underage drinking. It should be deterred in the same way as in the United States. However, people have, for some reason, equated liberalising laws in relation to opening hours with strict laws on underage drinking. There is no correlation between the two.</P>
    <P>This is a hotchpotch Bill. It does some good and some bad but it is far from the comprehensive Bill that was promised and far from the overarching legislation that should have been produced after two years gestation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin" hpid="Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Unfortunately, however, my time is limited and I cannot deal in detail with the issues I hope to raise.</P>
      <P>I welcome many of the initiatives in the Bill, particularly the provisions relating to people who sell liquor to underage persons. This is a huge issue throughout the country. While many publicans and owners of off-licences are concerned about this issue and would not sell drink to minors, there is a number who do sell it. Unless a strict identity card system is put in place, it will be extremely difficult to police this section. The Minister must ensure that the law is enforced. There are many laws but they are of little use if they are not enforced.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he consulted widely about this Bill. I am sure that one of the more vocal groups he met was the parents of young children and teenagers who are able to buy drink and get drunk in pubs. I was speaking to a 16 year old friend of mine recently who is studying in university. Her friend, who is also 16 years of age, is from the United States. When the exams were over her friend from the US was boasting that she was now looking forward to going out and getting drunk. When that girl will go back home to America she will not get drunk, she will not even get a drink. It is about time we dealt with this issue and I commend the Minister for beginning to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take on board a couple of issues. The first issue relates to small supermarkets which are losing business to the larger multinationals because they have no facility to sell liquor. I ask the Minister to listen to the genuine concerns of these people. I will quote from a letter I received from a small super<Col N="529" /> market owner in my constituency in Kerry. The letter reads as follows:</P>
    <P>I am currently employing 8 people in an area where there is little other employment. My family have been in business for over 100 years and have managed to date to survive in the face of increasing competition from big multiples. Competition has increased in the past 6/7 years. The multiples, which have stores only 8 miles away have increased opening hours and are now selling newspapers and lotto, as well as intoxicating liquor. I really feel I am losing business by not having an off-licence. I am always going to be by-passed by the busy consumer for a store where the product range is larger.</P>
    <P>I received another letter which reads:</P>
    <P>.. the liquor licensing laws in this country are outdated in comparison to other European countries where you can go into any supermarket and buy drink. As you know shops over the years, either in cities, towns or country have closed down due to the high level of competition from multinationals.  </P>
    <P>Again rural Ireland will suffer. I ask the Minister, who comes from a constituency with many small supermarkets, to listen to the concerns of these people and give them fair play.</P>
    <P>Another issue to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention is Sunday night closing hours. I cannot understand why pubs must close earlier on Sunday night than on weekend nights. For example, people from Kerry who travel to football matches or race meetings in Dublin like to have a social drink when they return home but, unfortunately, there is no way people from Dingle, Cahirciveen, Killarney and Kenmare, which is five or six hours drive from Dublin, can have a social drink after they arrive home from these sporting events. The Minister, who comes from Cahirciveen, will understand this aspect and should do away with this draconian law to close pubs earlier on Sunday night. I would like to raise many other issues but, unfortunately, my time is up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 19th century it was said that brewers controlled the liberal party. It must be said, given this anaemic Bill before us, that brewers, publicans and supermarket interests have a major influence on the two conservative parties in this House. The Bill just tinkers with the important issue of our social lives but does not introduce fundamental reforms. I acknowledge that pubs and hostelries have played a useful role in public life in providing accommodation, rooms for public meetings and so on. However, it is the duty of this House to legislate for all sectors of society, particularly in the important area of alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are gross restrictions on the issuing of licences in the four Dublin County Council areas where there are 1.2 million people. There are <Col N="530" /> approximately 657 licences in this area, whereas the rest of Ireland has approximately 7,000 licences. This is a key issue which the Government should address. This has resulted in grotesque profiteering in the area of alcohol with profits of £2, £3, £4 and £5 per drink in public houses throughout Dublin and Ireland as reported in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>. These massive profits and the spiralling cost of beers, shorts and mixers are a major imposition on people leading a normal social life and is an issue the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, should have tackled. Deputy Rabbitte, as Minister of State, was prepared to control prices in this area but the present Government as usual has flunked addressing this important lobby.</P>
    <P>I welcome sections 13 and 14 governing the sale of alcoholic drinks to underage persons and the abolition of the reasonable grounds defence. As the Deputy opposite from the north Dublin region knows, people living in the northern and western fringes of the city are plagued on three, four or five nights a week by gangs of underage youths, some as young as 12, 13 or 14, carrying plastic carrier bags and drinking in open spaces and parks. These plastic carrier bags carry no names, therefore the sellers cannot be identified. Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies should have addressed this issue. These youths cause mayhem and disturbance of the peace for the gardaí and residents. This issue has been ignored totally by Members on the opposite side of the House and this constant mayhem is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil promised in its election manifesto to introduce community wardens to deal with this issue. Since then nothing has happened on these anaemic ideas about park wardens and so on. There has been no co-ordination between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment and Local Government in relation to by-laws. Dublin City and Fingal County Councils have no by-laws at present on drinking in open spaces. There is no attempt to place responsibility on the brewing industry and publicans throughout the area.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to address the issuing of licences. The legislation has not attempted to look at a proper ratio of licences for the burgeoning districts of Dublin north, Dublin west and so on. Areas with approximately 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 people are served by perhaps three, four or five pubs. Vast drinking halls cater for 600 or 700 people. The Bill does not address this fundamental issue which is at the route of many of our problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the changes on trading hours. When I was Labour Party spokesman for Enterprise, Trade and Employment I held meetings with Mandate and representatives of the brewers and publicans. I made various demands at the time in relation to shift systems and extra wages for late night work from which I hope workers will benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, by and large. However, I am concerned about the effects the extended opening hours will have in the Dublin area, as in many urban areas, on adjacent residential areas where I have yet to see a pub which closes on time. There are a few notorious pubs in my constituency where the shutters are closed at approximately 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. People are being served in these pubs at all hours of the night. The provision in the instruments underpinning this legislation must ensure that people who live near public houses can have a decent night's sleep and get up in the morning.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on Part 3 of the Bill relating to the amendment of provisions relating to underage persons. My good friend, Fr. Micheál McGréil of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, made very good observations in that regard. As Deputy Broughan said, when we talk about underage drinking in the area he and I represent, one is talking about 10, 11, and 12 year old youngsters who, as a matter of course on Friday afternoon after school, go to the local off-licence or pub and, without difficulty, can get Dutch Gold, Red Bull or cider in unmarked plastic bags.</P>
      <P>The Minister might take on board the need to have clear identification marks on bags used to carry alcohol from off-licences. People get blotto in our parks and open spaces and usually end up with a &ldquo;company car&rdquo;, as we call it in Dublin, break some windows and cause mayhem. This must be tackled. Will the Minister look at provisions which could be introduced? Dublin City Council tried to deal with this problem by way of by-laws &ndash; which will restrict or prohibit drinking in public places such as parks. There are alcohol-free zones in some towns in Northern Ireland. I was in Coventry recently, where there is a huge problem with under age drinking with gangs gathering in the city centre at all hours of day and night and where a complete ban was introduced on drinking in open spaces and public areas, which has worked. In many states in the US a person with a can or a beer bottle in the back of a taxi can be prosecuted on the spot. The problem is so extensive in Ireland we need to address it with, unfortunately, fairly draconian measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health warning on drinks containers should be introduced given the amount of disruption to family life and health caused by the abuse of alcohol. I met a bright and breezy 16 year old alcoholic last Friday whom I taught a number of years ago. He is very intelligent but drifted into alcohol abuse and without extensive counselling will be in that way of life for a long time. The drinks industry should bear part of the cost in ensuring that person is looked after. There is no reason measures similar to those taken against the tobacco industry should not be taken against <Col N="532" /> the drinks industry. The Cider Industry Council is doing its bit and funding programmes, although I am not sure how effective they are.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin mentioned something very dear to my heart, namely, an enforceable ID scheme for young people which we must introduce. In the part of the city I represent we had a watch card which was introduced by some community gardaí. In some pubs it was accepted and regarded as bona fide but in many places it was abused and youngsters were able to forge the cards, and in the end it simply did not work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 13(3) which places the onus on publicans to prove they have not sold drink to an under age person. If that is enforced in conjunction with a proper ID system we will see an improvement.</P>
    <P>The Bill in general is very welcome, but I need to be convinced that we can introduce measures restricting the ability of young people to get alcohol at off-licences, pubs, etc. I also need to be convinced that we have the commitment to introduce a wide-ranging and enforceable ID scheme. Otherwise what we see in our parks, on our streets and everywhere else, particularly at weekends, will continue and get worse.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the Bill, although I have certain reservations about it. My view, which I have discussed with the Minister on a number of occasions, is that there should be complete deregulation of the drinks industry and that pubs should be allowed close whenever they so wish. In Enniscorthy I see gardaí driving around the town at closing time and visiting half the pubs which is a waste of their time &ndash; they would be far better off looking after the community, something the Minister should seriously examine. The UK is currently going down that road and perhaps in some years we will also take that direction. However, the Minister does not think it is the road to take at the moment, and neither do some publicans.</P>
      <P>I have nothing against drink, but glossy advertising on television, in cinemas and all over the place encourage young people to drink. The Minister for Health and Children talks about banning all cigarette advertising, but neither he nor the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seem to have plans to ban drinks advertising. I agree with Deputy Carey that a health warning on drinks bottles and cans is as important as a health warning on packs of cigarettes and the Minister should consider banning the advertising of alcohol on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding sections 13 and 14, under age drinking has been a big issue for many years and publicans and successive Governments seem at loggerheads as to how it should be resolved. An ID scheme was suggested for quite a long time and I know some publicans implemented it, but it did not work. It is necessary for the Government and publicans to examine the scheme again in co-operation with each other. A proper enforceable <Col N="533" /> ID scheme could be funded jointly to deal with under age drinking.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the VFI to just run away from under age drinking. It knows there are some cowboy operators among its members who are serving drink to people who are under age. The VFI is turning a blind eye to this and is not taking any action against its members, which is very serious. We all know some publicans and off-licences provide young people with drink. This is not just confined to Dublin &ndash; the problem also exists in other urban and rural areas where young people are gathering in parks, at cross-roads and in town squares to drink cider and all kinds of new and fancy drinks which they are buying in off-licences and from publicans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin suggested the names of publicans and off-licences should be on all bottles and cans, and it is probably something we should consider, given that we hear much talk about traceability. It would involve publicans having their names or the company's name on the drink they sell, particularly on flagons of cider.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about discos. I live in Enniscorthy, a small town, where every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night when the five disco halls close at 2.00 a.m., 5,000 people are dumped on to the street at the one time. Under the new legislation the time will probably change to 3.00 a.m. or 3.30 a.m. There are rows, bottle throwing and all sorts of problems with which the Garda have to deal. The disco owners close the doors and pull down the shutters and it is left to the local community and the Garda to deal with the situation. The Minister must seriously examine how this problem can be dealt with. I am sure the problem is not confined to Enniscorthy but is the same in every urban centre. These crowds of people, who emerge from discos at the same time, converge on two or three chippers and cause mayhem and inconvenience local people.</P>
    <P>Seaside resorts in Wexford have major problems with drinking in public places and the county council recently introduced a by-law to ban drinking in public places this summer in Courtown as a pilot scheme because Dublin louts come down and cause mayhem at the weekends. We just do not want them in Courtown or in any part of Wexford. Some people say it may not be possible to implement the by-law, but it is worth a try and if it is successful we will extend it to other parts of the county.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, although I feel it has not gone far enough. However, it is a start and perhaps at some future time we can take it a stage further.</P>

    <P>As someone who has a background in the licensed trade I welcome the Minister's decision to make comprehensive changes to the licensing laws. In doing so he is responding to an obvious need and reflecting the more acceptable of cur<Col N="534" /> rent trends in the area of drinking. If anyone has doubts about the seriousness of the consumption of alcohol to excess or the need to control its supply, all he or she need do is read the reports of hooliganism on the return train journey from Cork following the hurling game last Sunday.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. The system will have to change.</P>
      <P>I have always believed that there is an adequate number of liquor licences. Even after the extinction of a good number in recent years there are still enough premises, although their distribution could be more advantageous from the point of view of patrons. In almost every other trade or profession the location of the business or service is dictated by need in a given area. Premises change and businesses relocate as necessary to follow the available custom or to locate where the number of customers is greatest. Such businesses are customer driven.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals to introduce more flexibility in regard to the movement of licences. Trying to make a living from a public house in an area which is fast depopulating is an uphill struggle. The Minister's proposals will make the realisation of a publican's assets much easier. This is only right. I have always questioned the correctness of requiring that two licences be extinguished before a new one can be granted. The current proposal of a one for one system is much more equitable and realistic and is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with many others I congratulate the Minister on his proposals in regard to underage drinking. The depth and extent of the problem is not fully understood. If it is not tackled head on the seeds of huge problems in the future will be sown. There will have to be programmes of education aimed at teenagers to inform them fully of the effects of youth drinking. In the wake of the proposal of the Minister for Health and Children to eliminate all cigarette advertising, much the same course will have to be considered for drink. Medical and hospitals statistics alone demand that this be looked at, if only on economic grounds, leaving aside the moral and medical aspects. Young people are drinking on people's walls in housing estates and generally <Col N="535" /> causing a nuisance. It is a difficult problem with which to deal but it must be tackled.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are difficulties in regard to the identification of underage drinkers and the establishment of their correct age. I am well aware that young people are very inventive with computers, scanners and copiers and can produce plausible, if false, identification in a matter of minutes. I am also aware that identification is being bought in the United Kingdom and seems to be readily acceptable to accommodating licensees when presented. Regardless of what the civil libertarians have to say, it is long past time when we had an official identification system that works. In some areas the Garda Síochána and vintners organisations came together to operate such a system but they seemed to fall through very quickly.</P>
    <P>While there does not seem to be the will to enforce the law on underage drinking, I am aware that many conscientious vintners would welcome a realistic official and universal form of identification which would be recognisable throughout the country. The necessary mechanism is in place. It is a matter of highlighting it and making it work. Figures released in recent months indicated that 7,154 identity cards had been issued, of which 247 had been issued in my constituency of Waterford. Only 25 had been issued in Limerick which has a huge urban population. It is obvious that the matter is not being taken seriously.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the reasonable belief defence is being removed. The necessary machinery must be put in place to help co-operative vintners operate within the law and require the rogue element to obey it. I honestly believe that the rogue operators will obey it because the necessary sanctions are being put in place. My 16 year old daughter was able to point out a number of her classmates in photographs recently carried in some local newspapers of people out having a drink. Is someone telling me that the licensee concerned is operating in a responsible manner? He could easily cut this practice out if he wanted to. He will be made do so by the sanctions being put in place.</P>
    <P>The adjustments in opening times proposed by the Minister are adequate and well balanced. Those who look for longer opening hours or a free for all, normally demanded on the grounds of tourism, are not looking at the facts. Most tourists are drawn from American coach tours, are of mature age and, as residents, have access to a drink in their hotel. Many others come from Great Britain where there is no culture of late night drinking. Those who holiday on the Continent know that towns and villages are largely deserted after 9 p.m. The Minister's proposals are reasonable and realistic and should be fully endorsed.</P>
    <P>There should be greater flexibility in regard to area exemptions in respect of which local conditions should be taken more fully into account. Blanket extensions benefit those located in the <Col N="536" /> centre of an urban area and are of little use to those on the outskirts. There should be flexibility whereby local pubs should be able to apply for an exemption when the local GAA club reaches the county final.</P>
    <P>The proposal to allow restaurants with a wine licence to serve beer with meals makes common sense and should have been provided for years ago. It should be extended to include the serving of Irish coffee.</P>
    <P>This is a sensible Bill. Its proposals are long overdue and I wholeheartedly support its provisions.</P>

      <P>The broad welcome the Bill has received within the industry is an indication that it contains many welcome provisions. I disagree, however, with those who think that it will satisfy the industry for many years to come. The importance of the changes in the hours of opening and the measures under which publicans can be punished for serving alcohol on the premises to those who are under age must be highlighted, but whether we like it, unless there is a complete change of attitude among the population nothing will change. Young people must be educated not to look on drink as the priority or focus of their entertainment activities. This can be done to the benefit of society as a whole.</P>
      <P>One can glean from local newspapers the numbers of people involved in court cases directly related to drink, whether it be drink driving, persons found on premises or publicans violating opening hours, and the number of hours members of the Garda Síochána are diverted from their direct professional duties in policing opening hours. That is the downside to the Bill. Three different sets of opening hours in the week will lead to further confusion and cannot be policed, leading to an inevitable increase in the need for the Garda and the courts to take further action.</P>
      <P>Under age drinking is one of the major problems facing us and it is sad that many sporting and youth entertainment events are focused on alcohol. Some publicans, particularly those in rural areas, did not ever open after hours and did not serve alcohol to under age persons. However, some of the people now leasing licensed premises for a year or longer are a scourge and are giving the industry a bad name. These people are only interested in profit and will do anything to get an extra pound out of the customer's pocket, even if it means serving long into the night. The Minister must examine the leasing of licensed premises by fly-by-night merchants who do not belong in the industry. These people are only interested in a quick kill after which they will get out, with serious consequences in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> I acknowledge the work done by many community workers, particularly those who give of their time voluntarily to organisations like the No Name Club and who organise entertainment and social events for young people away from the environment of drink. I hope the Minister will alter the Bill in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill and it is important to upgrade the Acts of 1833 and 1904. However, there is an absence of a mandatory age card system and courts must have discretion in the closure of pubs where, for instance, a customer purchases alcohol for an under age person. Under the Bill, a publican can be closed down for up to 7 days for a first offence and up to 30 for a subsequent offence, without actually having committed an offence. It will be very difficult to police this measure.</P>
      <P>I welcome the one for one system as the transfer of licences involved high legal costs. This measure will open up the system because one will not need to extinguish two licences to create one new licence. The three different sets of opening hours in a week will be confusing for the trade, staff, customers and tourists in particular. If only people over 18 are entitled to be on a licensed premises with an exemption into Monday morning, there is no reason pubs should be forced to close at 11.30 p.m. They should be permitted the same opening hours as on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Absenteeism on Mondays is not caused by pubs staying open until 11.30 p.m but by people staying in discos until 2.30 a.m. and 3.00 a.m. The three sets of opening hours will cause great difficulties.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that new pubs can be created in large urban areas. A cartel has operated in large cities and this measure will open up the trade. I am glad the courts will have discretion as to whether a person is deemed suitable to hold a licence in a new urban estate as it will create competition which is the best form of trade. Cartels in large cities meant that people could increase the price of alcohol without regard to the Minister or consumer associations. It is to be welcomed that new pubs will now be opened in growth centres and large urban areas.</P>
      <P>I have a special restaurant licence since 1988 under which alcohol can be served with a meal. This was a significant innovation and I welcome the change whereby a restaurant which holds a wine licence will be able to sell beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue which is not addressed in the Bill and about which I am concerned is the creation of off-licences. It is very difficult to police the current arrangements with regard to under age people and the same debate took place concerning cigarettes. Responsibility must be placed on operators but it is very hard to police this measure in establishments where most people are staff driven. An age card system can overcome the difficulty of sales of alcohol in off licence premises. A significant programme of education is needed in homes and schools to make people aware of <Col N="538" /> the dangers of alcohol. There is no point in placing all the responsibility on proprietors as that is unfair.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the creation of off-licences in towns and villages, leading to greater prosperity. I welcome these important changes but I appeal to the Minister to look at the issue of off-sales now that towns and villages are experiencing growth. Such licences would be important for continued growth, particularly for supermarkets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate if not all the contents of the Bill. Some of the measures are progressive and, given the industry is so powerful, perhaps we will make hay slowly and we cannot achieve all the changes we desire over night.</P>
      <P>Members received correspondence from various vintners groups. I received correspondence from the Licensed Vintners Association expressing reservations about Part V of the Bill which allows restaurants to sell beer. The association fears this will lead to the demand to sell Irish coffees and, ultimately, spirits being available in restaurants, leading to more drinking establishments. However, I support this measure. This is the thin end of the wedge and this measure can lead to more outlets being opened.</P>
      <P>There are 23 pubs in Macroom which has 2,500 people yet in some large urban centres there may be only one pub serving 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 people. I welcome any measure which facilitates greater competition in the drinks industry because, ultimately, it will benefit consumers.</P>
      <P>The measure regarding closing times furthers the concept of the nanny state or Big Brother telling people when to go home. I have some sympathy for Deputy Browne's argument for total deregulation. Rome will not be built in a day and the Bill has some welcome provisions with regard to extending opening hours. However, the differentiation between Monday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday nights is ludicrous and farcical, and we are making a laughing stock of ourselves. Deputy Howlin referred to Good Friday but these anomalies should be ended by this Bill. It would not have been a step too far to have a single closing time and that should have been provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>One or two pubs in every town depend on under age drinking for the majority of their trade and I welcome any measure which clamps down on such rogue traders. Some traders argue, with reason, that they cannot be sure if drink served to adults is not being given to under age drinkers, and a national ID system should be examined in that context. However, if we are against the nanny state we have to encourage parental and individual responsibility. We must encourage individuals to take responsibility for their actions. That requires a change of culture, which will not be achieved overnight by the introduction of legislation, although it is something for which we must strive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State at the <Col N="539" /> Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who also has responsibility in the Department of Health and Children, is present. The latest drink phenomenon is vodka and Red Bull. There is ample anecdotal evidence to suggest that such high energy drinks are responsible for much of the gratuitous violence that occurs inside or in the precincts of licensed premises and night clubs in any town on a Friday or Saturday night. We often hear on the news headlines the following morning that a person has been stabbed or killed. The Garda mentioned this drink as being a contributory factor. That drink is banned in certain jurisdictions and it is necessary that we refer the matter to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for final arbitration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this legislation a first step in transforming our licensing laws. The preparation of this legislation has been quite rushed, as many of us have called for its introduction. It is understandable, therefore, that it is not as comprehensive as we would like.</P>
      <P>I said previously that we should not have any licensing laws. Licences should be deregulated. It is a nonsense that the time of gardaí is taken up policing public houses. That should not be necessary. Their time should be devoted to solving crime and anti-social behaviour, which is very prevalent on our streets. The anti-social and lewd behaviour of our young and not so young is unacceptable. It is time a concerted effort was made to stamp it out.</P>
      <P>We heard much about zero tolerance when the Government was in opposition. I am not one to be over-critical of Governments as they have a difficult job to do. We need a zero tolerance approach to this type of behaviour in public places. Such behaviour is not confined to O'Connell Street and the centre of Dublin, it is prevalent in provincial towns and even in small towns and villages. People feel it is not safe to walk the streets at night. The problem of such anti-social behaviour, much of it due to the drunkenness of people who are not old enough to be legally entitled to drink, must be tackled in a comprehensive rather than a piecemeal manner, but this legislation is piecemeal in its approach.</P>
      <P>The abuse of drink in this country is a historical fact. We blame the loss of the Battle of Kinsale 400 years ago on drunken Irish soldiers, although I am not sure if that is factual. We have that tradition. It is exemplified not in Ireland but in many cities outside it, in London and other cities in Britain where Irish people who are down on their luck tend to retire to the pub to drown their sorrows. It is an addiction, an affliction and an unfortunate fact of life.</P>
      <P>If we are to deregulate licences, publicans should be totally responsible for the behaviour of customers on their premises. They should be responsible for ensuring that people who are under age should not be allowed drink on their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> Public houses should also open for a limited time on Christmas Day and Good Friday. They open on those days in other countries. I do not know of a country where they do not open. Such openings do not give rise to abuse of alcohol. It comes down to publicans determining who is and who is not fit to drink on their premises. If it comes to the notice of the Garda that a person who is under age or a person who has too much drink taken has been served drink by a publican, that publican's licence should be withdrawn. It would take time to adapt to such changes, but we must adopt a more mature attitude towards drinking. At present our attitude is quite irresponsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It provides for reform of many aspects of the law relating to alcoholic drink, especially with regard to trading hours. These reforms are long overdue.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced his abortive Intoxicating Liquor Bill last year, I tabled an amendment, the effect of which would have been to extend opening hours to 12.30 a.m. every night, summer and winter. This Bill does not go that far, but it is a vast improvement on the current situation.</P>
      <P>As I said during the debate on the previous Bill, we need to deal honestly with the reality of drinking habits in Ireland today. We need to treat people as adults and offer our tourist visitors the opportunity to experience Irish hospitality. The Bill's provisions on trading hours achieve that.</P>
      <P>Many people are genuinely concerned about the possible ill-effects of extended opening hours. We need to take on board those concerns. They arise from an awareness of the widespread abuse of alcohol and from knowledge of the high levels of alcoholism in this country and its terrible effects on people with an addiction and on those around them.</P>
      <P>This is a complex issue. There is not a simplistic direct relation between hours of opening and the incidence of alcoholism. The liberalisation in the Bill is necessary. It is also necessary to adopt a more determined approach to the issue of alcoholism and its treatment. This is our most serious drug problem, yet it gets only a fraction of the attention it deserves. The provision for treatment and rehabilitation is inadequate and it is a pity parallel legislation was not brought forward to deal with this issue. The saturation advertising of alcohol also needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that many of the existing laws relating to drinking hours and other aspects of the licensed trade are honoured more in the breach than in the observance. The need for our society to deal responsibly with the question of alcohol consumption is ill-served by the yawning gap between legislation and reality. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the regulation of licensed clubs. Such clubs are an integral part of community life in urban and rural areas throughout the country. The Bill maintains unnecessary restrictions on such clubs, restrictions that in most <Col N="541" /> cases are not enforced. The requirement for all patrons other than members to sign in individually and to be effectively chaperoned by a club member is widely disregarded and should be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>The Bill further tightens restrictions whereby clubs would not be able to host private functions other than those for a club member. That would deprive many clubs of badly needed revenue. Many of those are the same clubs that appeal every year for funding under the sports capital programme, yet that provision would curb their ability to supplement their funds by hosting birthday parties, christenings, retirement parties and so on. Surely what is needed is a liberalisation of the law so that private functions and fundraising functions for local organisations can be allowed in clubs with patrons free to attend as they would other venues. I welcome the provisions of the Bill subject to the concerns I expressed which need to be addressed.</P>

      <P>The Bill introduced by the Minister is the first attempt made in many years to regularise our drinking hours and drinking habits. It is important that we consider the Bill in that context. I am in favour of the proposed changes in pub closing times. People who claim no controls should apply to pub opening times are not living in the real world. While it may be fashionable on the Continent not to regulate pub opening hours, the Irish public would prefer and expect such controls to apply.</P>
      <P>There are two provisions in the Bill which might not come to the fore but which are important to a number of people. They relate to the changes in relation to restricted licences that will allow people to regularise a situation that has been allowed to continue to operate for quite a number of years where some have been trading without a full liquor licence.</P>
      <P>We have to look at public houses in two contexts. The rural family pub is disappearing rapidly mainly due to the effect of competition and because people could not afford to carry out the necessary renovations to bring them up to standard. What has happened in the past ten years is that in villages where there were four or five pubs a couple of the licences have been sold. In the city many of the licences were used for new hotels. I hope there will not be a further decrease in the number of rural pubs as people in rural areas would prefer to drink locally than to travel five or six miles to a town. We are all aware that drinking and driving is not an acceptable pastime, especially among young people. They should be complimented on the fact that when they drink they rarely drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education has been mentioned in the context of the Bill. The dangers of alcohol should be fully <Col N="542" /> explained to pupils at second level. Education could lead to the prevention of many problems associated with under age drinking, in later life. There is also the problem that it is difficult for a publican to establish the age of some of our teenagers as many look much older than they are. The penalty proposed for those who break the law on under age drinking may need to be dealt with cautiously unless there is a proper ID system. A proper ID system could solve many of the problems of under age drinking. It would make sense if it were mandatory to produce an ID in a pub. Where a person is found to be 17 years and 11 months or 18 years less a day they may have to be dealt with in a flexible manner.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on deciding to deal with the licensing hours. We have been lobbied by publicans, disco owners and so on for the past 18 months. The Minister has been consistent in his approach. He said he would treat each section of the drinks industry fairly and he has done so. I will make one suggestion in regard to new licences. Where the population justifies it, the licence should be issued rather than have single pubs serve large areas, especially in and around the city. There are pubs in this city with a catchment area almost as big as the county from which I come. There are pubs with a catchment of 25,000 people. That is not in the best interests of the publican concerned or the people in the area. At some future time that is something that should be looked at in the context of planning. Many Dublin Deputies are concerned that frequently the pub is in the middle of an estate rather than on the fringes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I welcome also that the Minister has taken action to deal with the licensing hours. It is said that in rural areas there is no great regard given to drinking hours. We are all aware that rural pubs have had a tradition of staying open later than pubs in Dublin and that the Garda has not made a rule of interfering. This is an indication of how well the pubs were run in many cases. Publicans have a duty to protect their customers. I hope some future legislation will put an onus on publicans to safeguard those who may be intoxicated and on their premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious there is broad agreement on this Bill among various bodies and that there was much consultation and work done in advance. In this I include the committee, of which Deputy Flanagan is chairman, which did much work in teasing out the issue and getting a consensus. It is a complicated issue in that it has many vested interests &ndash; the publicans, hoteliers, restaurateurs etc. If I compare it, and probably contradict myself, with the taxi issue in Dublin, with which I was involved, we were told to take on or take out the vested interests and to think of the consumer. Yet nearly every speaker, including myself, has mentioned the vested interests. It is obvious this is not the time to take them on or take them out. Given the numbers it <Col N="543" /> would be a juggling feat to get a certain balance among them.</P>
      <P>The licensing laws are strange. I was secretary of a sports club for seven or eight years and dealt with the licensing laws from the club's point of view. It has struck me that there is one law for the city and one law for the country and I may have enjoyed that when I was down the country on my holidays. Even within an area, it often appears there is one law for one pub or club and a different law for another. When the Bill is enacted I hope it will be enforced in a fair and even-handed manner. In the past there were differences in the degree to which the law was enforced.</P>
      <P>The proposed changes reflect the changes in society and that the trade has ignored the law and pushed out the bounds of what was possible. We are all friendly with publicans and have clinics in pubs and so on. While publicans are law-abiding in respect of house rules, often they do not give a damn about the rules of the land. Dare one break a house rule and one will be out on one's ear. It is sacred not to break a house rule. I hope, following these concessions, that all sides will respect the new law and that the Garda will enforce it in a fair and even-handed way.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the new closing hours. There are three different closing times. The closing time of 11 p.m. on a Sunday night is late enough. It is not like any other day of the week where people rush in after work for a few pints. People have all day to drink on a Sunday and if they have not had enough by 11 p.m. maybe they need to be locked out. In Dublin people have to get up on Monday morning. Many need a week's rest rather than a half hour's rest after the exertions of the weekend.</P>
      <P>I have one concern about the situation in Dublin. I do not care whether people drink until 5 a.m. in Temple Bar or even on the main streets, or in Howth or Bray etc. In my area a number of pubs are slap bang in the middle of residential areas. If they do not close until 1 a.m. or 1.30 a.m. that will have an impact on local residents. That is a matter for which publicans will have to take responsibility. They will have to run a good shop inside the pub and be responsible for what happens outside. Otherwise the courts and the Garda will have to lay down new standards. I have in mind a couple of pubs which will cause absolute havoc given that elderly people live near them and many others who live nearby have to get up for work in the morning. None of us is as nice or as quiet after a few drinks as we are during the rest of the day. The Minister might clarify whether the courts will have the freedom to order a pub to close at 11 o'clock or 11.30 p.m. if the later closing time creates problems outside. The publican must be held responsible if that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some pubs in Dublin are enormous. I am therefore glad that extra licences will be trans<Col N="544" /> ferred into Dublin. I would like to see a sizeable number transferred because some existing pubs are huge and create tremendous problems. I am concerned about what these licences will cost. Could the Minister tell the House what he considers reasonable? Taxi licences, from having a nominal value, acquired a value which was never thought of. I would like the Minister to put this Bill in context and say what his understanding is, whether it would be acceptable for these licences to be sold for £25,000, £50,000 or £100,000. I would like the Minister to decide on a context so that if, in five or ten years' time, licences are priced at £500,000, we can say that is wrong and out of context.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments on under age drinking and temporary or early closures. These should apply to pubs that create a problem outside. I hope there will be enforcement. Nobody is fussy about somebody who is 17 years and 11 months old drinking a pint of shandy. One does not suddenly become sensible on one's eighteenth birthday. However, we all know of pubs where 14 and 15 year olds are being served not just one pint of shandy but spirits week after week. There is no doubt that laxity has crept into the whole system and it is necessary to clamp down.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that pubs will have to close at 11.30 p.m. on Holy Thursday. That is a night when many go out to drink as if it were going out of fashion because they cannot cope with the thought of one dry day. I am aware that it overlaps into Good Friday morning, but I would have thought that was one night pubs would be allowed to stay open late, because that is a night when people tend to go bonkers anyway.</P>

      <P>Having had a reckless youth, I am becoming rather more mature and sensible in my old age. I commend the Minister and his officials for producing this Bill. It is pragmatic rather than being overly infused with the moral dicta of a previous age. It is no secret that the legislation on intoxicating liquor, gambling and other such areas is rooted in the Victorian era when it was more important to be seen to be doing the right thing than to actually do it. The Minister is doing the right thing in introducing this legislation. He is not cloaking his arguments in favour of this legislation in an overly moralistic framework. That is important because unfortunately &ndash; or fortunately, depending on how one looks at it &ndash; alcohol and all these other distractions in life are with us and will be for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish, in the time available, to concentrate on three distinct topics, first, the supply of alcohol to <Col N="545" /> under age drinkers, drinking in public places and the position of GAA, rugby, golf and other clubs under this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are other major positive features and measures included in this Bill. The provisions are intended to curb the phenomenon of under age drinking which has become such a regrettable feature of our society. This is one of the problems of prosperity which now face us. Previous generations simply did not have the disposable income to engage in serious drinking as young teenagers. This is brought home to anybody that cares to ask a serious question of their own parents or grandparents. They simply did not have the money in their pockets to do the kinds of things young people have the money to do today. Nowadays with widespread affluence, ready pocket money, widely available part-time employment and ready access to alcohol, there has been a huge increase in teenage drinking and drunkenness in all communities. This has contributed to a variety of anti-social activities, criminal behaviour and disregard for the public good.</P>
    <P>The abolition in this Bill of the legal anomaly, the so-called &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence, which has made it inordinately difficult for the Garda to secure convictions against licensees or publicans &ndash; who are a minority in any community &ndash; who persistently sell alcoholic beverages to under age people, either on or off their premises, will be radically changed in the context of this Bill. The law enforcement agencies will have a very strong enforcement measure against those publicans who wilfully sell alcohol to people who are below the legal age for consuming it. For the first time it will an offence of strict liability. There will be no acceptable defence to the selling of alcohol to minors and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>We often try to fool ourselves &ndash; and the people who promote tourism here are as guilty as many others &ndash; that this country is a wonderful place where one can have a drink and so on. However, there is a very strong minority of people who do not drink; there is a very strong temperance movement. There is also very great concern on the part of the Garda Síochána about the kind of lawlessness and disorder that is associated with the opening of pubs and the effect it has on the community because of the opening hours and so on. It is important to keep that in context. While we are fabled and renowned the world over as a nation of drinkers, there is a significant minority of people &ndash; I do not know the percentage &ndash; who do not touch alcohol. Their wishes must be considered in legislating for the availability of alcohol, pub opening hours, the type of licensing and the social controls that will apply.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is one of the best Ministers for Justice this House has ever had, has made a unique contribution in this regard. He has not pursued an excessively zealous moral agenda, nor has he expressed an excessively lax <Col N="546" /> or liberal view in relation to these provisions. The scaremongering that is going on in relation to clubs and societies is wrong and the Minister has rightly rebutted that. This is a fabulous piece of legislation. It is not the end of the Irish alcohol question. It is only the beginning. It is like a long night in a pub. There is much further discussion to be done. The Minister has rightly appointed a commission to look into the other vexatious issues that will, of necessity, arise from this legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the legislation which has been awaited for quite some time. We had the abortive attempt on the Minister's part last year when he tried to introduce a botched measure. It did not survive his own backbench revolt. The rumour around the House is that Deputy Healy-Rae and others have been kept under wraps for this evening so the Bill is probably assured passage at Second Stage.</P>
      <P>A number of issues that arose in the context of the debate on this issue over the past number of years have not been included in the Bill. While I welcome the sections in the Bill, I will concentrate on issues that have been ignored in the hope that the Minister might be prevailed upon to introduce appropriate amendments on Committee Stage. He does not need to be reminded of the 75 recommendations of the sub-committee that sat over a long period and dealt with important matters, many of which have been ignored.</P>
      <P>Under Part 4 the Minister is unduly restrictive in the manner in which he allows for a relaxation in the law on the issuing of new licences. It is extraordinary and, indeed, unnecessary that one must enact new legislation for the granting of a new retail on licence to new outlets. A mechanism should be devised to allow for the issue of intoxicating liquor licences to heritage interpretative centres, <i>bona fide</i> museums, theatres, cultural centres, galleries, outdoor sports stadia and recreational centres where the consumption of alcohol would be secondary to the main pursuit for which the building is best noted. It is disappointing that the Minister has ignored that aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In that event we look forward to detailed ministerial amendments on Committee Stage. The Minister will be aware of the practice, particularly in rural areas, of having a drink after Sunday morning Mass. A general application must be made to bring forward the opening hours to 12 o'clock. I understand the legislation does not deal with this aspect and a general application will have to made to the court on an annual basis. <Col N="547" /> I would have thought this matter would have been addressed by way of a practical amendment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measures on six day licences. The amount of money involved is considerably higher than that which obtained on a previous occasion. I regret that there is no definition of a night club. That will cause problems. I accept it is a complex issue but I hope it can be addressed in the context of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not concern himself with the price of drink but he might deal with that in the context of his relationship, if any, with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The price of drink is too high. There is a cartel in operation which the Minister is ensuring will continue to operate given the restrictive licensing code. The price of soft drinks should be the subject of an inquiry.</P>
      <P>The sale of beer in restaurants has been tackled and I welcome section 22. However, the unduly restrictive nature of that section is underlined by the fact that people can be fined £1,000 for having a drink if they do not do so at the same time as they are eating. What have we come to if a person can be fined £1,000 for buying a drink in a restaurant after they have eaten there? It is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>There has been public debate on sections 25 and 26 and I leave it to the Minister to rebut many of the arguments concerning clubs, their members and signing the book. Rather than reaffirm the law in this matter I would have expected the Minister to relax it. These are weird and impractical provisions.</P>
      <P>As regards the sale of beer in shops, particularly independent grocery chains that do not have a full wine, beer and spirits off-licence but a retail wine licence, there is a strong argument in favour of having a mechanism that would allow for the sale of beer. Perhaps the wine licence could be accompanied by a beer retailer's licence. If one can sell wine freely in a grocery outlet the argument in favour of selling beer is overwhelming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers who referred to the &ldquo;super pubs&rdquo;, the barn-like emporiums that we have seen destroy an Irish tradition in pubs. The reason for them is the distribution of the licences. We must move away from such structures. With regard to the technical nature of the licence, we must separate a hotel licence from a seven day publican's licence. If one inspects the licence register in a District Court office one will see there is not any colour coding, the language is unclear and it is impossible to distinguish between the two types of licence. The licences should be colour coded. I am not sure whether this can be done by way of regulation but I am disappointed the Minister has not addressed this matter in the Bill. Many court registers do not accurately reflect the nature of the licence for the particular area. Many hotel owners are under the mistaken impression that they hold seven day <Col N="548" /> licences. There is no obvious way to tell from an inspection whether it is a hotel or pub licence.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether section 6 of the 1902 Act, as amended by section 24 of the 1960 Act, applies to a hotel extension or whether one should apply for a new hotel licence. I regret I do not have more time at my disposal but I will deal with these issues further on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for sharing his time. I wish to share time with Deputy Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>. The social aspect of a public house is very important, particularly in rural Ireland. We are all aware of the outcry that ensued when the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, tried to reduce the permitted alcohol limit for the purposes of road safety legislation. Our constituents found it difficult to understand how it could be reduced to a mere pint. That was subsequently amended by the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left coalition Government in 1995.</P>
      <P>The question of alcohol consumption always generates heat. This Bill will also generate much debate and opinion depending on what sector is involved. Whether one is a rural or Dublin based publican, one will have different views. We must control the level of alcohol people can consume, particularly young people. I support the concept of compulsory ID. Under-age drinking is a great worry. It is drug abuse and is carried on in the context of social activities, many of which centre around alcohol.</P>
      <P>The alternatives to drink are few and far between. Some years ago in Kilkenny a number of people, including Mr. Eddie Keher and Fr. Tommy Murphy, established the No Name Club which afforded young people the opportunity to enjoy themselves without resort to drink. It was not funded by the State as a youth activity to the extent that it is now. The Government should examine the funding available to youth activities, particularly those which do not involve the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Organisations such as the No Name Club should attract extended funding to provide a meaningful alternative for youth activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the level of involvement and partnership that publicans and clubs have engaged in over the years in Kilkenny city in funding various commercial activities and festivals as well as artistic and sporting events. The partnership between pubs and clubs has worked well. The legislation will put down a demarcation line and will upset that partnership. Clubs will be forced to take radical action to comply with the legislation by signing on people for birthday parties or community events. The Minister should reduce this demarcation line and confirm the existing partnership in a more meaningful way by not providing for such harsh fines or regulations attached to club activities. The quality of premises in Kilkenny, which depends a lot on tourism and festival events, is unequalled in the country, as is the level of service and hygiene. Vintners, clubs, societies and other organisations have <Col N="549" /> come together in a major show of goodwill for the community there. The Minister could be undermining that partnership, however, in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Not enough licences are easily available for growing urban areas and that problem is not confined to Dublin. In many parts of my constituency, in particular Kilkenny city where sprawling housing estates are developing, it is not easy to establish a new public house. The vintners' organisation is looking after its existing members but it could be a bit more flexible instead of seeking a rigid and restrictive attitude towards the granting of new pub licences. The normal cost of a licence in rural areas is £110,000 which is an expensive process to permit a new public house to be established.</P>
    <P>The inconsistency of drink prices is not addressed in the Bill. Since the abolition of restrictive practices we have seen indiscriminate increases in drink prices without any legislative mechanism to restrict them. The Minister should examine the issue of uniform opening hours, rather than having three different opening hours. I was amused to see that under section 19 the sale of drink will not be allowed at an auction or sale. We will have many a good auction or sale with the flexibility the Minister is inserting in this section of the Bill. I do not know where the demand came from.</P>

        <b>:</b> People who commit crimes of assault because they have taken too much alcoholic drink should be banned from drinking alcohol for 12 months rather than being fined in court. If a person has a firearms licence and abuses that privilege, the gardaí will confiscate the gun. Likewise, if someone has a car and drives recklessly and dangerously they can be put off the road. It is time that those who cannot have alcohol without being aggressive and thuggish were banned from having drink by the courts. While the implementation of this procedure might be difficult it would be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can all see what happens when these people, who have no sense of responsibility, start to perform under the influence of drink. A few weeks ago I was returning from a long journey when a crowd of people came out of a pub across the street forcing us to stop the car. We were stuck in the middle of a row at 8 o'clock on a Sunday evening, which had nothing to do with late closing hours. The drunken thugs damaged <Col N="550" /> the wing of the car by falling against it. A lout stood in front of the car and told my daughter, who was driving, to &ldquo;f&rdquo;&ndash; off up the street, even though we were four decent citizens minding our own business. Just because he was full of drink he thought he was free to act in such a manner. He should be banned from drinking alcohol because he has no sense of responsibility. Likewise, people who travelled on the train from Cork after Tipperary's great victory over Waterford were terrorised by a few people who thought they could wreck everybody else's journey because they had taken drink. These people should be banned from having alcohol because they cannot carry drink.</P>
    <P>Many people have different views about selling drink to underage persons. The onus should be on young drinkers themselves to prove that they are aged 18 or over. It is asking the impossible to expect a publican to recognise whether a young person is under 18. As a former teacher, I have often been flabbergasted to see how some of my former pupils could get drink even though they were under 18. On one occasion in a local club I saw one of the under-16 footballers, who looked much older than that, drinking orange and vodka. He wanted me to smell the orange to prove that he only had a soft drink, but I had to remind him that I had been out before. It is impossible for publicans to know whether young people are under age. I have no time for any publican who would deliberately sell drink to underage persons and I would support the idea of closing them down for a week for doing so. In addition, so-called responsible adults who buy drink for underage persons in their company should also be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>One would need the wisdom of Solomon to guess young people's ages. There is no identity card system and we should introduce one. Otherwise, it is asking too much of so many decent publicans who are family people themselves and would not want their own children to get drink. The onus of the offence should fall on young drinkers themselves who should not put people in difficulty by buying drink in a pub. The Minister should examine that matter because without identity cards for young people a publican is placed in an impossible position to judge.</P>
    <P>We all received a submission from the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, which is a sensible document. The association asked us to have a sense of responsibility. Some people become happy when they have a few drinks and may sing a song, provided they can sing before they drink because drink does not make singers out of crows. Much good happens when people get a few drinks, but the thugs should be banned from all licensed premises.</P>
    <P>In future if the Minister is granting new licences from scratch they should only have the value of allowing the licensee to sell alcohol. It is absurd that such licences should grow in value. If somebody wishes to cease selling drink, that should be the end of the matter. One cannot <Col N="551" /> make legislation retroactive because people have paid colossal sums of money and they have rights. However, any licences granted in future should only be to sell drink, not to sell the licence itself.</P>
    <P>Last night I paid £3.15 for a drink which normally costs £1.80. The people who sell the drink for £1.80 are making a profit so what is happening with those who charged me £3.15 in Dublin last night? I am delighted that agricultural shows, as distinct from auctions, can have a licence. Tullow show always had a problem because the publican had to close his shop in order to sell drink there. It was a complicated system of transferring the licence, so the new provision is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As a member of Deputy Flanagan's wonderful committee that sat listening to all kinds of argument for and against the extension of closing time, I must say the Minister would need the wisdom of Solomon in dealing with this subject. The committee heard people who argued for the closure of pubs at 10 o'clock at night, while others came in immediately afterwards and argued that pubs should be open all night. It is difficult to strike the correct balance. It is important that the people who use these public houses have a responsibility in that regard. If a person cannot drink and be a better person, then they should not drink at all. The idea that a solicitor can make a plea in court that a person was under the influence of drink is wrong. He or she should have their sentence doubled because if they cannot behave themselves when they drink, they should not drink at all. Some judges might tell them to go on an alcohol abuse course. It should be mandatory that these people are barred from pubs because they injure people.</P>

      <P>This debate provides an opportunity to discuss the broader implications of drink but I would first like to compliment the Minister. After many years of discussion and debate, we finally have legislation which goes a long way towards addressing the majority view. The majority of people would have expressed the opinion that the licensing hours were too restrictive, but we need a system in place where there are at least some rules with regard to the closing of licensed premises. People might quote the European context and say that in some European countries there is no mechanism whereby a pub has to close at a certain hour, but there is a different attitude to drink in those countries. They are not the hub of social activity that we would associate with the traditional Irish pub and the drinking habits of the Irish people. It is disingenuous of those people to suggest we should have a very liberal system and equate it to some of the European countries which have a completely different culture and attitude to drinking in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has been going on for many years. There has been much broadly based consultation with various interested groups. A committee was set up to discuss licensing hours and the issuing <Col N="552" /> of licences and the Bill goes a long way towards addressing the consensus that was almost reached with regard to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Because we are a tourist dependent country, the pub closure on Sunday afternoon, known in rural Ireland as the holy hour, impinged greatly on the whole pub food sector. The fact that it is now being abolished is welcome because it will allow pubs throughout the country to provide a proper food service for tourists and their own patrons alike. That is a positive step.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on acknowledging that there is a sector of people who do not want to go to nightclubs. They want to stay out that extra hour until 12.30 a.m. with their friends and have a few jars and a social evening. In the past, if people wanted a few late drinks they were obliged to go to the local nightclub or dance hall, pay £5 or £7 to get in and then pay what I would deem to be excessive prices for the drink sold there and to listen to loud music. I did that for many years but as the years move on one is less inclined to go to these places. The closing time of 12.30 a.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays is very welcome.</P>
    <P>There is much reference in the Bill to under age drinking. While I know this Bill is not the legislative implementation process to address the issue of under age drinking, it affords us an opportunity to have a debate on the problem. Under age drinking is the biggest social scourge facing Irish society. Under age drinking is an alarming phenomenon in every part of the country and if we do not address the problem in some way we will be going down a very slippery road.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, when public representatives and others highlighted the heroin problem, people said we did not have a problem or that only a very small number of people were using the drug. After the ostrich syndrome ended and we took our heads out of the sand, we acknowledged that we had an enormous problem and we are only now addressing it. That is the case with the problem of under age drinking. It has to be tackled in a serious way.</P>
    <P>Other public representatives, particularly those who represent large cities and towns, have told me that on Friday and Saturday nights they are almost no go areas because of hoards of young people highly intoxicated on alcohol and, more likely, on some other substance as well. The drinking culture, which involves young people buying copious amounts of drink from off-licences, gathering in large groups and indulging in large amounts of drink, is a threat to the whole fabric of society.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we should examine the idea of introducing an identity card system. We are a mature society. The civil liberties crowd claim it would be an infringement on a person's civil liberties if they were obliged to carry an ID card but we have to remember that on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights in some areas many people are unable to walk the public highways because they are so fearful of these large gangs of young <Col N="553" /> people who gather to drink and who cause all sorts of problems. We have public order Acts and other forms of legislation to tackle the end result but so far we have not addressed the source of the problem. If we introduced an ID card system it could go a long way to addressing that particular problem.</P>
    <P>I was in Boston last year on holiday. Outside every pub in Boston there is a person at the door and if someone is unable to produce a driving licence, or a passport in the case of a non-national &ndash; United States citizens would show their national security card &ndash; they cannot enter the premises. There is a good reason for that. If the police enter the premises and someone does not have valid ID, it is the licensee who is prosecuted. We have to consider introducing such a system. The civil liberties groups must acknowledge there is a major problem which has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the price of drink. There is a problem here as well. It is amazing that one can travel the length and breadth of the country and there can be a difference of £1 in the price of a drink. That is a problem we must address because it is creating inflationary pressures but, more importantly, it is not fair that a person who stops off at a pub has to first look at the price list on the door. People do not normally do that. They call in for a drink, the drink is put on the counter but they are charged over and above what we would consider a reasonable price. I am not advocating that we bring back restrictive practices but it should be acknowledged that there is a problem of excessive charging in the drinks industry, particularly in the Dublin area. Some pubs charge incredible prices for drinks, particularly the mixers for spirits.</P>
    <P>People on both sides of the argument will say that a liberal view should be taken of licences and that they should be issued without any restrictions other than the fact that one must have a suitable premises and that it would be available to sell alcohol. That is going a step too far. Many family run pubs have invested large sums of money over many years. It is their source of income and their way of life, and if we were to undermine that we would undermine the basic idea of the Irish rural pub which would have a knock-on effect in terms of tourism, etc. The Minister has struck a fair balance in that regard. He should be commended on that.</P>
    <P>There has been a major improvement in the quality of Irish pubs in recent years, particularly in regard to food. However, there is still a difficulty in some areas with regard to hygiene standards, particularly the toilets and washing facilities in public houses. This is a very serious issue. We are giving public houses the freedom to trade for longer hours and we use the Irish pub as a mechanism to attract tourists. It is important to not only enforce licensing hours but to uphold hygiene standards and the quality afforded to patrons. That should be addressed, if not in this Bill, by the health boards or the hygiene authorities. We must encourage and, if necessary, <Col N="554" /> force people to address this. People who flout hygiene regulations and do not provide proper washing and toilet facilities should be fined or closed down until they get their house in order.</P>
    <P>I will not go through the Bill in detail. I know many people will want to express opinions on it again on Report Stage. I compliment the Minister. The extension of the licensing hours is very welcome. It is accepted that many people have a few extra drinks on Thursday nights. Many people who work in Dublin go out with their friends on Thursday nights because they travel home on Fridays. Thursday is a popular night for going out, particularly in large urban areas. It is very welcome that the closing time on Thursday nights will now be 12.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in regard to absenteeism, but I think they are diminishing. Somebody said to me that people drank in the 1980s because they were depressed and in the 1990s because they were celebrating. That is a factor. The level of absenteeism due to alcohol has diminished somewhat over the years, but it is still a problem and we need to be conscious of it. The licensing hours that have been outlined acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill a speedy passage. The Minister might seek to stimulate a debate on the identity card concept. There is a large problem with an element in the off-licence trade that will serve drink to almost anybody. In addition, third parties purchase large amounts of drink in off-licences and distribute it to younger people who take it to parties, which creates problems. At the end of the day, it is up to individuals to be responsible. However, as a society and as a Government we have a duty to ensure we minimise the access of young people to drink, particularly in the off-licence sector and some public houses.</P>
    <P>There was an issue in the Bill which some people felt was contentious. However, I believe that if publicans are unsure of a person's age, they should err on the side of caution and not serve them, or at least ask for some positive identification, rather than saying afterwards that the person looked 19 years old because he was tall and very broad. That is unacceptable in this day and age. I compliment the Minister for taking tough action and sending out a signal that we are addressing the difficulties of under-age drinking. However, I hope he will go a few steps further in regard to the identification card system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the 42 Deputies who contributed to this most interesting debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000. It was to be expected that the Bill would generate a great deal of interest on both sides of the House. I am truly grateful to all the Deputies who made contributions because they reflected the reaction to the legislation in the wider community in a democratic fashion, which is what this House is all about. I am also gratified by the positive reception the Bill has received, in general terms, in the House and outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> In essence, the Bill achieves what I set out to achieve under two years ago, and which I described in my opening remarks, that is, to introduce a system of permitted hours in line with public expectation and demand, on terms that are socially and economically acceptable, to sweep away restrictive legislation governing access to the market, without undermining the economic basis which obtains for the holders of licences and to put in place innovative, workable and strict penalties against those who engage in the criminally irresponsible practice of selling or supplying intoxicating liquor to under-age persons. The licensing laws must be seen as a system of balances that is responsive to the needs and demands of today's consumer and marketplace, but that also ensures that our social responsibilities, including responsibility for health, public order and protection of the vulnerable, particularly the young, are not weakened or cast aside. That is the balance I have sought to ensure in this legislation.</P>
    <P>No one can argue that the Bill does not contain genuine and much needed reform to meet the needs and expectations of a modern society. Deputies have, for the most part, recognised this in the important comments they made on the Bill and on the need to change the law to reflect the society in which we live. It is equally important that the Bill contains a social conscience and that it does not do away with those vital elements that protect society. It is my contention that the Bill achieves that radical transformation of the licensing scene, that it does so with the minimum fuss, without adding to the burden of regulation that has been a long-standing feature of the licensing code and that it does not lose sight of the fact that alcohol is a drug, to be handled with care and from which we must also protect the young and the vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I have undertaken that the commission on licensing will examine other aspects of the licensing code, including a review of the scope for a system of additional licences and, indeed, the nature of premises that could be licensed. In that respect, I clearly acknowledge that more needs to be done. However, I think it is plain to see in the Bill a full measure, if I may be permitted at least one pun, of my bona fides as far as reform of the law in this area is concerned. I am in favour of changing many aspects of our intoxicating liquor law. There is no doubt that, from the perspective of social legislation, this is an area of the law which demands to be reviewed from time to time and appropriate changes made. It is also an area of the law which is highly complex and which, to say the very least, has the capacity to be very controversial.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the issue of under-age drinking. I appreciate the support for the provisions in the Bill in relation to that matter. I made a deliberate and particular effort in the Bill to ensure the protection of young people and to make such protection as effective as possible. In addition to the provisions contained in the Intoxi<Col N="556" /> cating Liquor Act, 1988, the new provisions introduced by this Bill will significantly improve on the situation, in that they are designed to tackle head on those who engage in the criminally irresponsible practice of supplying alcohol to young people. As I have said on many other occasions, the vast majority of licence holders have nothing to fear from these provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to the age card scheme and queried its application. Regulations to provide for the introduction of a national voluntary age card scheme came into effect on 19 April 1999. The number of cards being issued by the Garda is increasing steadily, from just over 7,000 at the end of March this year, to the present figure of some 9,250 cards. I believe that the scheme will help to provide an effective deterrent against under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the substantial changes provided for in the Bill to deal with underage drinking, particularly the removal of the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence in any proceedings against a licensee, a greater onus is placed on the licensee of a licensed premises to ensure that intoxicating liquor is supplied only to those who are legally entitled to purchase it or consume it on licensed premises. The removal of the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence is complementary to the voluntary age card scheme and will serve to make reliance on it by licensees more important, because no defence will be permitted where a person wilfully supplies liquor to an under-age person.I make no apology that these provisions are tough. They must be tough if they are to contribute effectively and not be just mere window dressing to our attack on under age drinking. In this context, many thousands of parents of young teenagers feel particularly vulnerable to the danger of under age drinking in our society. One only has to look at the night of junior certificate results in the towns, villages and cities to realise their fear is a grounded one. It is incumbent on the House to ensure provisions are brought forward which will tackle this problem in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>That is not to say it would be fair to impose an obligation on the licensee which could not be met by him or her. Cards will be available to young people over the age of 18. I would strongly encourage young people who wish to visit a licensed premises and consume alcohol and who are over the age of 18 to obtain these cards. In the future, it will be the position that licensees will expect the cards to be produced if they have a doubt regarding a young person's age. This is because the offence of serving under age persons will be an offence of strict liability.</P>
    <P>There have been many important contributions to this legislation, not least of which has come from the Oireachtas committee which considered the licensing laws over a long period. It would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge the lasting and meaningful contribution which the committee made towards the drafting of this legislation. I am also grateful to all Members of the House. <Col N="557" /> It is sometimes forgotten that those who come under the most pressure when legislation like this is introduced are the Independent Deputies who support the Government. I publicly thank the Independents for their support for this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also true to say that it is important from many perspectives that the new age card for young people is promoted in a proper fashion. In deference to the Independent Deputies and others who have mentioned it to me, there will be a major public awareness campaign in relation to the availability of the cards so that young people will know what is expected of them if there is a doubt regarding their age. In addition, it is only fair to the licensees that this should be the case.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion to the effect that we were merely tinkering around with these licensing laws. This is a political charge that can be taken with a grain of salt because, in truth, there is hardly a section of this Bill that does not introduce important changes in the law. The Bill provides a framework within which responsible people can enjoy a drink in convivial surroundings if that is what they desire. We must acknowledge that the majority of people exercise a responsible attitude to drink, otherwise we should legislate for greater restrictions on the use of alcohol. I agree with Deputies who have provided examples of the dangers of alcohol abuse. However, the problems associated with alcohol abuse cannot be solved by legislation alone. It has been said many times that one cannot legislate for people to be good, no more than one can legislate for people to be bad.</P>
      <P>The real challenge is in changing attitudes to alcohol. We know this is an extremely difficult task to accomplish but not impossible. Public intolerance of drinking and driving shows what can be done through constantly making people aware of the unacceptable consequences of driving and drinking. Parents can deliver a very clear message to their children about the evils of under age drinking and the dangers of alcohol abuse but the impact of the message is greatly diminished if the parents themselves do not have a responsible attitude towards the use of alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people will agree that it is remarkable that there does not exist any requirement on licence holders to display a notice to the effect that it is illegal to sell or supply liquor to under age persons, or that it is an offence for a young person to seek to obtain alcohol in a licensed premises. It would be a useful reminder to licence holders and young people alike if such a notice were to be displayed prominently. In that context, I regard it as necessary that such notices would be displayed in any place where alcohol is supplied. On Committee Stage I will, therefore, introduce an amendment to Part III of the Bill <Col N="558" /> relating to under age provisions to provide for such a notice.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment about registered clubs. Private clubs, registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts, provide opportunities for people to socialise. I am concerned, however, that registered clubs should, for the purpose of tackling the problem of under age drinking, be brought within the same regime in relation to offences for under age drinking as they apply to licensed premises. Regarding access to club premises, I remind commentators on this debate that a registered club is not the same as a licensed premises with a seven day licence. There is a difference. Far from interfering in a restrictive way with present law regarding registered clubs, I am proposing that rather than carry on with the rule &ndash; some might even call it a farce &ndash; whereby each guest invited from a visiting group or team has to sign his or her name and address, in the future the member would sign in the entire group.</P>
    <P>I must resist the calls to liberalise the situation to the extent that to all intents and purposes, a registered club would have precisely the same rights as an ordinary licensed premises. If I were to do that in relation to registered clubs, other sectors of society involved in other commercial activities would have every right to make precisely the same argument. I have outlined on a number of occasions why I am opposed to total deregulation because I have always been firmly of the view that we are not comparing like with like when we compare groceries with alcohol. Alcohol is a mind altering substance and to the best of my knowledge, unless one has been invented recently, groceries do not alter the mind in the same way.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions to the effect that the measures are too restrictive and also suggestions that they are too liberal. I am pleased that I have reached the middle ground in this debate. If I have succeeded in doing so, the Bill will be a success. We have reached a point in our social development when we can dispense with some of the paranoia surrounding the consumption of alcohol, which is a throwback to a bygone age. As I stated on numerous occasions, I have met many interest groups.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this is a genuinely reforming measure and one that represents a number of balances. I am glad I have been able to achieve a balance in particular between those advocating no change in the law as it stands and those who see any regulation of this areas as the personification of the nanny state.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their useful and positive contributions. I acknowledge the courtesy of the main Opposition spokespersons in being present for my closing contribution. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this item and I thank the Minister for coming to the House himself to reply to it. This matter is one that will be of serious concern to all those who value the safety of the food we eat and is a matter that calls for full and immediate answers from the Government, the Environmental Protection Agency and those promoting the greater use of genetically modified organisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it emerged two weeks ago that a significant consignment of rapeseed, originating in Canada and which had been contaminated with the GM variety of the crop, had been planted across in Europe and had been distributed across 600 farms and planted in 30,000 acres in the UK, there was a general sigh of relief that Ireland appeared to have escaped on this occasion. Despite the reassuring noises from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the company behind the rapeseed, Advanta, that Ireland had no reason to worry, it now emerges that a consignment of contaminated seed <Col N="560" /> had made its way to Ireland, was planted here, harvested, fed to animals and has in all likelihood found its way into the human food chain. What is more, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which has overall responsibility for food safety in Ireland actually planted the contaminated seed in its own facilities in counties Cork, Kildare and Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to answers from all concerned as to how this was allowed to happen. Consumers, who have been shown by research to be concerned by the implications of GMOs, may well have consumed food products contaminated with genetically modified organisms. While there are still issues to be resolved about GMOs and neither public or scientific opinion is unanimous on the issue, the bottom line is that nobody should be asked to consume foodstuffs without being fully aware of their contents.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that the consumer has the right to know what is in the food we buy, how it is made, where it comes from and how it has been treated. That has not happened on this occasion and even if the amounts of seed involved were reportedly very small, it is not good enough. Even at this stage the EPA is quoted today as declining to indicate the level of risk pending the completion of its investigation.</P>
    <P>This failure emphasises the need for a more coordinated approach on the part of the Irish authorities. At least four Departments and at least two Government agencies share responsibility for different aspects of the GMO issue. We clearly need better co-ordination between the Departments and agencies responsible.</P>
    <P>It is no comfort to anyone that the GMO involved had been approved for use in North America, as it had not been cleared for use in Europe or approved for use in Ireland. Many things are acceptable to consumers in North America which are not acceptable to European consumers. For instance, many farmers have gone to jail in this country for injecting their cattle with growth promoters which are quite legally available and widely used in North America. The success of our food exports has been based largely on our reputation for clean natural products and this incident can only damage that reputation.</P>
    <P>The Government must also demand from the company involved, Advanta, full details of how this consignment of rapeseed was contaminated. We are told that this happened accidentally, but it is just such accidents that proponents of GMOs told us just could not happen. Speaking in the House almost exactly 12 months ago I called for a moratorium on the production and commercial trials of GM crops in Ireland and in Europe generally to allow a space for the public and for policy makers to be better informed, to give reasoned consideration to the issues surrounding GM production and, if necessary, to put in place a satisfactory regulatory framework. This latest <Col N="561" /> incident greatly increases the case for such a moratorium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this matter and the Minister for coming in to respond to it.</P>
      <P>I echo the serious concerns following the revelations of the EPA yesterday and I am also concerned by the way this information has come to light on the use of genetically modified oilseed rape for a variety of trial purposes by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. When it was reported that 34,000 acres of contaminated seed were sown in the UK, Sweden, Germany and France, questions were immediately raised about our position. The Department of the Environment and Local Government said that no such products had been used here or had come into the Irish market. There was relief at that stage, but information has come to light which shows that statement was untrue.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue and received an answer to a parliamentary question yesterday at the same time that the EPA issued its statement, but it did not provide me with the information we now know the Minister had at that time. The Minister's reply was grossly misleading and was not forthcoming with the facts that were in the public domain at that stage. The reply stated that there was no evidence of use in this country of any GM seed varieties approved by other EU States. That is true, but he knew then that there was evidence of use of GM seed varieties that were not approved by other EU States; these varieties were approved in Canada and the United States, but the Minister chose not to place that information on the record at the time. This information has now been outlined by the EPA. The Minister's response also referred to a recent accidental spread of GM seed. The EPA has not yet finalised its investigation of this, but initial, if unconfirmed, indications are that there is no risk of the spread of this seed. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that in his response.</P>
      <P>The findings of the current EPA investigation into how this seed came to be used here and what happened to the crop are essential from a consumer point of view and I hope those findings are made public. However, many more questions have been raised that need to be answered. What procedures and practices are in place to ensure that GM seeds are not planted here? Do these need to be revised in light of recent revelations? Is it possible that other seed companies could have released batches of seed contaminated by a genetically modified product? Those questions must be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advanta, the company which supplied the contaminated product, stated that it had never sold any commercial quantities of seed to a customer in the Republic of Ireland, but it did supply stocks <Col N="562" /> which are now known to contain a trace of GMO to an Irish seed company. What company? How did the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development come to use this seed? The supply is very low &ndash; 2 kilogrammes of seed. I find it very strange that 2 kilogrammes used in 1998 can now be tracked down precisely and I look forward to the EPA investigation pointing out how that can be done. Are we sure that is all that is involved? That question must be addressed. The variety trials referred to are not covered by Directive 92/20, which controls the deliberate release of genetically modified products. This has been shown to be a gap in the system.</P>
    <P>We must revise the manner in which we control these seeds and the production of such food. As Deputy Gilmore said, there are many Departments and groups involved in this area, including the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of Health and Children to which the Food Safety Authority reports. More co-ordination and co-operation is required between these Departments if consumer confidence is to be developed.</P>
    <P>This issue is about consumer confidence, openness and transparency. It is not good enough to deal with this situation by using half truths and half answers. There must be openness and transparency and the full facts must be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. Following the recent publicity about the dissemination of genetically modified rapeseed and its cultivation in several countries of the EU, I am grateful for the opportunity to give the House up to date information on this matter and to set out its context and background.</P>
      <P>My Department carries out variety evaluation trials at the request of seed merchants on crops of agricultural importance on an annual basis by means of small scale field trials. The purpose of these trials is to test new crop varieties for potential value for cultivation and use to Irish agriculture. Successful varieties are then admitted to the national catalogue of agricultural varieties and made available to farmers for commercial planting.</P>
      <P>The affected seed &ndash; hyola 38 and hyola 401 &ndash; originated in Canada and the contamination is believed to have come about through cross pollination between two oilseed rape crops that were sown too close. The seed was sown commercially on farms in seven EU countries, covering an area exceeding 15,500 hectares. This is the latest area notified by member states to the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Oilseed rape varieties hyola 38 and hyola 401 were included in the Department's small scale <Col N="563" /> field trials in 1997 and 1998. These varieties were submitted on the basis that they were conventionally bred. The applicant company was Advanta Seeds UK which supplied 1kg of seed of each of the varieties hyola 38 and hyola 401. A total of 20 conventionally bred varieties of oilseed rape were involved in trials in each of the two years.</P>
    <P>The field trials were carried out at three centres &ndash; the Department's national crop centre at Backweston, Leixlip, County Kildare, its cereals testing station at Ballinacurra, Midleton, County Cork and Teagasc Agricultural College, Clonakilty, County Cork. In the field trials, plots of each variety were sown in four replications. Each plot size was two metres by 15 metres. Thus, the total area sown to each of the two varieties of hyola in each of the two years amounted to less than 0.04 hectares or one tenth of an acre.</P>
    <P>The varieties in the trial were presented as conventionally bred varieties and, accordingly, were treated in the normal fashion as there was no reason at the time to follow any other procedure. At the conclusion of the trials, the harvested material of the two varieties in question, with the exception of 2kgs which were retained by the Department as a sample, along with the other varieties on trial were sent to feed compounders for incorporation in animal feedstuffs. The retained sample is being made available to the EPA for appropriate analysis. The Department has not undertaken trials on genetically modified varieties and does not have any application on hand for the possible inclusion of such a variety in its trial list at present.</P>
    <P>Following the conclusion of the oilseed rape trial in 1998, the varieties were not incorporated into the national catalogue of approved varieties for commercial use. No further applications were made to the Department for either further evaluation or commercialisation of the varieties.</P>
    <P>It is a source of great concern to me that contaminated seed, whether accidental or otherwise, was submitted for the purpose of variety trial evaluation in Ireland. The Government is determined to prevent a recurrence. Accordingly, my Department is working closely with the competent authority in this matter, the EPA, on the establishment of an appropriate monitoring and control system to ensure that contaminated seed is not imported in the future.</P>
    <P>At EU level, the Commission is bringing forward legislation as a matter of urgency to address the problem at Community level. While the final provisions of the legislation are yet to be agreed, I understand they are likely to include: measures for identification of third country seed imports into the Community; agreed testing and sampling procedures; obligations on importers to ensure imports are free from contamination; procedures for dealing with contaminated crops sown acci<Col N="564" /> dentally, including provisions for destruction of such crops. I will support the Commission's proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the facts and information I have given and the steps being taken will clarify the situation and help allay any concerns or misapprehensions which might exist as regards the import of the small quantity of affected seed. This was a small consignment presented for trial with no indication or knowledge at the time that there were any GMO implications. The product was not put on sale commercially in Ireland and my Department and the EPA are working closely to establish the full facts of the case. This issue is being dealt with thoroughly and openly, not just in the context of the issue itself but also in the interest of our environment and the food industry which we cherish so dearly.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the intention to decentralise Departments, Government offices and State sponsored bodies which will mean a further 10,000 civil and public service jobs going to the provinces. There is no need to highlight the benefits to Dublin of easing population pressures in the capital and, clearly, a major welcome throughout the country awaits the public servants.</P>
      <P>I accept the voluntary nature of the arrangements but when I was a Minister of State there was a huge interest on the part of staff in moving away from Dublin, particularly to attractive provincial locations. There has already been decentralisation to 20 provincial centres in 19 counties but, to date, there has been none to the most attractive location in the country, south west Cork. Three months ago I suggested the decentralisation of a Government office to Bandon, the largest town in south west Cork. Following that proposal, a major submission was prepared and presented by the Bandon Chamber of Commerce. A further major presentation was also prepared by the Dunmanway Employment Initiative and it will shortly be submitted to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. Excellent facilities are also available in other west Cork towns.</P>
      <P>The title of the Bandon document is &ldquo;Bandon &ndash; The Right Move&rdquo;. Bandon is only 20 miles west of Cork city. A modern vibrant town, it has fantastic attractions as a location. It is convenient, well serviced and offers an attractive quality of life to relocated employees. I can vouch for that because I live there. It is close to Cork city and airport and is easily accessible to traffic from Dublin <i>via </i>the Jack Lynch Tunnel. It is connected to the national communications network, head post office and divisional Garda headquarters. It has everything required to make it attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local chamber of commerce has identified a landbank of potential development sites. It has <Col N="565" /> also found a number of interested developers and a local organisation is willing to co-ordinate a public-private partnership initiative. Of huge importance is that the rental cost for office space in the Bandon area is approximately £12 per square foot compared with an average of more than £30 per square foot in Dublin. That offers a huge saving to the Government. The town and hinterland of Bandon has a population of more than 16,000 so there is sufficient population to absorb a large departmental office. The case for Bandon has been beautifully and well made in the document submitted to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the document from Dunmanway makes a strong case. Dunmanway is the geographical centre of west Cork and enjoys a prime central and accessible location. It can offer the availability of existing buildings for office space. There is also a 5.5 acre industrial zoned land bank. The town suffered a recent major loss in the shape of the biggest industrial employer in the town so there will be more than 100,000 welcomes for any office decentralised there. What is particularly important about Dunmanway is the strong community spirit and the vibrant social, sporting and cultural life. Another important asset is the vibrant community organisation, the Dunmanway Employment Initiative, which will be ready to assist in the move to Dunmanway.</P>
    <P>While I am not entirely objective, the case for decentralisation to south west Cork is compelling. Hordes of foreign tourists descend on its many towns and villages from Kinsale in the east to Castletownbere in the west. Bandon has filed an impressive document making an unanswerable case, while the Dunmanway document, which is equally impressive, is now on its way. I am offering the Government the best location in Ireland. South west Cork has been overlooked in previous phases of decentralisation. Apart from the justice and equity of its case at this stage, the Government would be blind if it continued to ignore the obvious attractions of Bandon, Dunmanway and other west Cork towns in its current decentralisation programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for giving me the opportunity to return to this important issue of decentralisation which, as Deputies will be aware, has been the subject of considerable interest both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the budget day announcement, the Minister for Finance has been more than surprised by the interest in a new programme of decentralisation. In terms of correspondence coming into his Department, there has not been a subject which has attracted so much interest in recent months. The Minister for Finance has received representations on behalf of or submissions from more than 90 cities, towns and villages anxious to accommodate a decentralised Department. The <Col N="566" /> Minister and I pay tribute to the many local authorities, chambers of commerce and community associations who have made so many impressive submissions setting out the case for the inclusion in the forthcoming programme of their respective localities.</P>
    <P>I know that in this House there are a large number of enthusiastic advocates of the policy of decentralisation, and the Minister for Finance is determined that the new programme will be the most ambitious and successful in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>As I am sure Deputies are aware by now, the Minister for Finance is currently engaged in an intensive series of meetings with his Government colleagues and arising from these meetings he will be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly. It is also his firm intention that the Government will be in a position to take decisions on a new and extensive programme of decentralisation within the next couple of months. The Minister's determination to progress the issue follows on from his previously mentioned budget day announcement of the Government's intention to embark on a new and radical programme of decentralisation with the transfer of the maximum number of public sector jobs from Dublin.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of this policy, the Government intends to relocate almost entire Departments or offices and other public bodies to provincial centres. It is intended that the forthcoming programme will, for the first time, involve non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. The Minister for Finance's budget announcement endorses the commitment set out in the reviewed An Action Programme for the Millennium to a policy of balanced regional development and sets as a key priority the channelling of public sector jobs into provincial areas. In developing a new programme the Government has in mind a number of objectives, including the promotion of regional development, the reduction of congestion in Dublin, the establishment of a more even spread of public sector jobs around the country and the procurement of office accommodation at lower cost than in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The current programme of decentralisation, which is expected to be completed in the early part of next year, will involve the relocation of more than 4,000 civil servants from Dublin to a large number of provincial locations. The impact of this programme cannot be underestimated given that it involves almost 20 towns and cities throughout the country. Deputy O'Keeffe is not alone in this House in seeing the benefits of decentralisation. I am sure many Members of the House share the view that decentralisation has brought considerable benefits to many communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be surprised to learn that almost 50% of all civil servants are now located outside <Col N="567" /> Dublin and while decentralisation cannot account for all that, it has played a major part and has contributed significantly to a greater geographical spread of Government services. All regions of the country have benefited from the Government's policy on decentralisation and it is the Government's intention that the new programme will maintain that policy. It is obvious that the addition of new jobs to an area, whether through decentralisation or otherwise, gives a positive economic boost to such an area. New jobs result in increased economic growth and better use of existing, and often under-used, local infrastructure.</P>
    <P>While we are all conscious of the coverage which the proposals in relation to decentralisation have received recently, particularly in the media, the Minister for Finance wants to express a word of caution against any expectation that a largescale relocation of public servants to provincial locations is imminent. Members of the House will appreciate that considerable planning will be required before this most ambitious programme is commenced. It will be necessary to identify appropriate blocks of work, select and train staff and source suitable accommodation. I say this not to demonstrate any lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Minister for Finance or the Government but simply to emphasise that after decisions are taken it will be some time before staff arrive in their new locations.</P>
    <P>To return to the many representations and very worthwhile submissions which the Minister for Finance has received on the subject of decentralisation, I assure those who have been making such representations and presenting such submissions that all these cases will be taken into account by the Government as part of the consultative process which the Minister has initiated. In that context, I assure Deputy O'Keeffe that the case now being made by him for the inclusion of Bandon and other towns such as Kinsale, Clonakilty, Skibbereen. Bantry, Dunmanway, Castletownbere, Schull and so on in the forthcoming programme has been noted and will be fully considered in the context of the process on which the Minister has embarked. However, the Deputy will appreciate that until such time as the Government has had the opportunity to consider all aspects relating to the new programme, it would not be prudent for the Minister for Finance to comment on the likelihood of any particular location featuring in the programme. This is particularly the case given the number of centres anxious to be included. I assure the House of the Minister for Finance's personal commitment to ensuring the successful implementation of this new and radical programme of decentralisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter and the Minister of State for his presence in the House to respond positively, I hope.</P>
      <P>Donegal, with a population of almost 130,000 people, urgently requires a hospice centre. The Donegal Hospice Movement was established in March 1988 by a small group of committed and dedicated people. The first home care sister commenced working in January 1989. There are now four home care sisters working throughout County Donegal, providing palliative care for patients whose disease is non-responsive to curative treatment. Control of pain, other symptoms and physical, social and spiritual problems is paramount. The goal of palliative care is the achievement of the best possible quality of life for patients and their families. No patient is charged for hospice service. The provision of this service, Hospice At Home, enables patients to remain at home longer. The cost of home care service in Donegal is raised voluntarily and in excess of £666,000 has been collected and spent from 1992 to date.</P>
      <P>The North Western Health Board provides £20,000 per annum from lottery funding, which is forwarded to the Foyle Hospice in Derry to help defray the cost of the salary of home care sisters who cover the Inishowen area. In addition, Donegal Hospice pays Foyle Hospice £15,000 per annum as a retainer so that Donegal patients can get a bed in the Foyle Hospice when required.</P>
      <P>In view of the very high number of people requiring hospice care, it was decided in December 1997 that Donegal Hospice Limited should build a hospice in Letterkenny for the people of Donegal. Over the past two years, many meetings have taken place with the North Western Health Board, which is providing a site at Knocknamona, Letterkenny, free of charge. Many plans were drawn up before the final plans were agreed and launched in April 1999. At that time the building cost was estimated at £980,000 so it was hoped the overall cost would be £1.3 million. However, in October 1999 the quantity surveyor provided a revised costing of £1.3 million so the Hospice Movement expected the project could be finalised for a total of £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>Tenders were forwarded to five building contractors who expressed an interest in the project. The tender approved by the hospice directors was for £1.404 million, which is a further £300,000 higher than the estimated figure which the quantity surveyor had outlined in October 1999 and it is envisaged at this stage that work on the project will commence in August of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> At this point, the hospice building fund has at its disposal £1.05 million. The breakdown of the figure is a contribution from the Government millennium fund of £100,000; North Western Health Board, £300,000 and Donegal Hospice, £650,000. The VAT outlined in the approved tender amounts to £157,847 which will go to the Department of Finance, thus the millennium grant of £100,000 is more than eroded. The balance of the VAT will have to be raised from the voluntary contributions of the people of Donegal. To finish the project it is envisaged the hospice directors will have to borrow at least between £700,000 and £800,000 unless further funding can be obtained from the Government through the national lottery or from some other source. Donegal Hospice has raised £650,000 to date and continues to fund raise. This is in addition in having to raise funds for the homecare service which has been provided in the county for the past 11 years. All members of the committee of Donegal Hospice are giving their time free of charge and in many cases at great financial cost to themselves.</P>
    <P>To defer this project is not an option as building costs continue to escalate, so the building project must now proceed without further delay. I am asking the Minister to favourably consider the application for national lottery funding submitted last February by the Donegal Hospice Committee. They have already shown their dedication and commitment to the project. A similar response from the Government is absolutely necessary to bring this much needed project to completion.</P>
    <P>Finally, it should not have been necessary for me to raise the lack of funding for the Donegal Hospice. The funding should have already been delivered by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, who sits beside the Minister for Health and Children at the Cabinet table and who is a founder member and a director of Donegal Hospice. As a director and a doctor he is aware of all the needs and facts as I have outlined them. Deputy McDaid is doing a good job in his official capacity as Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. He must now use his influence with his ministerial colleague and deliver this much needed and indeed overdue facility for County Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The organisation and development of palliative and hospice care services in the Donegal area is a matter for the North Western Health Board. I assure the Deputy I have been made well aware of the situation pertaining to Donegal Hospice by my colleagues in Donegal, not least <Col N="570" /> by the Minister, Deputy McDaid, who can be regarded as one of the founders of hospice in Donegal, as was said by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that it has contributed a site to a value in excess of £300,000 and a further sum of £300,000 to date to the Donegal Hospice movement in respect of the development of hospice accommodation. Building work on the residential unit is due to commence in September 2000 with an anticipated completion date of late 2001. Tenders have now been obtained for the work and it is understood that costs exceed the estimates of the design team. The board has been in touch with the hospice directors with a view to discussing the shortfall of funds currently available and the revised costs. I understand that preliminary discussions have already taken place and the board expects to satisfactorily conclude these in the coming fortnight. The outcome will involve an increased contribution from the board. The board has indicated that it is most anxious to see this project proceed in partnership with Donegal Hospice.</P>
      <P>In relation to palliative care services in general, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop a national hospice plan. Given this commitment, the nature of the development of palliative care services to date and the wide ranging issues involved from both statutory and voluntary and national and local perspectives, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, established the national advisory committee on palliative care services in September 1999. The committee will prepare a report recommending a comprehensive national policy for the strategic planning and development of palliative care services nationally. I expect to be presented with the report at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>A development programme for palliative care services was funded as part of the action plan 1997-9 under the national cancer strategy. The allocation in 1997 was £2.2 million, in 1998 it was £2.45 million and in 1999 it was £1.8 million. This funding has been used to establish new consultant posts in palliative care medicine in the Mid-Western, South Eastern and Western Health Board areas. Additional nursing, para-medical and administrative staff have also been appointed.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain momentum on service developments and in preparation for the publication of the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care, a further £3.3 million has been allocated to palliative care services in 2000. This will provide six additional posts of consultant in palliative care medicine. There will now be a consultant led service in each health board area and additional nursing staff to expand the homecare and day care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to strengthen the working relationship between the statutory and voluntary agencies in the palliative care area in order <Col N="571" /> to provide the best possible level and quality of services to patients and their families. For this reason £300,000 has been allocated to the North Western Health Board in 2000, £125,000 of which is for a consultant post in palliative care. The remaining £175,000 is for the <Col N="572" /> development of palliative care services in the health board region. I hope this meets with the approval of the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 June 2000.</P>

      <P>The monthly live register figures show how many people are claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or signing for social welfare credits. At the end of April, there were 161,796 persons on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results are normally published within a <Col N="574" /> week, making the live register a widely-used short-term indicator. The CSO's monthly releases contain a considerable amount of detail at local level, including breakdowns of the number of claimants by sex, age group and type of claimant.</P>
    <P>However, the live register does not measure unemployment on a basis that is comparable over time or between countries. It is an administrative measure and the figures reflect people's benefit status as distinct from their labour force status. It includes many people who are not unemployed, for example, part-time workers who are entitled under the social welfare rules to sign on in respect of days when they do not have work.</P>
    <P>The primary source of comparable statistics on unemployment is the quarterly national household survey. This survey provides quarterly figures on employment and unemployment which meet the ILO's guidelines for internationally comparable labour force statistics. Now that the main results of this survey are being published within three months, the CSO has established a labour market statistics liaison group which will advise the office on how its labour market publications can best meet the needs of data users. This will include the continuing publication of live register statistics as well as more detailed results from the quarterly national household survey. It is not envisaged that the live register statement would be discontinued in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>On 15 December last, I announced my strategic plan for the development of the film industry in Ireland following consideration of the report of the film industry strategic review group.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to assign the audiovisual industry a central place in Ireland's industrial policy through co-ordinated commitment of the industrial agencies of the State, together with the Irish Film Board, to the development of the industry's full potential and, in particular, to fostering strong indigenous companies in this sector. Underpinned by the five year extension of the section 481 tax scheme for investment in film, the Government has approved the strengthening and enhancement of the Irish film board to address the strategic goals identified in the report of the film industry strategic review group. The board will be assigned substantially increased capital and staff resources for its new functions.</P>
      <P>I am in the final stage of appointing consultants to make recommendations to me on the appropriate governance and executive structures the board will require to take on the additional responsibilities recommended by the group. Arrangements are being made to increase the capital ceiling for the board in anticipation of increased investment by the board in development, production and training.</P>
      <P>Finally, Ireland recently signed and ratified the European Convention on cinematographic co-production. This will provide a framework to facilitate Irish companies to enter into co-production agreements with European partners, with mutual access to public funding for production activities in their respective countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussions to date with the National Roads Authority on a code of practice, my Department has been represented by a senior archaeological officer from both Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and the National Museum of Ireland. Both these officers have long and wide ranging experience in archaeology and I am satisfied that they have the necessary credentials to make a valuable and informed input into those discussions. I therefore do not propose to augment the composition of my Department's team involved in these discussions. Furthermore, the senior status of the officers already involved reflect the importance which I and my Department attach to agreeing a code of practice.</P>
      <P>The discussions on the code of practice are ongoing and I have no plans to publish it until such time as agreement has been reached. The code is intended to form the basis of a framework within existing legislation and policies and within which the NRA will be able to progress with its programme of work whilst carrying out appropriate archaeological mitigation which has regard to a set of principles and agreed actions by both parties. The code will have no legal standing <i>per se</i>. It will be in accordance with the requirements of the National Monuments Act. It will be reviewed and monitored by both parties to ensure that it delivers on its intended objectives and amended or updated as necessary.</P>

      <Quest>the infor mation she has about the legal action being brought against Ireland before the European Court of Justice for failure to inform the EU Commission about protected sites by the June 1995 deadline and the delay in establishing Natura 2000.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to this matter is as set out in my answer to the Deputy's question of 31 May 2000. The Deputy will be aware this matter is <i>sub-judice</i> and consequently my response must be limited.</P>
      <P>The habitats directive requires member states to propose, on the basis of specified scientific criteria, relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation &ndash; SACs. It also obliges member states to protect their favourable conservation status and to transmit a list of the proposed areas, together with full information on each site, within three years of the date of the notification of the directive, by June 1995, to the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94/97). The main part of Ireland's SAC network has, since March 1997, been publicly advertised for SAC designation and receives legal protection in Ireland from that date.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has instituted proceedings against Ireland, in the European Court of Justice, for the non-transmission of special areas of conservation to it within the time scale set out in the directive. The Commission has been informed of all the sites that I have advertised for designation.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission agrees with me, and with the Government, that the viability of the Natura 2000 network of sites is dependent on the co-operation of the landowners and land users whose lands are included in the sites. I believe that all those whose lands are proposed for SAC designation must be given an opportunity to object to the proposals, on scientific grounds, before I formally transmit the list to the Commission. To this end I have provided an opportunity for landowners and land users to have their appeals examined informally by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department. I have also established a formal independent board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman, and comprising representation from the landowners and the conservation organisations, to independently assess appeals and to advise me on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Commission has been notified of our proposals in relation to SACs and the reasons for the failure to meet the deadline for transmission of the list of sites to the commission. The commission is also aware that, while Ireland is technically not in compliance with the directive, the advertised sites receive full protection under our national legislation. I expect that prior to the <Col N="581" /> completion of the legal proceedings, Ireland will be in full compliance with the directive.</P>
    <P>The delay in transmitting the Irish sites is not the sole delaying factor in the establishment of the Natura 2000 network. No member state in the Atlantic region, of which Ireland is part, has provided a full and complete list of these sites to the EU Commission. The commission will examine the situation again at the next Atlantic region biogeographical seminar in October 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department has formally transmitted 264 SAC sites to the Commission, leaving 58 sites to be transmitted when appeals have been dealt with. I have recently publicly advertised an additional 41 sites, mainly dealing with the marine area. It is my intention to transmit these to the EU Commission as soon as objections have been dealt with and after the three month time period prescribed in the regulations for the submission of objections has elapsed.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is examining existing river sites to determine if they also qualify for designation as salmon SACs. My Department is also investigating whether additional sites need to be proposed for this species.</P>

      <P>Since the decision of An Bord Pleanála was delivered refusing planning permission for an entry point to the Burren National Park, I and my officials have, with our legal and planning advisers, carefully considered all aspects of the matter. I accept that there is an obligation on the State, arising from decisions of the High Court and the Supreme Court in this case, to restore the land in question to its condition prior to the commencement of the development, in so far as this is practicable. Given the unique characteristics of the area, however, I consider that it would be highly desirable to carry out an environmental appraisal of the likely impacts of the reinstatement works on the environment at the site location to ensure that no significant adverse effect on the environment will result from the remedial works.</P>
      <P>I have, accordingly, asked the Commissioners of Public Works to prepare a detailed reinstatement plan for the site. When this is to hand, I will arrange for an appropriate technical assessment of environmental impact, following which the matter will be referred back to the High Court in due course. I would expect that, given the considerable work involved, these assessments will not be completed for some time.  </P>

Consequently, as an tÚdarás did not require the funds, the Organisations Grant-in-Aid for 1999, grants to industry &ndash; Subhead H.2. of the Departments' Vote, was reduced by £1.4 million.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 36 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication by the Heritage Council of its policy paper on heritage awareness, which conveys the results of research on this issue carried out early last year on behalf of the council. The researchers found that 86% of the respondents believed that it was important to protect our heritage, while 76% of those surveyed agreed that heritage protection was everybody's responsibility. These are highly encouraging figures to work from.</P>
      <P>The research demonstrated a number of areas where greater awareness of aspects of our heritage may be achieved and this is an important goal for my Department, reflected in the commitment contained in its statement of strategy to promote and develop an increased public appreciation of the importance and value of the built and natural heritage. The national heritage plan, which will be published later this year, will address the question of raising heritage awareness.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council, which is an independent statutory body, is also charged with promoting interest, education, knowledge and pride in, and facilitating the appreciation and enjoyment of heritage. I have no doubt that its future activities in respect of this function will seek to build on the recommendations contained in its paper on heritage awareness.</P>

      <P>I do not have the information requested by the Deputy and have no responsibility for providing information in relation to the condition of buildings.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nationwide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. The Government is committed to completing all interim county surveys within the next two years and the complete national inventory within a period of twelve years.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, provides that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has the power to draw up and amend codes governing standards, practice and prohibitions in advertising and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting. Paragraph 15 of the codes drawn up under that provision places a number of restrictions on the advertising of alcohol. The restrictions are designed to prevent the broadcasting of advertisements for alcoholic drink aimed at young people and advertisements that would encourage immoderate consumption. The codes also recognise a voluntary code whereby spirit based alcoholic drinks, whiskey, gin, etc., are not <Col N="587" /> advertised on radio and television. I have no plans at present to introduce further restrictions at this time. For the sake of clarity I should point out that the codes mentioned above, including the voluntary code relating to the advertising of spirit based alcoholic drinks, apply only to indigenous broadcasters and not to the many British and other European broadcasting services that are available at present.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, provides that the Independent Radio and Television Commission, to be renamed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland under the Bill, will, in future, be responsible for drawing up codes specifying standards to be complied with, and rules and practices to be observed, in respect of advertising, teleshopping, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion employed on any broadcasting service. When the Bill is enacted, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will be free to amend the existing codes as it sees fit.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to my role in conserving the integrity of sites that have been proposed as natural heri<Col N="588" /> tage areas; special protection areas and special areas of conservation.</P>
      <P>Windfarms on land require planning permission, so decisions on particular windfarm developments are primarily the responsibility of the local authorities. As part of the planning process, these authorities consult my Department on any proposal that may impact on designated areas. My Department examines these proposals to see whether or not they are consistent with the conservation objectives of the site. Where it is considered that a proposal will cause significant damage to the site my Department objects to planning permission being given.</P>
      <P>I should stress that my Department's consideration of any proposal is confined to the scientific issues of conservation and may not include other issues such as scenic or aesthetic values. Most issues of concern arise at the construction stage, for example, drainage of peatland for new access roads, but there can also be ongoing effects on bird populations. Windfarms should only be permitted in designated areas where conservation issues can be satisfactorily addressed.</P>

As I indicated in my recent speech in Clonmel, under ACCESS, the new arts and culture capital enhancment support scheme which I announced recently, financial assistance will be available to local authorities for suitable major capital improvement projects at county museums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> In addition, under section 68 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997 the Director of the National Museum of Ireland may, with my consent, designate local museums as appropriate places for the curation of certain State-owned archaeological objects that are predominantly of local rather than of national interest. I am pleased to say that I consented to such designations last November for eight local authority museums in Cavan, Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan and Tipperary South Riding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the claims made by the Heritage Council and indeed I welcomed the publication of its report on this subject as it brings a new focus to the problem of the destruction of archaeological monuments which has been a source of concern to me and to the archaeological survey of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously acknowledged that this problem exists, notwithstanding the significant legislative powers which are available to me. I am continuing to examine means by which the services provided by my Department's conservation rangers could be extended to include some monitoring of archaeological sites as well as a repositioning of the archaeological resources in my Department so as to provide a more localised service that brings it closer to those heritage sites that we are endeavouring to preserve and protect. In addition, I am exploring means by which local <Col N="591" /> authorities would assume an enhanced role in the protection of the archaeological heritage at a local level while I also see scope for developing alliances with other local interest groups whereby they could assist in keeping a watch over archaeological sites and monuments at the local level. These are initiatives which I intend to explore further in consultation with the Heritage Council in the context of the proposed national heritage plan, which I will be publishing later this year.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise, however, that all known archaeological sites and monuments have been entered in the record of monuments established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. Notice of the publication of the record for each county has been given in the local newspapers and copies of the record are available in public libraries, local authority planning offices and in certain Teagasc offices. Landowners should, if they have not already done so, check the record to see if any recorded monuments are on their land as they are required to give two months written notification to Dúchas prior to carrying out works at, or in relation to, a recorded monument.</P>
    <P>I also see the need for better education and public awareness, which I am constantly striving to achieve through various initiatives, including an annual heritage newsletter to all primary schools. This and other initiatives will be pursued further in the context of the heritage plan. The plan will also be concentrating on initiatives to provide better training for all those who work for the protection of the heritage to ensure that they are equipped with sufficient levels of knowledge and practical training to allow them to carry out their roles to the greatest advantage. Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the principal legislative protection for archaeological sites and monuments is contained in the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994. Notices were placed in the main national newspapers on 15 November 1999 inviting submissions from interested parties in relation to a proposed review of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, and related legislation.</P>
    <P>As the public consultation phase of the review is now complete, it is my intention that the review will lead to the drafting of consolidated and, where appropriate, revised and extended legislation for the protection of the archaeological, architectural and historic heritage.</P>
    <P>I am confident through these various measures that the destruction of our archaeological sites can be arrested.</P>

      <P>In answering this question it must be noted that the only galleries under the aegis of my Department are the National Gallery of Ireland and the Irish Museum of Modern <Col N="593" /> Art and that the acquisitions policy of both institutions is strictly a matter for themselves.</P>
      <P>I am glad to inform the Deputy that the funding for acquisition and conservation for the National Gallery is £750,000 for the current year. The amount in respect of acquisitions by the Irish Museum of Modern Art is £250,000 for the current year. These figures represent increases in the resources for acquisition of 285% for the National Gallery and 52% for the Irish Museum of Modern Art, respectively since 1997.</P>
      <P>Both institutions can avail of the tax relief provisions for donations of artworks under section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, the limit on which this year was increased from £0.75 million to £3.0 million in the Finance Act.</P>
      <P>On the issue of whether I consider the resources are adequate I would draw the attention of the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Ryan's Question No. 14 on 29 April 1999 in which I set out the overall resourcing position in relation to the National Gallery.

      <P>As I stated in my previous replies to questions on 1 February 2000 and 2 March 2000, reference numbers 2323/00 and 6304/00 respectively, my Department has responsibility for implementing the EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC and the EU Birds Directive 79/49/EEC, and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that both directives are being implemented. However, the EU Commission initiated legal action against Ireland for failure to transmit a full list of special areas of conservation as required under the EU Habitats Directive. When the Government came into office in 1997, I discovered that none of these sites were formally transmitted to the EU Commission. I also came to the conclusion that inadequate consultation with landowners, and land rights owners, had occurred and the opportunity of landowners to avail of appeals procedures should be provided. Since coming into power I have established an independent board to advise me in respect of objections to the proposed designations submitted, on specific grounds, by land owners and land <Col N="594" /> rights holders. In addition, my Department has requested landowners and land rights holders to establish liaison committees for each site as a forum where difficulties that may arise can be dealt with speedily.</P>
      <P>I have since transmitted 264 sites to the Commission and a further 58 sites are currently under appeal. I have recently advertised an additional 41, largely marine, sites. I am also looking at the possibility of including some additional raised bog sites and some sites for salmon. The Deputy will be aware that once sites are published they are protected under Irish law.</P>
      <P>I believe that the long-term viability of these sites for nature conservation purposes requires my Department to secure the co-operation of landowners and land users, prior to including lands in the European network of sites. Accordingly, I do not propose to formally transmit any site until the objections relating to each one are dealt with.</P>
      <P>In addition, a reasoned opinion has been issued in respect of over-grazing, particularly in regard to the Owenduff/Nephin Beg site in the context of the Birds Directive. Despite a full response outlining steps taken to deal with the matter, I have recently been informed that the Commission intends to pursue legal action.</P>
      <P>In respect of the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) the Commission has initiated proceedings against Ireland for non-implementation. This case is being vigorously defended by my Department.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in previous replies to similar questions, before consideration can be given to establishing digital audio broadcasting, DAB, in Ireland it will be necessary to develop a national policy for its introduction. This will require extensive consultation with all relevant organisations in the sound broadcasting sector.</P>
      <P>Some preliminary work in this regard has been progressed by RTE through its programme of test transmissions and the establishment of an informal DAB Forum involving the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, ODTR, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, Independent Radio and Television Commission, RTE, the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, Today FM, the community radio sector and officials from my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>While my immediate broadcasting priority is the introduction of digital terrestrial television and the enactment of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, I have invited the DAB forum to consider the issues involved and advise in respect of the broadcasting policy options for the successful introduction of DAB. In order to support the work of the forum I propose to fund and appoint a project manager for a six month period.</P>
      <P>The duties of the manager will include researching and identifying elements which are critical to the project, eliciting areas of common interest to each of the broadcasting sectors, documenting and putting forward options for consideration by the forum and preparing, in consultation with forum members, a range of policy options on the introduction of DAB in Ireland. It is my intention that the project manager will be available to the forum in September 2000.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the forum at its meeting in early May welcomed this initiative. I look forward to hearing from the forum in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibilities of the Director of Consumer Affairs in relation to monitoring the changeover to the euro are twofold, and may be summarised as follows: under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, the Director of Consumer Affairs has responsibility for monitoring customer charges by the credit institutions, and for issuing directions under section 149 of the Act to those institutions in relation to increases in existing charges and charges for new services-products. Notifications under section 149 are applicable in relation to the euro to the extent that credit institutions propose to restructure their customer charges prior to the introduction of the euro in cashless form as from 1 January 1999. I am satisfied that the director has sufficient resources to monitor compliance by the credit institutions with the decisions she made concerning their euro-specific customer charges.</P>
      <P>Congruent with her responsibility under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, for promoting codes of practice, the Director of Consumer Affairs will monitor compliance with either the national or sectoral codes on dual display of prices by those bodies which voluntarily adhere to them. I am satisfied that the director has sufficient resources at her disposal to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The Director of Consumer Affairs is not solely responsible for monitoring the changeover to the euro. Overall responsibility in that connection rests with the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland. Responsibility for specific aspects lies with appropriate bodies at EU and national level. For example, the Deputy will be aware of the recently published survey undertaken for the European Commission in the 11 euro zone countries in relation to bank charges, which appears to have uncovered possible breaches of the cross-frontier transfers directive, 97/5/EC &ndash; for which neither the Director of Consumer Affairs nor my Department is responsible &ndash; in ten of the 11 member states, that is, with the exception of Ireland. Another example would be the trans-European automated real-time gross settlement express transfer, known as TARGET, for which the European Central Bank is responsible, and which is used for credit transfers in euro between member states as well as for inter-bank and customer payments.</P>

      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, have responded to the request to review the issue of flammability of clothing. A joint report has been presented to my Department.</P>
      <P>The NSAI and Director of Consumer Affairs' study concludes that the introduction of unilateral flammability requirements for clothing in Ireland is not feasible, because of toxicological-ecotoxicological considerations, the fact that it would have the effect of severely limiting the availability of clothing on the Irish market and cost. It should be noted, however, that following a meeting in December 1999, the European Union 98/34 Committee on standards and technical regulations gave CEN, European Committee for Standardisation, a mandate to prepare a draft european standard which would specifically apply to the flammability of nightwear. It is expected that this standard will be developed within the next 12 to 18 months. When completed, this will be introduced as an identical Irish standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NSAI and Director of Consumer Affairs are of the view that the issue of accidents due to flammability of clothing in general is best addressed through safety campaigns targeted at <Col N="598" /> users of open fires, fuel effect fires, portable LPG fires and, possibly, electric fires. Such campaigns are effective in alerting the public to the possible dangers associated with loose clothing in proximity to open flames and perhaps the use of such campaigns should be increased, particularly during the winter period. I propose to take this matter up with the National Safety Council with a view to initiating such a campaign.</P>

      <P>The Consumers Association of Ireland, CAI, is a wholly independent, non-governmental organisation. My understanding is that it receives most of its funding from its membership and magazine and publication income, and that it receives part funding from time to time from the European Commission for projects undertaken to protect and promote consumer interests.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, in 1998, the CAI made a submission for funding to the Minister for Finance, which was supported by my Department once my officials were informed about it. The application was not successful however. At around the same time, my officials had inconclusive discussions with the CAI on the question of financial support from my Department. Recently, and in the course of contact on another matter with the CAI, the opportunity arose for my officials to reopen this question, and it was agreed jointly to pursue it afresh over the course of the coming six months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The human rights situation in Algeria remains a cause for concern, even if improvements are taking place. At the recent 56th Session of the UN Commission of Human Rights, Ireland, together with our EU partners, welcomed a number of positive developments in Algeria and signs of co-operation by the Government of Algeria with its international partners. In response to representations by the European Union, the Algerian authorities have furnished information to the EU Presidency about a number of disappearance cases. They have undertaken to follow up with further information and advised the Presidency that they have undertaken to keep the Commission of Human Rights informed on a regular basis about cases of persons reported to have disappeared in Algeria. It is clearly important that these assurances are kept.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the EU are encouraging Algeria to persevere with necessary economic and social reforms and modernisation and improvements in human rights, particularly in the context of Algeria's Barcelona process commitments, under which concrete constructive assistance is being provided. In this context, the moves by President Bouteflika's Government towards economic and social modernisation and reform, though currently in a delicate phase and resisted by some elements, can provide the basis for a peaceful future for Algeria. Full respect for human rights will be an essential element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the stated readiness of the Algerian Government to engage with human rights groups and continue to call for full and effective <Col N="602" /> co-operation with UN mechanisms, and in particular for access for UN special rapporteurs. A 12 day mission to Algeria by Amnesty International earlier this month found a clear improvement in human rights but added that it was still too soon to draw a definitive conclusion. The four person mission met with leading Algerian Government officials and local human rights leaders and travelled to the interior of the country to speak with witnesses.</P>
    <P>The acceptance of the Government amnesty by the Islamic Salvation Front, whose military wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, formally moved to disband under the agreement reached with the Government, is a positive move towards an end to years of conflict. Clearly, further steps are necessary, and it is important that all groups continue to work for the security, stability and reconciliation of the country. In this regard we remain deeply concerned by the continued activity of the Armed Islamic Group, which has been responsible for atrocities often involving massacre and mutilation.</P>

While I am not in a position to state when this work will be completed, I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to exercise every effort to achieve in full the objectives of the of the EU code of conduct at an early date as well as the overall objectives which I have described above.</P>

      <P>The overall national development plan makes provision for public investment of £299.3 million in public transport infrastructure in the Border, midland and west region, including the Westmeath area.</P>
      <P>Iarnrod Eireann will be purchasing additional rolling stock, undertaking major track renewal and upgrading work. The NDP also includes provision for acquisition of additional vehicles and infrastructural development by Bus Eireann.</P>
      <P>Details of specific services to be provided are a matter for the individual companies.</P>
      <P>A sum of £152 million has been allocated to co-fund investment in advanced communications and e-commerce infrastructure and services under the NDP for the years 2000 to 2006, with £100 million of this amount being allocated to the Border, midlands and west region. I expect to issue the first call for proposals for funding in communications and e-commerce infrastructure under the new NDP measures during the coming months.</P>

      <P>I am aware of complaints in relation to aircraft noise from residents in Beaumont and Santry. The works on the rapid exit taxiway, as referred to by the Deputy, required closure of the main runway at night and the consequential exclusive use of the secondary runway. These works were completed in mid April.</P>
      <P>However, engineering works to facilitate the relocation of a shelter to house equipment relating to the landing system resulted in the continued use of the secondary runway to a greater extent than would normally be the case. It is expected that these works will be finalised shortly and the main runway will then be back in full service at night time with a consequent reduction in noise. The secondary runway will, of course, continue to be used for operational reasons as required.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Irish Aviation Authority that because newer aircraft can land at higher weights there is less need to dump fuel in flight. In the rare case when an aircraft must dump fuel, the operation is conducted in such a way as to avoid built up areas, except in cases of exceptional emergency.</P>
      <P>Fuel dumped in the air tends to dissipate as fine droplets and vaporizes before it falls to earth.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that Eircom still maintains exclusive use of lines in spite of a commitment arising from deregulation of the telecoms market in 1998 and a commitment from the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to give limited access to these lines to other telephone providers.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my announcement that Ireland would be ending its derogation on full liberalisation in 1998, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation issued 21 general and eight basic telecommunications licences. General licences enable operators to provide a full range of services to the general public, whereas basic licences cover all services other than voice telephony and services involving numbers. This process has been on going and there are now over 44 general licences and 26 basic licences in issue. The interconnection regulations issued in 1998 enable these new entrants to connect their customers with the bulk of telephone users and to carry calls on Eircom's network at rates set by the director.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications licenses also allow an operator to build and operate a telecommunication's network of its own. However, it is generally not economically feasible for an operator to roll out its network to the local network or local loop and operators generally rely on Eircom's local network for access to their customers.</P>
      <P>Cable operators who also hold telecommunications licences are entitled to offer telephony services over their own cable networks and, therefore, do not need to rely on Eircom's local loop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been working in close co-operation with the director's office on a number of projects to enable other licensed operators to access the local loop. On 19 April this year, the director issued her decision on local loop unbundling. The director's decision provides for managed bit stream access and will enable oper<Col N="606" /> ators to provide advanced services over the copper line. The decision also provides the framework for investigation by working groups of full physical LLU with a target date for introduction of April 2001.</P>
    <P>Another initiative by the director includes licensing the use of wireless in the local loop. This provides an alternative where the laying of wired networks may not be economically feasible. Although this process has been delayed due to court proceedings it is hoped that seven of these licences will be awarded by July of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered all submissions made to me in the matter and, in particular, the report of the findings of the public inquiry, I approved a light railway order for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line in September 1999.</P>
      <P>As part of the public inquiry, the inspector, Judge Sean O'Leary, considered the impact of the proposed development on local communities. In the case of Peter's Place, the inspector concluded that, although the community would be affected by the increased activity, any adverse consequences would be minimised by the tangential nature of the interaction between the residential properties and the line. In addition, the inspector considered the properties in that area would be greatly facilitated by the addition of the new transport option.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am aware of, and sympathetic to, the concerns of the Peter's Place residents.</P>
      <P>I understand that discussions have taken place, and are continuing, between CIE's project management team and the residents to try to resolve any difficulties. I welcome this approach.</P>
      <P>A condition of the light railway order that I made in September 1999 is that local liaison committees must be established by CIE for each area along the construction route. The committees will represent the interests of all bodies and groups likely to be affected including the relevant local authority, the Garda Síochána, utilities, business and residential groups. CIE will establish the committee for area seven shortly and I would encourage the Peter's Place residents to become involved.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> I am confident that the partnership approach already initiated will facilitate a workable solution to the residents' concerns.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan, the agriculture, food and related rural development area has been allocated substantial Exchequer and EU funding over the seven year period 2000-2006. The funding relates essentially to measures for farmers and the food processing sector. The following table gives full details.</P>
      <P>As regards progress under the NDP, the position is that negotiations with the European Commission on the community support framework for Ireland, necessary to draw down the EU element of the funds, have recently been completed and the various operational programmes required have been finalised and submitted to Brussels. It is not possible to indicate at this stage when any of the schemes involved will commence but they will all apply in Westmeath, with the exception of the western investment fund and the cattle breeding and equine infrastructure measures. The latter measures relate to organisations located in Cork and Kildare, respectively, but will benefit the country as a whole</P>

      <P>I understand that the UK company concerned supplies commercial quantities of several species of agricultural seeds to the Irish market. Distribution of these seeds is by registered Irish seed merchants. Only seed which has been certified and entered into the national catalogue or the EU common catalogue of agricultural plant varieties may be imported for use in this country.</P>
      <P>A small quantity, 2 kilograms, of the seed was submitted to my Department in 1997-98 for field trials for the purpose of national listing. These trials were undertaken on two sites farmed by my Department. Following the conclusion of the trials the variety in question was not entered on the national catalogue and no further applications were received for evaluation of the seed variety in question. There is no evidence to suggest that any of this seed variety was imported for commercial use here.</P>

      <P>My Department accepted a recommendation from the Ombudsman relating to two incomplete applications for the scheme of early retirement from farming, to <Col N="610" /> the effect that the date of valid application should be calculated as if the applicants had been notified within one month of the deficiencies in their applications. The Ombudsman has asked my Department to apply the same procedure to all cases in future. This recommendation is being considered in the context of discussions with the farming bodies on the protocol for farmers arising out the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>While every effort is made to expedite the processing of applications under the scheme, these must be dealt with along with other priority work. In determining the date of valid application, it is proper to take account of delays on the part of applicants in supplying the necessary supporting documentation. I would emphasise to applicants the need to ensure that their applications are accompanied by all such documents, which are clearly listed in the scheme document and the accompanying guidelines published by my Department.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations governing the quota regime, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven were, up to 1996, required to use at least 50% of that quota in any one of two consecutive years, otherwise the part not used in the second year would be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>The person named held a suckler cow quota of 12 premium rights but he did not use it in 1994 or in 1995. My Department wrote to him on 14 June 1996 seeking the reasons for the non use of the quota but no reply was received from him. There is no record in my Department of having received an application from the person named to lease out his quota. In the circumstances, the quota of 12 premium rights was returned to the national reserve in 1996 and I regret to say that it cannot be restored at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he has taken to ensure that the transport of live animals from here complies with EU legislation in view of the fact that a recent EU Commission investigation revealed that several requirements of Directive 91/628/EEC were very often not met here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has always sought to ensure that animals are transported from Ireland in conditions which meet strict welfare criteria and which comply with EU legislation as regards standards of transport, ventilation, stocking density, rest periods, and fodder and water provisions. Animals being transported are inspected prior to departure to assess their fitness to travel and their health status. In addition, departmental veterinary staff travel from time to time with consignments to monitor conditions and to ensure that the animals arrive in good condition at their destination. Trucks and vessels are inspected before approval for use in the export trade, and follow-up inspections are also carried out. In addition, our legislation specifically precludes ships from sailing when the weather forecasts indicate adverse weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Animal welfare issues, including transport, are subject to regular scrutiny by the European Commission, including inspection missions conducted by the Food and Veterinary Office, which has drawn attention to some deficiencies in relation to transport. I attach considerable importance to animal welfare and to ensuring that every effort <Col N="612" /> is made to ensure compliance with the relevant standards and requirements. My Department will respond positively to any suggestions for improvement which result from time to time from FVO inspections and is always willing to participate with other member states in examining ways in which the animal welfare situation across the EU can be further improved. In this regard, I understand that the EU Commission is currently reviewing the transport legislation and will shortly present a report to the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <P>Compensation at current market value is paid in respect of herds that are destroyed under the arrangements in place to deal with BSE.</P>
      <P>Unlike bovine tuberculosis, for example, where herds are generally restricted for a minimum of four months, herd repopulation is possible in the case of BSE within 30 days, following satisfactory cleansing and disinfection of the farm. There is, therefore, no legislative provision for losses consequential on BSE depopulation.</P>

      <P>The eligibility criteria for the allocation to producers of the additional 20.5 million gallons of the 32 million gallons of milk quota negotiated under Agenda 2000 were set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 42 of 9 December 1999. A total of 15 million gallons is being allocated to active milk producers with quotas of fewer than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquiring additional quota. A further 5 million gallons will be allocated to younger dairy farmers with quotas of fewer than 35,000 gallons who have shown similar commitment. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra <Col N="613" /> quota in order to maximise its effect. The detailed rules for the distribution of this milk quota were published in notices Nos. 266/31, 266/32, 266/33 and 266/34. The balance of 500,000 gallons will be set aside for special cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution.</P>
      <P>The main mechanism under which producers can acquire additional quota for the year 2000-01 is the milk quota restructuring scheme operated at milk purchaser level. The detailed rules for the milk quota restructuring scheme 2000 were published in notices Nos. 94/1 and 94/3.</P>
      <P>A milk quota temporary leasing scheme will also operate and the detailed rules on this will be announced later. The milk quota appeals tribunal will continue to examine applications for quota from the national reserve, including the special reserve of 0.5 million gallons set aside from the 20.5 million gallons allocated under Agenda 2000. Copies of the notices referred to will be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 93, 94 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The WTO negotiations on agriculture have already commenced under the mandate established by Article 20 of the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. The agreement specifically identifies non-trade concerns for inclusion in the negotiations and food security will be treated as a non-trade concern. I am conscious of the importance of actions to support food security in developing countries, as reflected in the development assistance activities of Ireland Aid and the commitments entered into at the World Food Summit in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period to the end of this year will be taken up in examination and analysis of issues and developments and in submissions by member countries. This process will provide all WTO <Col N="614" /> member countries, including the developing countries, with the opportunity to raise issues of concern to them before the negotiations proper begin next year.</P>
    <P>Ireland participates in the WTO negotiations as a member of the EU. The Commission will be negotiating on the basis of a mandate agreed by the Council of Ministers. The mandate reflects the decision by the European Council in Berlin that the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy within the framework of Agenda 2000 would constitute the essential elements of the EU's position for the WTO negotiations. The mandate also recognises the need for a special and differential treatment for the developing countries and acknowledges that the new WTO round should provide benefits to developing countries and assist the integration of those countries, particularly the least developed countries, into the international trade system.</P>

      <Quest>if he will reinstate pension entitlements to a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary in view of the fact that this person's farm retirement pension has been suspended since November, 19996, due to an error by his Department in not changing the area aid reference number, herd number and cattle passports, into the name of his son; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming, a farmer who enters the scheme must undertake to cease all commercial farming definitively.</P>
      <P>The person named was admitted to the scheme on 7 November 1996 and was paid from that date. My Department is not aware of any request from him to change the area aid reference number or cattle passports into the name of his son. His herd number was in joint names of his son and himself, but he made no application to have the name removed from it until August 1998. In the meantime he made application for the following payments.</P>
      <P>On 31 December 1996 he applied in his own name for the ewe premium. On 6 May 1998 he applied in his own name for area aid. On 21 May 1998 he applied jointly with his son for the suckler cow premium. Between 3 November 1997 and 1 July 1998 he applied jointly with his son five times for the special beef premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he was deemed, accordingly, not to have ceased commercial farming on his retirement, my Department had no option but to terminate his participation in the scheme. He appealed this decision and it was reviewed, but my Department found that there was insufficient evidence to sup<Col N="615" /> port his contention that he had in fact ceased all commercial farming activity.</P>

The underpayment arose because all of the taxpayer's taxable income was taxed at the rate of 26% even though part of his income was liable to tax at the rate of 48%.</P>
      <P>The amount of the underpayment has been reduced following recent correspondence between the taxpayer and the inspector. The amount now due is £769.26 and this will be collected over a two year period by reducing the taxpayer's tax-free allowances in 2000-01 and 2001-02.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that since the establishment of the Customs National Drugs Team in 1993, the maritime units based in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Sligo have played an important role in countering the threat of the importation of illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>Having accumulated seven years' operational experience of the Customs National Drugs Team, the board of the Revenue Commissioners decided to establish a high level group to examine all aspects of the CNDT operation. One of the recommendations made by the review group related to the maritime units. The group confirmed that a maritime capability was essential for the customs and excise service to discharge its overall obligations in the area of prevention of smuggling, especially drugs smuggling. The group, however, felt that these units were unable to fully meet their objectives because of the limitations of the type of vessel being used.</P>
      <P>Having considered the options available, the costs involved and the operational coverage required, the review group recommended that a lesser number of larger boats with greater seagoing capabilities should be purchased to replace the existing boats.</P>
      <P>In recommending that these new vessels be located in Rosslare Harbour, Cork Harbour and the Shannon Estuary, the review group was satisfied that these locations maximised the coastal areas that could be covered by the maritime units, being particularly cognisant of the well established risk that is present along the south and south west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Revenue being very conscious of the major implications of any decision in this area and cognisant of our role in association with the <Col N="617" /> other agencies such as the Garda, Navy, Air Corps and other Customs administrations, plan to engage the services of maritime consultants to advise on the precise specification of the craft, the locations and berthing facilities necessary to meet our stringent performance criteria. The process of selecting and engaging the consultant has commenced.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Reynolds that whatever the final decision on the maritime units, it will be taken with the objective of providing the most effective and efficient measures possible to guard our coastal waters against the importation of drugs and other sensitive or dangerous substances.</P>

      <P>I am making arrangements, through the Irish Red Cross Society, for the payment of financial assistance to those Limerick residents affected by the flooding of the Abbey River in the Athlunkard Street-Sir Harry's Mall area of the city over the last Christmas-New Year period.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I took this initiative in relation to Limerick because of the circumstances which arose as a result of works associated with the Limerick main drainage scheme. Although the flooding was caused by extreme bad weather, the works resulted in some delay in the flood waters receding, thus adding to the levels of inconvenience caused. I am satisfied that these particular cir<Col N="618" /> cumstances should not be used as a precedent for such intervention elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The most recently published inflation figures post-date the introduction of the national minimum wage, and indicate that the food sub-index of the consumer price index rose by 2.3% in the year to April 2000. This is substantially lower than both the headline rate of inflation and the increases in social welfare payments announced in the recent budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of increase in food prices has slowed substantially since the beginning of 1999. The rate of increase fell from a peak of 4.8% in February 1999 to 2.9% by the end of the year. This decrease mainly reflected falls in the prices of <Col N="619" /> potatoes and fresh fruit and vegetables as supply conditions improved in 1999 following poor harvests in 1998.</P>
    <P>Food inflation has continued to moderate this year, from 2.9% in January to 2.3% in April, reflecting falls in the prices of fruit and vegetables and more modest price increases for bread and bakery products and other processed food. Increases in meat and dairy product prices continue to be substantially lower than headline inflation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>The capital commitments of the Midland Health Board area, including County Westmeath, includes a wide range of projects and other initiatives across all healthcare areas. These relate also to initiatives that carried forward into 2000 from previous years.</P>
      <P>Given the extent of the programme, and the fact that much of the minor capital expenditure is administered by the health boards and my Department on a global rather than an itemised basis, it would not be practical for me to detail all such capital expenditure. Examples of major capital projects that were previously scheduled for the Westmeath area, or are expected to commence this year under National Development Plan funding, include: planning work on Mullingar General Hospital &ndash; Phase II; upgrading at St. Loman's Hospital; purchase of property to replace Carberry Lodge, Athlone; development of respite services at Mullingar; development of health services infrastructure, Athlone.</P>
      <P>The capital programme for this year also includes an additional £8 million that I recently made available to the board for the important areas of re-equipment and refurbishment works. This sum will be prioritised by the board for the acute hospital and non-acute hospitals areas throughout the region. Other possible capital initiatives for this year under the National Development Plan will be considered on an individual basis by the board and my Department to take account of normal criteria governing capital projects. These relate, for example, to agreement on costings, timing and priority of projects. The question of new or extended service provision will also be examined in detail in the context of NDP priorities.</P>
      <P>In general, the question of what projects are funded this year in the County Westmeath area, and the extent to which they are funded, depends on the drawdown by the board for individual projects within its overall capital programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is a significant level of public awareness of the importance of blood donations in the treatment of patients in our hospitals. Patients who undergo major surgery regularly depend on blood transfusions and patients who have been diagnosed with certain forms of cancers also rely on blood transfusions as an essential element of their ongoing treatment.</P>
      <P>In this country approximately 100,000 donors give blood annually. I have met blood donors since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children and I am fully aware of their pride in supporting people in need and in their practical commitment to donating blood on a regular basis despite the time and inconvenience involved. I acknowledge their major contribution to improving the health of so many patients and to sustaining important elements of our hospital services.</P>
      <P>Transfusion services internationally continue to experience difficulties in meeting the demand for blood. As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board has experienced difficulties in recent weeks in ensuring that there are adequate blood supplies available to meet all hospital requirements. In Ireland, for example, we have one of the highest deferral rates internationally as approximately 16% of those who attend donor clinics are deferred and not accepted as donors at least temporarily. In recent weeks the IBTS has implemented a major campaign through the media at national and local levels to advise of blood supply difficulties and to encourage more donors to come forward and attend local blood collection clinics. Donors have responded generously to this campaign and I am pleased to advise that the IBTS has sufficient stocks available to meet hospital needs over the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Constant effort is needed to maintain donations at an adequate level to meet service needs and to manage seasonal variations in blood supply. I would encourage donors to continue to give blood on a regular basis particularly over the summer months when the level of donations tends to decrease due to holiday commitments. Approximately, 15,000 new donors are required on an annual basis and I would also encourage new donors to come forward and replace donors who retire or are unable to continue to donate.</P>

      <Quest>further to his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 90 of 25 May 2000, the most recent year when dentists were trained to become orthodontists in the Southern Health Board region; the number of dentists that were trained at the time; the reason no such training is taking place at present; the plans he has to take action in order to enable such training to recommence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand from the Southern Health Board that up to April 1999, the board had a training programme to train two orthodontists to consultant level but following an inspection by the specialist advisory committee for orthodontic training, recognition for specialist training was withdrawn. Two trainee orthodontists were in training at the time.</P>
      <P>I have recently given my consent to the Dental Council for the creation of a specialist register in orthodontics. The Dental Council must satisfy itself as to the acceptability of training programmes for entry to the specialist register.</P>
      <P>The Dental Council is currently engaged in consultation with all interest groups regarding a framework for dental specialist training in this country. This process will be completed by September of this year. I understand that all regional orthodontic centres will be invited to participate in the training programmes.</P>
      <P>As part of this process I will be advising the Dental Council of the urgent need for 30 trained specialists in orthodontics in the public dental service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government recognises that persons with disabilities, including those with autism, have the same fundamental rights as any other group in our society. This includes the right to participate fully in the social, economic, political and cultural activities of their communities. Recognition of that right is vital if an inclusive society is to be achieved in which everybody can contribute their experiences, talents and abilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of health and social services to person with an intellectual disability and those with autism are based, within the limits of available resources, on a recognition of the right of <Col N="624" /> persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism to quality services which respect their dignity, are provided within the least restrictive environment and aim at the greatest possible inclusion in society; the development of services in accordance with the principles underpinning the United Nations Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with a Disability; and the principles of equity, quality of services and accountability and the concept of health and social gain which underpin the health strategy.</P>
    <P>These principles are in keeping with those outlined in the Charter of Rights for Persons with Autism referred to by the Deputy. This charter was adopted by the European Parliament in 1996 and was forwarded to the Governments of all the member states. I understand that it was also widely circulated to other interested parties at that time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Irish Society for Autism, I understand that the society has been working with the health boards over the past number of years in the provision of services for persons with autism. Decisions in relation to the allocation of funding for new developments in services to persons with disabilities are a matter for individual health boards and are taken in line with the priorities which have been identified for each region through the established planning and consultative structures. It is important, therefore, that the society continues to liaise, on an on-going basis, with the health boards and the planning and consultative committees to ensure that the necessary services are being provided to meet the identified priority needs of those with autism in the regions.</P>

Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital.</P>
      <P>The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of either being private to the consultant or by obtaining a private bed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The question of introducing a scheme whereby certain categories of dog owners could obtain a dog licence at a reduced rate has been examined. While it is recognised that a dog can provide both a sense of security and companionship to many elderly people and to people living alone, it would not, unfortunately, be feasible to introduce such a scheme without incurring substantial administrative costs and a loss of revenue to the local authorities, who rely on the revenue from the sale of dog licences to finance their dog control activities. At a practical level also, such a scheme would give rise to difficulties for local authorities in attempting to establish the true ownership of a dog which was covered by a reduced fee licence but which was being kept by a person who was not eligible for such a licence.</P>
      <P>There is no reliable data available on the existing dog population in Ireland. In 1999 a total of 157,010 dog licences and 197 general dog licences were issued.</P>
      <P>The Control of Dogs (Amendment) Act, 1992, together with revised and consolidated regulations, were brought into effect on 1 February 1999. The increase in dog licence fees provided for in the Act will increase revenue to local authorities to fund their dog control activities and should lead to improved levels of enforcement. My Department will monitor progress in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a basic principle of the national guidelines on Public Procurement, 1994 edition, and EU Public Procurement Directives that competitive tendering should generally be used for construction works. For major construction projects, the tendering options normally used by local authorities, and other bodies under the aegis of my Department, are: (a) open tendering &ndash; where all interested contractors may tender; or (b) two stage selective tendering &ndash; stage one being the pre-qualification of firms for a particular project, and stage two being the invitation of tenders from pre-qualified contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advertisements seeking tenders in the national and/or local newspapers are a basic part of either tendering option. In the case of projects with a <Col N="628" /> value in excess of £4.2 million, excluding VAT, advertisements are also placed in the Official Journal of the European Community (OJEC).</P>
    <P>EU Public Procurement Directives apply to construction projects with an estimated value in excess of £4.2 million, excluding VAT. The basic Directive 71/305/EEC of 26 July 1971 was amended on a number of occasions and subsequently consolidated into Directive 93/37/EEC of 14 June 1993. The 1993 directive was amended by Directive 97/52/EC of 13 October 1997. My Department has not yet received the public procurement guidelines of 16 May 2000 referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and bodies under the aegis of my Department have been issued with copies of all EU Public Procurement Directives and have been asked to ensure that the provisions of the EU directives are complied with on all occasions. I should add that tender award decisions of local authorities are subject to independent audit by the Local Government Audit Service and, in the case of EU funded projects, by EU auditors.</P>
    <P>Unsuccessful tenderers are entitled, on request, to a written explanation as to why their firm did not pre-qualify or why their tender was not accepted. Under the EU Remedies Directive (89/665/EEC of 21 December 1989), an unsuccessful bidder is also entitled to challenge the award of a public works contract in the courts.</P>

This issue was considered in the past and it was found that a tenant purchase scheme for rental subsidy housing would not be feasible as the sale of individual housing would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Residents of rental subsidy houses of more than one year's duration who wish to become owner-occupiers may, however, on surrendering their house to the approved body, qualify for the following benefits available to local authority tenants surrendering their houses to the authority: special mortgage allowance of £4,500 over five years to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership system without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria; improvement works in lieu; low cost housing sites, and <Col N="629" /> exemption from the income limit for local authority housing loans.</P>

      <P>The scheme of thatching grants operated by my Department was introduced to assist in the renewal and repair of traditional thatched roofs. Last year I introduced significant improvements to the grant levels under the scheme. The basic maximum grant was increased from £2,400 to £3,000 and from £3,600 to £4,500 for houses on specified offshore islands. Grants are available to meet two-thirds of the approved cost of works, subject to the maximum limits.</P>
      <P>I also introduced a new measure to assist lower income households, for whom the cost of maintaining a thatched roof imposes a particular burden. Householders with medical cards are eligible for thatching grants up to a maximum of £5,000 or £6,500 in the case of the specified offshore islands. In addition, in such cases the grant may cover up to 80% of the approved cost of the works subject to the maximum grant limits.</P>
      <P>Housing grants for Gaeltacht areas are administered separately by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I understand that the £5,500 grant referred to by the Deputy is the level of grant available for the renewal and repair of thatched roofs in Gaeltacht areas and, accordingly, is not available generally in the west of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement by Advanta Seeds UK Limited on 17 May 2000 that some batches of seed of one of its non-genetically modified oilseed rape varieties had tested positive for a very low level of genetically modified rape, my Department requested the Environmental Protection Agency, in its capacity as competent authority for Council Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms to the environment and in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to review and report on the position in Ireland. That review is ongoing and I expect to have the agency's report as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>While my Department has had no contact with the seed company concerned, it has been advised by the EPA that, in the agency's initial contact with the company, the agency's understanding was that Ireland was unlikely to have been affected by the contaminated seed. As of now, that position is unchanged in terms of both the sale and cultivation of the seed on a commercial basis. However, EPA has indicated that on 26 May 2000, the agency learned from the seed company that 2kg of seed which originated from the stock now known to show traces of genetically modified material were supplied to an Irish seed company in 1998. This seed was submitted to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for variety trial purposes. I expect that the EPA's report, in the context of the agency's responsibilities for environmental protection, will address all relevant aspects of the use of this seed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has for a number of years operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000, my Department was committed to identifying 30 new priority areas for inclusion in the community development programme. The technical group, established to advise me on areas and groups to be supported under the various programmes, first gathered baseline information on levels of disadvantage and poverty. In this regard the group had available to it the report Targeting Disadvantage under the Community Development Programme, which was commissioned at its request by the Combat Poverty Agency. The report ranked all areas of the State in terms of comparative disadvantage. Further research was undertaken by the regional support agencies funded under the community development programme to further identify the priority areas for assistance under the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this targeting exercise, locally-based community groups can make direct application to my Department seeking inclusion in these programmes. In assessing any such applications the technical group takes account of avail<Col N="634" /> able research and data to ensure that assistance under the programmes is targeted at the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>My Department undertakes research in relation to policy issues both internally and externally through consultants commissioned to undertake analysis on its behalf. In addition to such research, targeting of assistance under my Department's programmes is informed by the research conducted by a number of agencies, including the Combat Poverty Agency. In this regard the Combat Poverty Agency receives funding in excess of £2 million per annum and has within its remit the examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and can commission research for that purpose. At present the Combat Poverty Agency is engaged in a pilot project with South Dublin County Council and Sligo County Council which will attempt to collate data, at district electoral division level, which can be used to create poverty profiles for local areas. Departments, representatives of local authorities, and the small area health research unit in Trinity College are also involved in this initiative.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness also provides that research will be carried out in a number of key areas, including poverty, health, education and training. In relation to the monitoring and evaluation of poverty, further research to determine the extent and causes of poverty will be carried out and systems of measuring poverty among groups not currently included will also be examined &ndash; people living in institutions, travellers and the homeless. The programme also provides for new studies to complement the current living in Ireland and household budget surveys, and to address the gender dimensions of poverty.</P>
    <P>In the areas of health, education and training, the Central Statistics Office, the Equality Authority and relevant Departments will develop a system for the collection and dissemination of desegregated data for women and, in relation to health, education and training, for travellers.</P>
    <P>In addition, resources are to be allocated to health research as part of a comprehensive approach to ensuring adequate medium and long-term planning of health provision. Data systems will be adapted to enable desegregation of health access and outcomes across the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, target groups.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the above research will help to inform the targeting of funding at areas of high deprivation.</P>

      <P>The focus of these programmes is on providing support to locally-based community groups involved in anti-poverty work within their communities by supporting these communities to develop their capacity to change their situation for the better, to enable them to participate in society and have a real say in their own development.</P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000, my Department was committed to identifying 30 new priority areas for inclusion in the community development programme. The technical group which advises me on areas for expansion of the programmes, first gathered baseline information on levels of disadvantage and poverty. In this regard the group had available to it, the report Targeting Disadvantage under the Community Development Programme, which was commissioned at its request by the Combat Poverty Agency. The report ranked all areas of the State in terms of comparative disadvantage. Further research was undertaken by the regional support agencies funded under the community development programme to further identify the priority areas for assistance under the programmes.</P>
      <P>This targeting exercise identified Ballincarrigy, County Westmeath, as a priority area for assistance under the programmes. The regional support agency for the midlands region will be undertaking the necessary work to establish a project in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current expansion of the community development support programmes represents a very high increase in the number of funded projects to come on stream over the next 18 months or so. It involves a considerable concentration of development work by this Department and the regional support agencies during that period. <Col N="636" /> Increased funding for the future expansion of the community development support programmes has been addressed in both the national development plan and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The programmes will receive £100 million over the lifetime of the national development plan. This is some £2 to £4 million more per annum than the 1999 provision.</P>
    <P>Further expansion in the number of community development support programme projects falls to be considered within the parameters of the national development plan funding envelope, when the current expansion has been consolidated. Once the new projects are up and running the technical group will be revisiting priority needs for the future expansion of the programmes.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have responsibility for a capital programme under the national development programme.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mort<Col N="637" /> gage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation.</P>
      <P>Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded a retirement pension of £89 per week, an increase of £15.50 on his previous pre-retirement allowance. His rent also increased by £0.50 per week at this time. The amount of rent supplement payable was accordingly reduced by £15, the net increase in his means from £23.30 to £8.30.</P>
      <P>In May 2000 the person concerned received a budget increase of £7 in his weekly pension. As the increase was £3 greater than the corresponding increase in the basic rate of SWA this resulted in a further reduction of this amount in the rent supplement bringing it to the current rate of £5.30.</P>
      <P>This manner of calculation of rent supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has been established to carry out the review and a report is expected by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Any proposals for changes in this area would also have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a <i>pro-rata</i> invalidity pension of £55.30 per week. She was originally awarded full rate invalidity pension based on a combination of her Irish and United Kingdom social insurance contribution records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations provide that an invalidity pension <Col N="638" /> can only be paid on a combined Irish and UK social insurance record until such time as the person reaches UK retirement age which in this case is 60 years of age.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, with effect from 4 October 1997, the person concerned was no longer entitled to be paid full rate invalidity pension. However, she continued to be paid her invalidity pension until a <i>pro-rata </i>pension was paid from 22 July 1999. She may also be entitled to a UK retirement pension from age 60 and has been advised to apply for that pension.</P>
    <P>Her current entitlement to invalidity pension is based on her insurance record which shows a total of 219 paid reckonable contributions. She was informed of the position regarding her invalidity pension and advised to apply for a UK retirement pension on two occasions, in April 1999 and again in May 1999, prior to the award of her pro-rata invalidity pension.

      <P>The deciding officer considered her claim and was of the view that she was not genuinely seeking work and, accordingly, disallowed her claim. The person concerned appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. On the basis of all the evidence, the appeals officer disallowed her appeal. The decision of an appeals officer can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Deputy's recent representations, the papers in the case will be referred for further consideration by the appeals officer and the person concerned will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who was in receipt of disability allowance at the maximum rate of £114.70 per week reached pension age on 6 January 2000.</P>
      <P>He was awarded a pension of £92.70 per week with effect from 7 January 2000. This amount comprised a personal rate of £58.50 and an increase of £34.20 in respect of his wife. This was based on a means assessment of £25.96 a week, deriving from the estimated capital value (£40,000) of a second property owned by him.</P>
      <P>His spouse was subsequently awarded a carer's allowance in her own right at the maximum rate. Consequently the qualified adult allowance payable to the person concerned as part of his pension was discontinued. The capital value of the second property has now been assessed by the valuation office at £80,000. Based on this value the person concerned is entitled to an old age non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £9.50. This is the rate appropriate to his means, assessed in full accordance with the rules set out in the legislation governing this scheme.</P>
      <P>A deciding officer's decision will shortly issue to the person concerned and he will be informed regarding his right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. His means will be reviewed again later this year in the context of the improved capital assessment rules provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 2000. On the basis of his current means, the person concerned will be entitled to pension at the rate of £21.50 per week with effect from 13 October 2000.</P>
      <P>In determining means, there are no provisions in the legislation to take account of the claimant's medical condition.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility for the protection of the architectural heri<Col N="644" /> tage rests with the local authorities who now have considerable powers to protect any buildings listed by them. In addition, they also are responsible for the allocation of £4 million per annum for a conservation grant scheme for architecturally important buildings. These mechanisms are important for the protection of heritage buildings throughout the country and I assist this work by offering an expert advisory service to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>There are other initiatives which also assist in the protection and restoration of heritage buildings. The owner or occupier of a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>

It is not the practice to categorise national monuments as ancient forts. At present a guide information service is provided at 67 State-maintained heritage sites. In 1999 a total of 2.3 million fee-paying visitors were attracted to the 58 sites where an admission fee is charged while very many more visited those where no fee is charged. I have arranged for free admission for school tours to heritage sites. It is intended to develop further State-maintained heritage sites in the context of the national development plan and priorities for such development are being determined at present. New or enhanced visitor centres will be provided at some sites while interpretative panels will be provided at many more to assist in the understanding of the site by the visitor.   </P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, a nationwide survey is currently being carried out by my Department to help identify structures and buildings which are of architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. An interim survey covering County Kildare will be completed within the next two years.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>The pension scheme operated by my Department for non-established State employees is that which has been sanctioned by the Department of Finance, for application to non-established employees in all Departments. It should be borne in mind that the scheme is non-contributory and that employees also qualify for entitlement to the State contributory old age pension. My Department also facilitates the operation of additional voluntary contribution schemes which are organised by various trade unions. Any revision of the current scheme is not a matter for my Department in isolation, but rather is an issue for consideration by the appropriate national negotiating body, the National Joint Industrial Council for State Employees, which operates under the aegis of the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>In the particular case instanced by the Deputy, the employee concerned would have less than 38 years service at maximum age retirement, 66. His pension entitlements are calculated on the basis of his pensionable remuneration and reckonable service. This person has recently been correctly advised of his estimated entitlements to pension and pension lump sum, based on current pay rates and an assumption that all of his service is reckonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>Funding of approximately £365 million has been allocated to my Department in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>My Department's equal opportunities child care programme has been allocated £250 million to invest in the development of child care service provision. On 28 April last, I launched capital and staffing grant measures under the programme and, to date, almost 3,000 requests for application forms have been received. There is no closing date for applications as the programme is being operated on an open ended basis. It is not possible to say at this stage how many projects will be funded in any county during 2000.</P>
      <P>My Department has been allocated a sum of £23.2 million for positive actions targeted at women. The plan provides for positive actions to tackle vertical and horizontal segregation in the labour market and for the development of family friendly initiatives. There will also be a focus on addressing the needs of women in the home who are seeking to avail of labour market opportunities, supporting gender balance in decision making and assisting disadvantaged women. In addition, my Department has been allocated £4 million for a gender equality and monitoring unit to mainstream equal opportunities between men and women across the national development plan. There is no capital element to these measures. The location of projects for year 2000 has yet to be finalised.</P>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a programme to prepare prisoners for employment after their release. The programme is an expansion of an existing activity which has been taking place over a number of years in the prisons and it is based on a pilot research project which has been carried out within the last two years with EU funding. This is a co-ordinated programme within the National Development Plan, both as regards the agencies within my own Department &ndash; the prisons and probation services and the Garda Síochána and with other State bodies working in this field. The total expenditure on work and training that is planned in prisons is approximately £46 million. There is no provision in the prison services training and development programme of the national development plan either for services or capital expenditure for implementation in 2000 specifically located in County Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The probation and welfare service of my Department has been allocated funding under the national development plan of almost £25 million. The proposal in respect of this funding will target a number of groups such as those under 25 years <Col N="651" /> who have been before the courts and are likely to reoffend and become long-term unemployed. Another target group will be women, particularly young women with drug problems and those with families whose lives are disrupted, for example, by domestic violence. The projects to be developed under this programme relate to developments across the regions as needs apply and will cater for those referred to the Probation and Welfare Service by the courts as well as those receiving custodial sentences. The Probation and Welfare Service has identified Athlone for the establishment of a day probation centre under this programme. A time frame for the provision of the centre has not yet been decided but I can confirm that no capital expenditure will arise this year in respect of this centre. Support services will be provided in tandem with the centre.</P>
    <P>Funding of £16 million has been allocated for a significant expansion of the Garda youth diversion development programme. The projects in this programme aim, through a combination of intervention and preventative actions, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal activity and its consequences. The long-term objective is to enable the target group of ten to 18 year olds to integrate into the labour force and to enhance their employment prospects. It is proposed to expand the number of projects on a phased basis over the life of the plan. At the beginning of this month I announced that Athlone is also selected as a location for one of ten projects to be established in the first phase of the programme later this year. There is no capital element to these measures.</P>

      <P>I have recently obtained Government approval to examine the feasibility of constructing a bridge from the mainland side of Haulbowline Bridge to Spike Island.</P>
      <P>Indicative costings for the proposed bridge are in the order to £8 million to £10 million. At present, a ferry and barge service is provided by a private company at an annual cost of £400,000 approximately. The provision of the bridge would also achieve savings in relation to staff costs, £80,000 per annum approximately at present, and the costs, 33.3% premium approximately, for all prison construction, refurbishment and maintenance works on the island and supplies and deliveries to the island. Prison service officials estimate the savings involved to be of the order of £750,000 per annum excluding payments for the new bridge.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study will cover not only construction, but also the various financial options by way of public private partnerships available which will project the possible lease back costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, which was published in November 1999, contains provisions totalling £862 million for programmes which will be of concern to my Department over the next seven years. Specifically, there will be £357 million for investment in tourism marketing, training and product, £85 million for additional investment in regional recreational and sport infrastructure and £420 million for local development initiatives under the social inclusion sub-programme, targeted at disadvantaged communities, drugs and young people at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation arrangements have still to be finalised in agreement with the European <Col N="653" /> Commission, so it is not possible to identify services or capital programmes under the aegis of my Department on a county-constituency basis.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, local drugs task forces have been set up in areas which are experiencing the highest levels of drug use, in particular where heroin abuse is most prevalent. The Ballyfermot local drugs task force, which comprises representatives from key State agencies and local community and voluntary groups, has been mandated to develop an integrated response to the drug problem in the Ballyfermot-Cherry Orchard area. The task force received an earlier allocation of £922,000 to implement its original action plan, which contained a comprehensive range of measures to support drug users and their families. They are currently updating this plan and I am arranging for the study to be brought to their attention for consideration in that context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" />
      <i>Lifelong learning, £1,085 million.</i>The funding for the lifelong learning measures in the education sector provides for the back-to-education-initiative (including VTOS, Youthreach and post-leaving certificate courses). Further education supports, including guidance and counselling, and the modern languages initiative.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Quality improvement, £126 million.</i>The above includes provision for the in-career development of primary and post-primary teachers, quality assurance in the third-level system, including training of trainers, the national qualifications system and certification.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Equal opportunities, £19.6 million.</i>Provision is being made under the national development plan for three specific elements, the educational disadvantage measure, equal opportunities promotion and monitoring and the provision of child care support for participants in programmes within the education sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Youth services, £165.8 million.</i>The above includes funding to facilitate the continuation of the existing range of youth work services under the aegis of this Department.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Research, technological, development and innovation, £550 million.</i>This investment which builds on the current initiatives to improve R&amp;D capability in the third-level institutions is the largest ever targeted investment in favour of R&amp;D in education.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education infrastructure, £1,600 million.</i>This represents the largest ever multi-annual commitment to investment in the improvement of our education infrastructure at primary, post-primary and third level with significant front loading in the earlier years of the programme.</P>
    <P>All mainstream programmes in the education sector are delivered on a national basis. Specific programmes with the aim of combating social exclusion, are targeted at areas of educational disadvantage, on the basis of priority of need, in accordance with established criteria, irrespective of urban-rural status. Apart from participating in programmes delivered in their county, the population of County Westmeath, may also access programmes delivered elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, includes provision of £1.6 billion for capital expenditure in the education sector. This will cover investment in primary and post-primary schools, further education centres and third-level institutions, representing the largest ever multi-annual commitment to investment in the improvement of our education infrastructure. In addition, there is an overall provision of £550 million for a research, technological development and innovation fund in the education sector, which includes funding to promote the development of world-class research infrastructure and equipment in third-level institutions, thereby providing the foundation upon which research excellence can be developed.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy with regard to capital projects is not available. The allocation of funding to capital projects by my Department depends on factors such as the rate of progress of architectural design, site acquisition, the granting of planning permission and the outcome of the tender process. Delays can arise at any stage of the process, consequently, it is not possible to say when projects being processed at present will proceed to construction. If the Deputy requires information on individual building projects, I will be happy to provide the details.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the process of the preparation of the Education (Welfare) Bill and its enactment, I received a number of representations from parents who wish to educate their children at home and officials of my Department met with a number of groups representing such parents and discussed their concerns.</P>
      <P>An appropriate education in childhood has never been more central to and necessary for the development and future personal fulfilment of a person. The preference of the vast majority of parents is to send their children to a recognised school for their education. These schools are regulated by the Education Act, 1998, staffed by professional teachers and provide a high quality education to their students. Notwithstanding the availability of such schools, some parents exercise their right as parents and under the Constitution to educate their children at home or in schools other than recognised schools. In this situation it must be borne in mind that the children concerned also have a constitutional right the right to be educated. Finally I, as Minister for Education and Science, have a constitutional obligation to ensure that the children concerned receive at least a minimum education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill has been drafted in the context of these three constitutional imperatives and it provides balanced and proportionate provisions to reflect the rights and obligations of all. The right of parents to educate <Col N="657" /> their children at home is acknowledged. In order to ensure that children are being educated there is a requirement on parents to register their children as being educated other than in a recognised school. In furtherance of the State's obligation to ensure that the children are receiving at least a minimum education there are provisions for assessment of the education provided and the laying down of guidelines as to what constitutes minimum education.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, and in response to representations I received, I introduced an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to avoid excessive interference with a family's right to privacy while at the same time ensuring the child's right to a minimum education. The Bill now provides for a more flexible system to assess whether children are receiving a minimum education which allows for a less intensive scrutiny of the methods of education to be used in educating the child in question and for consultation with the parents. Only where the person carrying out the assessment is not satisfied that a minimum education is being provided to the child in question will a more intensive assessment be made. As it stands, the Bill now proposes a flexible framework, designed to accommodate the rights of parents and to ensure as far as practicable that the rights and needs of children are respected and provided for.</P>

      <P>Safety on school buses is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard. I should also mention that the age profile and quality of vehicle of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann's maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann school bus fleet was refurbished during summer 1999.</P>
      <P>All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are subject to a roadworthiness test. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test.</P>
      <P>Contractors employed by Bus Éireann to provide services under the school transport scheme must satisfy strict criteria and must hold a road passenger operator's licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vehicles nominated for use under the scheme <Col N="659" /> must be suitable for the conveyance of school children and must have complete and current documentation in respect of both buses and drivers as required by law. This includes a PSV licence, certificate of roadworthiness, certificate of insurance and tax disc. Drivers must have a valid driving licence for the class of vehicle to be <Col N="660" /> driven. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and to comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts. Vehicles must be kept clean internally and externally to the satisfaction of Bus Éireann. Contractor's vehicles are subject to inspection and testing by Bus Éireann inspectors from time to time to ensure the safety of pupils travelling on buses.</P>
