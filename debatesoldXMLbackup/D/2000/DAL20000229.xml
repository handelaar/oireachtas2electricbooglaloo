      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have explained on a number of occasions the arrangements that are in place in my office to deal with the Independent Deputies who support the Government. As I confirmed before, a staff member in my office assists the Chief Whip's office in its work with these Deputies, which includes regular meetings. I also meet them from time to time in my office and arrange to keep them briefed on issues and assist in arranging meetings with Ministers as the need arises.</P>
      <P>In the case of Deputy Foley, I confirm to the Dáil that in his letter of resignation sent to the Chief Whip he undertook to continue to support the Government. No other arrangements are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that <Col N="558" /> recently, since Deputy Foley ceased to be a member of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government refused to meet a cross-party delegation from Kerry County Council but met a Fianna Fáil delegation which included Deputy Foley? In light of this decision does the Taoiseach think it would be right for a Deputy such as Deputy Foley, who is an undischarged tax evader, to be a Fianna Fáil candidate at the next election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister for the Environment met a group of Fianna Fáil councillors &ndash; it was not a question of a delegation that he refused to meet; it was a group of Fianna Fáil County Councillors which I do not think around be unusual for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It included Deputy Foley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. He is a councillor and a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and therefore I do not think that was unusual. What happens Deputy Foley ultimately is a matter for the party's national executive, his constituency organisation and will also depend on the findings of the report. The parliamentary party has stated that on the conclusion of the Moriarty tribunal it will reach a conclusion on members inside and outside the parliamentary party and within the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to know the Taoiseach's opinion. Does he think it is right to put up a tax evader as a party candidate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>That is ridiculous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have a view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have plenty of views which I put on the record of the House two weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>How about the Deputy's best friend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not stand as a Fine Gael candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My views about tax evaders were placed on the record of the House two weeks ago. Let us wait until the report is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's views on this matter are not on the record. Does the Taoiseach believe it would be right for his party, in view of its standards, for someone who is an admitted and undischarged tax evader to be put forward as a standard bearer for Fianna Fáil in an election? Does the Taoiseach believe this is right or wrong? It is a simple question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="559" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not relevant to the question. My views on this issue are on the record of the House. Unlike Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil has a code of practice which states what the party thinks of tax evaders and we will stick by our rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall whether the Taoiseach said Deputy Foley is included in the group of Independent Deputies for which special provision is made in terms of their servicing requirements in the House. I wish to ask the Taoiseach about equality of treatment for Members in general. Are there other non-office holding Members who have such a special arrangement made for them? If a senior civil servant is appointed to mind Independent Deputies, then surely it can be argued that such an appointment is required by other groups of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Foley is not included in that group and there is not a particular arrangement with him whatsoever other than what I stated in the reply. He does not attend any of the meetings with the Government Whip, but he has only departed from the parliamentary party in recent weeks. In a democracy it is unreasonable for a party or people who are not members of the Government parties but who support it to seek meetings with the Government to find out what they are supporting. It is normal for the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party to discuss legislation at a meeting on Wednesdays. The Progressive Democrats also meets on Wednesday. If the Government expects support from other Deputies, then those Deputies are entitled to be briefed and to know what they are voting on, and this is what happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that job cannot be performed adequately by the Government Whip in whom he has such confidence? If a group because of its independent status requires that kind of back-up, what is the implication of Deputy Foley not being included in it? Is he not an Independent after all? Does he still have a special arrangement with Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point in me replying if the Deputy does not listen. I said that there was no particular arrangement and Deputy Foley does not attend the meetings of Independent Members. It is a matter for him whether he seeks that facility in due course. He said that he is supporting the Government, but he has no particular arrangement and does not attend those meetings. I also said that the official from my office assists the Government Chief Whip in his functions. The Deputy will recall, when he was a member of another party in the House, that it demanded quite special arrangements when it only had a group of six. I do not think it is unreasonable for a group of four which supports the Government to also seek briefings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="560" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Foley is not availing of the special arrangements for Independent Members, is it the case that he is able to avail of the special arrangements available to Government Members in regard to representations on Government business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume Deputy Foley is doing what every Member of the House is doing, keeping in touch with Departments. Any Member of the Government or Opposition can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that arrangements are available to Members on the Government side in regard to business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no great, special arrangements. It is not unusual for members of the Opposition to make requests of Ministers or me on individual issues. That courtesy has been available as long as I have been in the House, whether one is in government or opposition, and I hope it continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If, therefore, Deputy Foley is not treated as an Independent Member, is it not the case that he is, in effect, still a Fianna Fáil Member and that his resignation of the whip simply means that he does not have to turn up at particular meetings on Wednesday mornings, which probably enables him to do more constituency work? He has suffered nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be the way it operates in the Deputy's party, that is his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieWade" hpid="Mr. Wade Mr. Wade">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade</NameTxt>
      <P>It is small enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking about the Taoiseach's party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not how our political party operates. People feel very privileged and honoured and wish to be members of the parliamentary party. Everybody in our organisation who runs for election wants to be a member of the parliamentary party. We consider losing the party whip to be a severe penalty. That is the way it always has been and will continue to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to draw inferences from what the Taoiseach has said. Does he consider that, logically, conclusions may be drawn from the fact that Independent Members, with no disrespect to them, who pay little interest to the legislative programme and so on other than as it becomes controversial, require specialist back-up? Virtually no specialist provision is made for Opposition parties, yet they are required to scrutinise legislation. Does the Taoiseach think a reasonable argument can be made that it is time to examine this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We could get carried away with specialist treatment. It consists of one meeting a week lasting approximately one hour where <Col N="561" /> people can follow something up or be made aware of something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It consists of a senior civil servant walking around town with a mobile telephone in his pocket in case he receives a telephone call about headage payments in the hills of Kerry to which he gives a reply immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Now he must also give replies for the plains of Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, he must deal with north and south Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about legislation but is now talking about constituency issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach hear any of the Independent Members in the House over the past two and a half years contributing to legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Deputy know that they are not listening to the monitors in their offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea what they might be listening to. They could also listen to 98FM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is so supercilious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Independent Members play their role. Last week I was accused by the Sinn Féin Member of not acknowledging people's mandates in the House. If one expects people to support the Government, it is not unreasonable for people to be briefed and to have some contact. That is what happens and it is entirely appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have not yet had any communications with Mr. Ivico Racan, the new Croatian Prime Minister, who has been in office for just over a month.</P>
      <P>The programme for my visit to East Timor is still being finalised, but I expect to meet the Special Representative of the Secretary General, Mr. Sergio de Mello, and other UN figures as well as East Timorese leaders, Mr. Xanana Gusmao, and Mr. Jose Ramos Horta. A very important element of my visit will be a meeting with the Irish troops who are serving in East Timor with UNTAET. I will also meet Irish NGO workers in Dili.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Australia, I will meet the Governor General, Sir William Deane, and Prime Minister John Howard, as well as regional political and business leaders in the Northern Territories, Victoria and New South Wales. I have a number of economic engagements in Melbourne and Sydney to discuss trade, investment and tourism matters. I will inaugurate the new Ireland House in Sydney and will meet the governors of the Australian Ireland <Col N="563" /> Fund after delivering an address on Northern Ireland at the University of New South Wales. I will also meet representatives of the Irish community in each city I visit.</P>
    <P>I will travel to Australia by scheduled airline, accompanied by six officials. A small number of support staff will travel in advance to finalise arrangements, particularly with regard to East Timor. Due to the lack of scheduled air transport to East Timor, our party of seven will travel by chartered plane to Dili from Darwin. The Australian government will supply our transport within Australia. I will travel with a party of six by scheduled flights from Sydney to Los Angeles.</P>
    <P>The programme for my visit to the US is being finalised. I will travel from Los Angeles to Washington and back to Dublin by Government jet.</P>
    <P>On 17 February last, at the invitation of the world-wide President of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, I attended the CIPFA Annual Dinner in the Savoy Hotel, London. The dinner was attended by approximately 300 public finance and financial services agency personnel, including UK local and central government personnel, Welsh and Scottish Assembly representatives and representatives from the European Federation of Accountancy bodies.</P>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Guterres last night as part of his tour of capitals to discuss the content of the Special European Council which is taking place in Lisbon on 23-24 March. The Cabinet Committee on EU Affairs has already discussed the summit in detail at its last meeting on 8 February. No formal agenda has been made available in advance of the summit but in addition to my meeting Prime Minister Guterres, a series of correspondence papers and meetings have taken place between the Presidency and partners, including two special preparatory meetings in Lisbon and Brussels of Prime Ministers' representatives. Officials from my Department have held discussions around the general themes of employment, social exclusion and knowledge and innovation in the information society with visiting Portuguese, UK and Swedish delegations. I also hope to have my usual pre-summit meeting with Prime Minister Blair immediately in advance of Lisbon.</P>
    <P>In addition to the focus on employment, it is likely that other matters of a current nature will be discussed at the summit, and that the Presidency will wish to update partners on the Intergovernmental Conference and CFSP developments, both of which will be discussed in more detail at the June meeting of the European Council. An opportunity to review progress on the Charter of Fundamental Rights will also be available.</P>
    <P>At my meeting with Prime Minister Guterres, I outlined our belief in the need for a multi-faceted approach at Lisbon to the new challenges presented by the information society to create quality and sustainable employment in an econ<Col N="564" /> omy. Ireland broadly shares the objectives set forth by the Presidency, particularly as regards greater economic policy co-ordination and accelerating structural reform. I am glad to see the emphasis on pulling together the various processes which impact in this area.</P>
    <P>I emphasised to the Prime Minister that I would like Lisbon deliver in terms of process as I have mentioned but also in terms of product. By this I mean concrete initiatives such as the proposed charter for small business and the high level working group on social protection. I also hope Lisbon can produce longer term strategic messages about the competitiveness of Europe, particularly as regards the integration of e-commerce and new technologies into every facet of commercial life. I informed the Prime Minister that a national response from Ireland to the Presidency paper on the summit would be available shortly.</P>
    <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs has replaced the Ministers' and Secretaries General Group and will continue to meet monthly to discuss key issues on the EU agenda. The next meeting will be immediately in advance of my departure for the summit. I expect this meeting will also consider preparations for the Euro-African Cairo Summit which is scheduled to take place on 3 and 4 April. It has been agreed that the agenda for the first summit between the Heads of State or Government of the European Union and Africa will include economic and social, political and development issues. Preparatory meetings at official level are ongoing and I continue to follow developments closely. The summit is a historic and constructive step in the development of the EU's future relations with Africa. It will provide an excellent opportunity to further enhance the close links that already exist between us and develop our partnership for the future in a positive way.</P>
    <P>Following my visit to Lesotho and South Africa, I wrote to the President of the Commission and to members of the European Council in January proposing that the EU and the member states should explore what additional steps might be taken to address the challenge of HIV-AIDS in Africa. My letter mentioned that this year the Commission would assess the operations, financed under the existing Community regulations on HIV-AIDS, in developing countries. This assessment should provide a useful opportunity to revitalise the EU's approach to this issue. It will also be necessary to explore the scope for greater collective action by the EU and the member states and to review the level of resources currently committed to the fight against HIV-AIDS. My letter also raised the issue of access by the affected developing countries to generic rather than branded medicines for the treatment of AIDS at reasonable cost. I have also raised the matter with Commissioner Byrne.</P>
    <P>Since January there have been informal official level contacts with President Prodi's office and <Col N="565" /> with the relevant directorates in the Commission. I understand the Commission is preparing a comprehensive and detailed response to my initiative which has been positively received. I expect a formal reply from the Commission will be received this week.</P>
    <P>At the informal meeting of the Development Ministers in Lisbon on 27-28 January, Ireland raised the issue of the fight against AIDS. We again suggested that the Commission and the member states should consider how best the EU could collectively assist the most affected countries. Our intervention was received warmly and the Development Ministers singled out the HIV-AIDS issue as one of central importance to the future of development.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that, in preparation for the forthcoming Euro-African Cairo summit, EU member states including Ireland, are identifying the fight against HIV-AIDS as a priority for discussion with our African partners. This summit will provide a useful forum for a further expression of the international solidarity which is essential if the spread of HIV-AIDS is to be checked and those infected are to receive treatment.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks, we will continue to work with the Commission and with the member states with a view to promoting a more concerted and visible approach by the EU in the fight against the spread of HIV-AIDS in developing countries. Given the importance of the issue, I have suggested that, if necessary, it might be discussed at a future meeting of the European Council.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the position taken by the Portuguese Presidency that there should be no early restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the other 14 member states and Austria, notwithstanding the resignation of Mr. Jörg Haider as leader of the Freedom Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Cabinet meeting today I tried to assess what is being said around Europe. I discussed the matter briefly last night with Prime Minister Guterres. Mr. Haider's decision was a surprise and the general view is that people should wait to hear the reasons for his resignation. Personally, I welcome any reduction of Mr. Haider's influence, although we will have to wait to see the broader political picture. It is a change that he is no longer leader of the party and my quick assessment is that it should make a difference. However, as of this morning, member states are waiting to see the implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the position taken by the Portuguese Presidency that the key issue was not the personality of Mr. Haider but the nature of his party? If that is the case, what are the changes in the nature of the party that the Taoiseach wishes to see before he <Col N="566" /> regards that party as an acceptable participant in the government of a member state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the view from the start that the Austrian administration should be judged on its policies, declarations and actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I still believe that. I do not want to repeat what was said about this two weeks ago, but limited action was taken by member states. Some wished to take stronger action but Prime Minister Guterres managed to secure a compromise under which limited action was taken.</P>
      <P>The key issue will be how this government performs. In discussions with representatives of other countries I have continually made the point that the Austrian Government was asked by other states and by the Austrian President to include human rights issues in its preamble to government. It has done that. It had not intended to do it but it was pressured by the Austrian President. The coalition government agreed without much persuasion in the end, having resisted it for some weeks in the negotiation process.</P>
      <P>Mr. Haider has now resigned as the party leader and people are waiting to see the reasons for his resignation, the broader political issues and the influence he retains. I detect that a number of countries are reluctant to continue an enormous diplomatic battle with the Austrians but they are anxious to wait and see what happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that what is at issue here is the existence of a far right party invited into Government by the Christian Democratic Party in Austria whose views, notwithstanding the individual views of Mr. Haider, are inimical to the values espoused by the European Union? Does he agree the resignation of Mr. Haider and his affirmation today, as reported in the media, that he intends to continue to play a major role in national politics in Austria changes very little other than the cosmetics of the situation? Can the Taoiseach give an undertaking that he will continue to support the actions of the other 13 members of the European Union in respect of the sanction on the Austrian Government until such time as we are satisfied that by its deeds, rather than by its proclamations, it espouses fully the values of the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the decision. In reply to Deputy Bruton, we will have to see if the members of the European Community see this as a significant move. We heard rumours of his resignation at the start of the meeting with Prime Minister Guterres last night and they were more or less confirmed by the end of the meeting. Prime Minister Guterres was very surprised at the move as it was not something the Presidency believed would happen. It will be seen as significant but it will not change the position until <Col N="567" /> people are satisfied that its policies, declarations and actions comply&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the precedent set by the European Union in imposing sanctions against countries about which there are doubts about human rights abuses and xenophobic policies is a welcome advance? Does he agree that any such approach should be done on a uniform basis across all countries and not just in the case of smaller ones? Does he agree that one of the leading countries in advocating the most severe action in this instance was France? In light of that, is he aware that France is the only country in the European Union which has refused to accept a decision by the European Court of Human Rights in respect of an Algerian man who has been jailed for life? The man was not represented in the court and was sanctioned without his lawyer being present, and for the past two and a half years France has refused to recognise the decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. Does the Taoiseach agree that if there is to be consistency in the pursuit of human rights, countries such as France, and other big countries, should be sanctioned also for their failures in practical cases concerning immigrants? This case involves an immigrant who was sentenced to life imprisonment, without him or his lawyer being present, against the decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. In such circumstances, France should also be the subject of a sanction. The European Union should be uniform in pursuing rigorously the issue of human rights in all countries. Is the Taoiseach aware that France is the only member of the Council of Europe which refuses to accept the finding of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in a human rights case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is unusual and there could be implications with what the members of the European Community did, the policies articulated by Mr. Haider and others were in breach of the treaties and because of that there was no alternative but for member states to set down what they consider to be markers. I agree with the Deputy that the French were the driving force behind this but, having said that, we cannot ignore the abuse of human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limited action was taken in this case and that is consistent with standing by the elements of the Treaty. If the Austrian Administration follows <Col N="568" /> what it has inserted in the preamble to its programme for Government, which I hope it does, there should not be a difficulty. If it does not, then Article 6 will have to be examined by the Union. Let us look at it the other way around. What if nothing was put forward and the Austrian Administration had continued without the preamble? Some Austrian administrative officials might see it as unfair but outside pressure over that weekend led by the Portuguese Prime Minister, Antonio Guterres, who took a balanced view having sounded out all 14 member states, strengthened the hand of the President to include European humanitarian policies in the preamble. That was the correct course of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a separate but ultimately related matter, during the Taoiseach's proposed visit to Australia, does he intend to discuss with the Australian authorities their long experience in managing an immigration policy to address skills shortages in the domestic labour market, especially in light of the multicultural programme which they now run in that area? Is that matter a subject for discussion? If the Taoiseach learns anything, is he likely to convey it to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Regarding the case of an Algerian man who was sentenced <i>in abstentia</i> and without legal representation to life imprisonment, given that this is a unique case of a country defying the Council of Europe in which Ireland is now President of the Committee of Ministers and that the man in question is now on hunger strike in France and is likely to die, will the Taoiseach agree, if he is satisfied that the facts and the case are accurately described by me, which I assure him they are, to take up the matter with the French Prime Minister, Mr. Jospin, a socialist, and with President Chirac, an RPR representative, so that both can show their commitment to human rights is universal and that they are committed to human rights in France as well as in other parts of Europe?</P>

      <P>In respect of questions relating to the issue of AIDS in Africa and the Taoiseach's recent experience in Lesotho and South Africa, has he had any response to the correspondence he described in his first reply and, irrespective of what that response might be, does the Government, through its overseas development co-operation programmes, intend to initiate any bilateral programmes to deal with this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Quinn's earlier question about immigration policy, I have a list of events which I will forward to him.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of discussions with Commissioner Byrne and his officials. There are three parts to the process of which I would like to think my initiative in taking up the issue is a central part. There is much activity in this area. There is great concern about the HIV-AIDS issue which has recently been discussed by the UN. I brought the content of our discussion in this House on the drugs issue to the attention of the Commission which is putting together a comprehensive reply to the points made. It is also looking at the report of my visit to Lesotho and South Africa.</P>
      <P>We have published the HIV-AIDS strategy for the Ireland Aid Programme. It contains excellent documents and reports which set out in great detail what we should be doing. It deals with the issue in three central ways: the institutional response &ndash; to improve the awareness, responsiveness and effectiveness of Ireland Aid to HIV-AIDS as a development issue; the broad-based response &ndash; to protect the existing social economic development gains from the adverse effect of HIV-AIDS and to promote further development in these areas; and the specific response &ndash; to support sectoral policy programme activities which impact on the epidemic in the national community at individual level. The programme will feed directly into the areas being assisted by Ireland Aid, primarily, sub-Saharan Africa where the problem is greatest. Of the 33 million people in the world who have AIDS, 67% of them live in the African region. The majority of such people are under 24 years of age. The NGOs are focusing on the programme and trying to assist people in the three categories mentioned. We will also be increasing our resources for that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland Aid, as good as it is, will have to work <Col N="570" /> in tandem with the UN programme. I am trying to focus the discussions of the Cairo summit on the HIV-AIDS issue. We must not speak of economic development and other issues alone. We must recognise that 2.5 million people in Africa died of AIDS last year. That is a far greater number of people than those who died as a result of wars or from malaria. We must focus on that issue and I will attempt to do so at the forthcoming summit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that, in addition to the documentation to which the Taoiseach referred, from which he quoted, the Government is contemplating an additional allocation of resources to the programme based on his experience while visiting Lesotho and South Africa and the subsequent correspondence which he sent to the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, and others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are endeavouring to do. The reports prepared by the AIDS section of the Department of Foreign Affairs were not related to my visit but were related to work it is undertaking in particular areas. I do not know if Members have had an opportunity to look at the report, which is a very detailed policy of the Ireland Aid programme from the experience of Irish NGOs and Irish religious groups working on the front line not only in South Africa, Mozambique and other centres but in all the sub-Saharan regions. We are eminently in a good position to at least state the policy. We cannot resolve the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins was supported by everybody when he raised the drugs issue on a previous occasion. I am endeavouring to get the UN to encourage pharmaceutical companies to change their rules and regulations to allow them to assist in this problem which is out of control. I gave statistics earlier of the number of people who have died. Despite development aid in health care and child care and trying to improve the mortality of young people, the average age of death was reduced by 17 years in the 1990s alone. There is a crisis in sub-Saharan Africa and the Cairo summit should be used to focus on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are approximately 20 million people in sub-Saharan Africa with AIDS and approximately ten million children die annually in the Third World from easily preventable diseases. Has consideration been given to bypassing the annual Estimates procedure and legislating for Ireland to meet the 0.7% GNP contribution to development aid as set down by the UN?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not envisaged at this stage. However, we envisage developing a multiannual programme which will bring us to 0.45% in the short-term and to our UN commitment in the long-term. I recently outlined what that <Col N="571" /> means in money terms. We need to get to 0.45% as quickly as possible.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Taoiseach use the Cairo platform to publicly challenge the multinational drug companies because of their stranglehold on drugs which could alleviate the suffering to which he referred? It would be important to do so for the sake of the people who are suffering and dying.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe the EU's policy towards Austria will be an important feature of the special European Council? Does he agree that the EU is guilty of monumental hypocrisy in relation to the reactionary blue black coalition Government in Austria when the policies of many EU states mirror the incoming Austrian Government's policies in terms of privatisation programmes, cuts in public spending, attacks on pension rights of working people and immigration policies? I know Deputy John Bruton would not like me to use anything he says to back him up.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that what Deputy John Bruton said about France bears that out? The EU's hypocrisy has given rise to resentment in Austria. The only way to deal with Haider is by means of the 100,000 to 300,000 people who marched on the streets of Vienna on 19 February and the ongoing daily protests by workers and young people.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that racist statements made recently by Mr. Haider about the Turkish minority in Austria closely mirror statements made by one or two of his own backbenchers in the past 12 months? Will he condemn those statements as readily as he condemns Mr. Haider?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of proposals were presented to deal with the HIV-AIDS issue, including the possibility of establishing an international fund to purchase drugs and the establishment of a tripartite dialogue between donors, beneficiaries and private industry, including pharmaceutical companies, to provide a method of delivering the drugs to those who most need them. There is a strong case for the pharmaceutical companies to examine their commercial and intellectual property and to reduce the cost of these drugs to allow the poorest victims access to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles 5 and 6 of the Treaty of Europe are clear. Racist policies which are against human rights are not consistent with what the Community stands for. That is the reason Mr. Haider's policies were condemned. I do not recall hearing anyone, not least in this House, make the type of <Col N="572" /> statements made by Mr. Haider. I do not know if the Deputy has read any of his speeches, but I could give him some of them. They are not the type of speeches or statements that might be made here from time to time.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Taoiseach's reply that he will be travelling to Dili in East Timor. Do I anticipate that he will be announcing a substantial and sustained aid programme for that emerging state, which is at the stage where it can organise its own affairs? If so, when will details of the substantial Irish contribution be known?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already agreed in principle to open an office in Dili which will have to be resourced. We put in money last year. The Irish NGOs there wish to meet me to put their case. We cannot open the office and put in the facilities without resources and we will have to see what will be required. In principle we have made the decision to do that. The NGOs have also given me details of some other requests.</P>
      <P>I spoke last night to the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr. Antonio Guterres, who has made an enormous contribution in terms of manpower. The Portuguese are very appreciative of the interest and the sustained effort and involvement of this country, and he is urging people to assist. The distance is long and the costs are fairly excessive because of the circumstances, but they are absolutely necessary. We will have to see what resources will be needed but I will undertake that mission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the commitment of the Taoiseach and the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs. The people of East Timor were given a considerable indication by the Irish Government to pursue their dream of independence. Would the Taoiseach now not recognise that it is incumbent on him, as Taoiseach, to outline very clearly what the Irish Government intends to do rather than hearing the views of the NGOs? Is there a plan in Iveagh House as to what kind of assistance will be made available, the level at which that will be kept, the duration and the amount of money and resources that are required? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was already done in the preliminary stage, when the Australian forces went in last year. Now it is a different situation. UNTAET is now in place. We did it last year when both Jose Ramos-Horta and Xanana Gusmao visited me and requested it, but now things have moved on and there are new requests. They certainly want a base and Irish people there. They still want our military personnel there along with the Rangers. We will have to assess what they require. The plans which Deputy David Andrews <Col N="573" /> discussed on two occasions last year were implemented but that was not a commitment on an ongoing basis. There was a decision in principle to open a base in Dili. We have to honour that decision, resource it and staff it. Our NGOs have been around the region. I do not know precisely what the demands are at this stage but I will next week.</P>

      <Quest>the proportion of urban waste water discharged without treatment; the proportion which receives (i) preliminary treatment, (ii) primary treatment, (iii) secondary treatment and (iv) secondary treatment and nutrient reduction, and the target date by which all urban waste water will be treated.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 61 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, requires the Environmental Protection Agency to report on the quality of effluents being discharged from sanitary authority waste water facilities. The most recent report published by the agency, Urban Waste Water Discharges in Ireland &ndash; A Report for the Years 1996 and 1997, outlines details of the discharges, with a population equivalent greater than 1,000, and the level of treatment afforded to these discharges. Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library. The EPA expects to publish a report in relation to 1998 and 1999 later this year.</P>
      <P>The report established that there are 238 discharges with a population equivalent greater than 1,000 and collectively they represent a total population equivalent of more than 3.9 million.</P>
      <P>In terms of treatment the report concluded that 39% of waste water arisings did not receive any form of treatment; 7% of waste water arisings received preliminary treatment only; 28% of waste water arisings received primary treatment only; 22% of waste water arisings received secondary treatment only; and 4% of waste water arisings received phosphorus reduction in addition to secondary treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for urban waste water infrastructure under my Department's water services investment programme is focused on meeting the requirements of the urban waste water treatment regulations. In line with EU legislation, these require that all waste water discharges from systems with a population equivalent to over 2,000 be treated by 31 December 2005. Priority is being given to advancing and completing work in respect of discharges from major urban centres, where an earlier deadline of 31 December 2000 applies. Priority is also being given to the nine towns discharging to inland waters designated under the regulations as sensitive to pollution and <Col N="574" /> required to have more stringent than secondary treatment by the end of 1998. Nutrient reduction facilities are in place in seven of these and are being actively advanced in the remaining two.</P>
    <P>The national development plan provides for capital expenditure of £3 billion in the period 2000-06 under our investment programme, the major portion of which will be devoted to wastewater treatment facilities. This is three times the investment for these services over the 1994-99 period. I will shortly publish the first water and sewerage services investment programme under the new national development plan and this will set out in detail the areas and schemes that will benefit in the next three years.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer my original question, namely, what is the target date by which all urban waste water will be treated? Will he indicate whether such a date has been set? Will he identify the two major urban centres where treatment should have commenced by the end of 1998 and where such treatment has yet to be completed?</P>

      <P>With regard to his second question, I stated that priority has been given to nine towns discharging to inland waters designated under the regulations as sensitive to pollution. The towns concerned are Navan, Longford, Castlebar, Castlebar-Osberstown, Nenagh, Tullamore, Athlone, Killarney and Cavan. I do not know the names of the other two towns to which the Deputy referred but I will obtain that information for him.</P>

      <P>I would be grateful for that. The Minister stated twice that a target date has been set. He should do himself the favour of realising that we listen intently to what he says. I heard all his original reply and I thank him for his further clarification. The Minister indicated that by 31 December 2005 waste water arisings, as they are quaintly called, from urban centres with populations of over 2,000 should be treated. He stated earlier that he has data in respect of waste water arising from urban centres with populations of over 1,000. Will he inform the House if there is a date by which waste water from urban centres with populations of less than 2,000 should be completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have provided £3 billion for the period 2000-06 and, if possible, we hope to complete the process within that timeframe, even in respect of discharges from agglomerations with populations of 1,000. As stated earlier, our priority is to complete major works first. This will mean completing work in the nine towns to which <Col N="575" /> I referred, proceeding to deal with areas with populations in excess of 2,000 and, if possible, carrying out works in areas with populations of less than 2,000.</P>
      <P>There are 155 urban agglomerations with population equivalents in excess of 2,000, while 238 have population equivalents greater than 1,000. It is our aim to try to ensure that all these are treated by 2005. However, I can make no promises in that regard. It is our intention to ensure that treatment works in the 155 agglomerations with populations in excess of 2,000 will be completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>No statistics are available to my Department on the number of evictions from private rented accommodation. However, I am aware of claims by the housing advice agency that there has been a noticeable increase in evictions in recent years.</P>
      <P>The rights of tenants of private rented accommodation and the protections available to them are, in the first instance, governed by the terms of the lease or tenancy agreement under which the tenancy is held. These are subject to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the security of tenure issue, there is a need to achieve a balance between the rights of both the tenant and the landlord in a manner that meets constitutional requirements while ensuring continued investment in the provision and maintenance of rented accommodation. This is a particularly complex and difficult issue to address. On one hand, tenants seek a measure of security, which is both understandable and desirable while, on the other, landlords seek to recover and use their properties as they see fit. Therefore, what is needed is some form of regulation that provides greater security for tenants while avoiding over-regulation, which would result in owners withdrawing their properties from the rental market. To this end, last July I established the commission on the private rented residential sector. The commission is examining the working of the landlord and tenant relationship in respect of the private rented sector and will make recommendations, including, where <Col N="576" /> necessary, on legislative changes. The commission is due to report by 1 June, at which stage I will consider the measures required to implement its recommendations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of rent increases over the past three years, such information is not available to my Department. However, rent increases tend to reflect the rise in house prices. As the Deputy knows, house prices have increased significantly in recent years, although, I am glad to say, the rate of increase has now begun to slow down. I do not consider it acceptable that landlords should take advantage of the current situation and increase rents just because house prices have risen.</P>
    <P>Realistically, the housing demand level is creating pressure on both prices and rents and the only long-term solution to this problem is to balance supply and demand. The Government is acutely aware of the problem and in addition to the actions taken in recent years to help alleviate the situation, such as the integrated area plans, section 23 provisions and urban renewal schemes, the Government has committed itself under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to take specific actions to address the supply and affordability issue, including social housing. Effectively, the aim is to ensure that every household has access to affordable, secure, good quality housing appropriate to its needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not speak volumes for the Government's and the Minister of State's lack of interest in the plight of tenants in private rented accommodation that he is not in a position to inform the House of the number of tenants who were thrown out of their accommodation by their landlords or indicate the amount by which rents have increased in the private rented sector? Does the Minister of State accept that several hundred tenants were evicted from their accommodation in 1999 by their landlords? Does he also accept that rents in the private rented sector have doubled since he assumed office almost three years ago? Does the Minister further accept that there is a total imbalance in the relationship between landlords and tenants in that sector and that Ireland is unique in Europe in that tenants are afforded little or no legal protection? When does he intend to introduce legislation to give protection to tenants who are faced each week with increases in rent or are being evicted from their accommodation and who have no security of tenure in respect of that accommodation?</P>

      <P>The reality is that this action has been taken and the Deputies opposite are aware that the representation on the commission is well balanced between the interests of tenants and those of landlords. I have given it a remit to report to me by 1 June, which is quite a short time, considering the very complex issues which other Governments backed away from over the years. I have said this Government will examine very carefully the recommendations that emerge from that commission, with the intention of taking whatever action is reasonable and possible to improve the situation, particularly for tenants. However, the other side of the equation must also be taken into account, that is, that landlords also have rights.</P>
      <P>My interest in this is on the record. I have said on numerous occasions that we must get balance in the housing market. Until we do so, we will have this situation in regard to house prices, which will also be reflected in rent prices. It is not a satisfactory situation. I have taken strong action to try to deal with the issue. Until we get the output of housing units into balance with the level of demand, we can expect the market to take some advantage of the situation.</P>
      <P>Any other measures, such as rent controls, have been shot down by our courts and are not a practical solution to this problem. I am trying to work out a way of dealing with it which is fair to both sides.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Waste Database, NWD, report published by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1996 indicates that, in 1995, 7.8% of household and commercial waste was recycled, while 17.3% of reported hazardous and non-hazardous industrial waste was recovered. Information and statistics on recycling performance in 1999 are not yet available. I understand the Environmental Protection Agency will shortly publish a National Waste Database report for 1998.</P>
      <P>As outlined in my policy statement, Changing our Ways, overall Government policy on waste management is committed to a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which will deliver ambitious waste recycling and recovery targets. These are stated over a 15 year time frame to include a diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill, a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable municipal waste consigned to landfill, the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of organic waste annually, recycling of 35% of municipal waste, and recycling at least 50% of C&amp;D waste within a five year period, with a progressive increase to at least 85% over 15 years.</P>
      <P>The waste management plans currently being developed and adopted by the local authorities are generally aimed at meeting these targets and incorporate proposals for household segregation and &ldquo;kerbside&rdquo; collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas; an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas, typically with a target density of one facility per 500 population; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; and a range of waste treatment and disposal facilities.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the systematic approach now being adopted will provide a good basis on which to address the difficulties associated with improving our national materials recycling performance.</P>
      <P>In addition, a policy statement on waste recycling and waste recovery generally is currently in preparation. This policy document will address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area, and outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in support of better recycling performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a large gap between the 7.8% recycling rate he quoted and the target rates to which we are committed? He said there will be another policy document. We have already had policy documents. We have seen the recent demise of Kerbside in Dublin, which showed our commitment to recycling is a sham. The system collapsed as it did not have the markets. Recycling did not work. Is our recycling system simply a matter of collecting the products and dumping them in the landfill? That seems to be all we are doing. How will the <Col N="579" /> Minister intervene to ensure we have the markets for recyclable products?</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that recycling and waste management is a matter for local authorities. However, that is not working as local authorities simply cannot develop those markets. What has the Minister done since the recent demise of Kerbside, which showed that our recycling policy is not working? I contend the figure is less than 7.8%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure to which the Deputy and I referred is a 1995 figure. I regret we do not have a more up to date figure. I expect that figure will be substantially higher when the 1998 figures are published.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that there is a long way to go before we achieve the targets set out in the programme. The Waste Management Act, 1996, established the general framework. It has been useful to publish &ldquo;Changing our Ways&rdquo;, which has given more direction to local authorities. I accept the Deputy's argument. My predecessor brought in the waste management Act, but I sat opposite him and agreed with the general thrust of his policy at that time. However, it did not work. Similarly, in the case of recycling there is a need for more direction from the Department. However, the policy will have to be effected at a local level.</P>
      <P>There are inherent difficulties in achieving high recycling targets in Ireland because of the demographic factors, the limited support infrastructure and the lack of reprocessing capacity. However, when the waste management plans, which take an integrated approach, are put in place, people will be interested in providing infrastructure, either privately or through public private partnerships, and we will be in a much better position to achieve our targets. I mentioned areas where we can achieve the targets, particularly in the area of C&amp;D waste, over the next few years. They are fairly substantial. However, there is fair distance to go to achieve our desires and targets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since taking office, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I have made litter eradication a priority. Reflecting this, a range of anti-litter initiatives have been taken, including doubling the on-the-spot fine to £50; allocating almost £1 million to local authorities for anti-litter initiatives in the last three years, and a similar grant scheme will operate in 2000; co-financing the An Taisce led national spring clean; approving the development of a national monitoring system to assess local authority anti-litter action, which will be fully implemented over the coming months; establishing a national anti-litter forum to promote greater involvement on the part of the business sector in anti-litter action. The forum is developing a programme of measures to extend responses to litter pollution. In addition, there is continuing strong personal support from me and the Minister at many fora, conferences and launches of local litter campaigns.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for tackling litter pollution rests with local authorities. I am satisfied authorities are using the extended powers now available to them to take a more pro-active approach. Figures for the first half of 1999, the latest available, show that almost 300 litter wardens were employed, nearly 8,300 on-the-spot fines were issued, more than 850 prosecutions were taken and more than 350 convictions secured. These figures represent a significant improvement over earlier periods. Full details are in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, however, that the general improvement in local authority performance should be continued and extended to cover all authorities. I will continue to convey my views in this matter directly to elected members and managers. The House can be assured we will continue <Col N="581" /> to work actively with local authorities and the various sectors to realise our vision of a litter free Ireland.</P>

      <P>If litter eradication is a priority for the Minister of State, does he accept that, notwithstanding all the initiatives he mentioned in his reply, the policy has been a failure and that we are a disgrace in Europe due to the amount of litter scattered all over the countryside? Will he organise a national effort for a week to mobilise local authorities, State agencies and voluntary bodies to clean up the countryside?</P>
      <P>What steps is he taking to ensure local authorities carry out their functions? They are not sweeping the streets or providing enough litter bins. Where bins are provided they are not being emptied and local authorities are not enforcing the litter laws with any effect. Will the Minister of State take more urgent steps to deal with the problem of litter and show some leadership on this issue so that we as a people can be proud of our country and visitors will not continue to make the comments they have been making to tourism agencies?</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that An Taisce organised the national spring clean last year. This involved 1,700 organisations and more than 120,000 people. It was a great success and will be repeated this year. We are not sitting back on this issue and we are anxious to involve as many people as possible to highlight to need for participation at all levels of the community.</P>
      <P>Local authority members, particularly those who are also Members of this House, should be more proactive on the issue. I would like to know whether local authority members have discussed local litter management plans or put pressure on managers and officials to ensure the Act is implemented. This House passed the Act and it is up to local authorities to enforce it. Enforcement coincides with education. This is a two-way process and we all have a role to play. The Minister and I have spared no effort in every part of the country to highlight, participate in and ensure local involvement in dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the many organisations that are helping to improve the environment, particularly those in education, NGOs and others. There is much to be done and it is unsatisfactory that some local authorities are more proactive than others on this issue. Will Deputy Gilmore pursue his local authority to ensure the Act is implemented?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wallace is the Minister of State with responsibility for environmental protection. In so far as the protection of the environment from litter is concerned, his efforts have been a remarkable failure. It is the Minister of State's function to provide the leadership to ensure local authorities carry out their functions and, where they are not doing so, to take remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> To remove litter from our streets we do not need more pens, papers or plans from local authorities but more brushes, shovels, effort and elbow grease. Will the Minister of State provide local authorities with the resources, energy and leadership to achieve this objective rather than engaging in the paper exercises we have seen concerning the problem of litter?</P>
    <P>One of the problems local authorities face with the enforcement of litter laws is that a prosecution can take place only if the offender is caught by a litter warden or a garda. Will the Minister of State extend the category of authorised officers empowered to enforce litter laws to include residents associations, schools and various other bodies so that we achieve a greater mobilisation of responsible people to create the kind of culture necessary to stop people engaging in the anti-social practice of littering our countryside?</P>

      <P>The affordable housing scheme which involves the provision by local authorities of additional new houses specifically for low income purchasers on land provided by the local authorities was launched last year as an additional measure to enable local authorities to assist low income house purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of suitable sites including, where necessary, the acquisition of land, and the planning and construction of houses, of necessity, requires some time to arrange. Some 40 houses were completed under the scheme by the end of 1999 which was less than I had hoped for. At <Col N="583" /> present I understand a further 126 houses are under construction and more than 1,600 are at various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>The affordable housing scheme complements the shared ownership scheme and many local authorities are developing housing projects to provide low income house purchasers with an option to purchase under either scheme. Transactions under the shared ownership scheme increased significantly last year with some 1,400 houses purchased under the scheme compared with 805 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Bill will facilitate local authorities to acquire land to provide houses under the affordable and shared ownership schemes. I am confident that output under these schemes will reach the combined targets of 2,000 units per year set in the national development plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Water quality problems in group water schemes, particularly those using private sources and serving some 50,000 households, are <Col N="586" /> at the centre of the EU's concerns. I have initiated extensive measures to help bring these groups, which generally lack any form of water treatment or disinfection, into compliance with drinking water standards.</P>
      <P>Last year some £39 million was spent on rural water compared to £8.5 million in 1996. A total of £420 million is being provided in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the rural water programme and much of this will focus on resolving the difficulties in the group sector. Based on recommendations of the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee which represents group schemes, rural organisations, local authorities and my own Department, comprehensive rural water strategies are now being developed at county level. These will identify how the quality issue can be tackled through upgrading and renewal works on group schemes and by optimising usage of public and private water infrastructure.</P>
      <P>New water treatment technologies are also being piloted in group schemes at some 30 locations. The moneys to fund the county strategies and to pay for the installation of new group scheme treatment and filtration technology where required have been provided in the NDP. I am also reviewing the grant and subsidy regime for group schemes to ensure they will be in a position to meet the additional investment and running costs falling to them.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that, against the background of the enormous and genuine efforts already being made, the Commission should now be contemplating court action against Ireland. The Commission itself acknowledges the progress now being made after what it calls &ldquo;years of neglect&rdquo;. Earlier this month, I wrote to Commissioner Wallstrom, requesting a meeting to give her details of the extensive action we are already taking to resolve these problems.</P>

We are currently trying various methods of disinfecting the water and some of those experiments have been very positive. We had to go through this procedure to ensure the most effective ways of tackling the present problem are used.</P>

That is the only indication we gave. It is not possible to set out a time frame for a solution to the problem. We must ensure private group water schemes co-operate as well. There is not any legislation in place to compel such schemes to adopt the standards. We have introduced regulations and will pursue them in consultation with the group water schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 38 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The arrangements announced by the Government to ensure a large increase in Dublin taxi numbers provide that one additional taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi licence will be offered to each individual who held a taxi licence in the Dublin taximeter area at the end of 1999, as well as 500 further licences to be granted to applicants under the current points assessment system. Regulations made on 13 January 2000 established an implementation process for these measures and applications were subsequently invited by Dublin Corporation from every person who held, or was entitled to hold, a taxi licence in Dublin as at 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide for the making of an offer to grant a wheelchair accessible taxi licence to each licence holder who expresses a preference for the grant of such a licence and who complies with the requirements of the regulations. All remaining licences, including those to be offered to applicants on the current points assessment system, are to be allocated in accordance with a scheme to be finalised. I am advised by the corporation that over 2,600 applications for an additional taxi licence from existing licence holders have now been received. Applications have not yet been sought for licences to be allocated on the current points assessment system.</P>
      <P>I have held a series of meetings with the taxi representative groups about the new arrangements, as well as responding in writing to a number of stated concerns presented to me. Within the process, some taxi representatives have proposed the establishment of a board to oversee taxi affairs generally and have also indicated their concerns about the need to improve taxi fare structures and certain other aspects of taxi regulation in the Dublin taximeter area. I have agreed to take up these issues with the competent Dublin local authorities without prejudice to progressing the increase in taxi licences as determined by the Government.</P>
      <P>On 7 February the High Court granted leave to a number of individuals to seek a judicial review in relation to a number of provisions contained in the Public Service Vehicles Regulations. The court has also granted an interim injunction preventing Dublin Corporation and Dundalk Urban District Council from granting certain taxi licences. The resolution of these matters will be pursued urgently in the courts and intervention on my part would not be appropriate at this point. I understand the matter will go before the High Court on 21 March 2000.</P>

      <P>I do not believe I said I would not take any further action. I said I would not be able to proceed with the issue of licences. However, I am looking at other areas of the taxi service in Dublin with a view to implementing some of the suggestions made to me by the taxi interest groups and which I believe would help to improve the taxi service to the commuting public. That would be in the interests of all, including the users and operators of the service. It would be much more remunerative for the operators if the service was more efficiently operated and if aspects, such as global positioning systems, were available and in place. I am favourably disposed to looking at that and I have offered to fund a viability study. Since then, Dublin Corporation has undertaken to carry out a study.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to say that the entire process has stopped, but I cannot comment on the court case. That will proceed and we must accept the decision.</P>

These people will be unable to receive any of the additional licence plates. It is another example of the monopoly power within the taxi industry.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State also give further consideration to a scheme proposed by those involved in the local employment service, where a certain number of taxi plates would be designated to people emerging from long-term unemployment who want to get into the taxi industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>My Department participates in a number of cross-departmental initiatives aimed at tackling social exclusion on a broad basis and which come under the aegis of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. This involves close working with other relevant Departments, including the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government Act, 1994, local authorities are empowered to provide, operate and maintain parks and open spaces for amenity and recreational purposes. The criteria to be applied to the provision of public open space in housing schemes is a matter for each local authority in accordance with its development plan. When deciding planning applications, a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently published planning guidelines on residential density indicate that public open space is one of the key elements in defining the quality of the residential environment. The guidelines acknowledge that, in general, planning authorities set out detailed quantitative standards for public open space in their development plans, but that they place less emphasis on qualitative standards. This can give rise to residential estates having adequate amounts of open space, but it may be poorly located or unsuitably shaped, resulting in <Col N="592" /> underused spaces or, in some cases, areas which encourage anti-social activity.</P>
    <P>The guidelines indicate that the achievement of higher densities must be coupled with a higher standard of residential environment and thus the provision of higher quality communal and public open spaces is of paramount importance. The guidelines recommend that any acceptance of lower quantitative standards of open space must be accompanied by a parallel increase in the qualitative standards. They also set out detailed qualitative and quantitative standards in relation to the provision of public open space in higher density residential developments.</P>
    <P>The provision of open spaces, recreational facilities and amenity areas specifically in local authority housing schemes is also a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. Appropriate facilities of this kind are, on a limited basis, funded as part of the cost of a housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations. Local authorities have been advised, in guidelines issued by the Department, that new housing should comprise small, well-designed schemes, be integrated as far as possible with housing and other developments in the area, create a good living environment for the residents and be convenient to various services and amenities.</P>
    <P>Funding is available under my Department's remedial works scheme to assist housing authorities to carry out major essential works of a structural nature to dwellings in designated run-down housing estates. The objective is not only to upgrade the fabric of the dwellings but to improve the living conditions of the tenants. For this reason works of an environmental nature, including certain amenity and recreational facilities, may be included as part of a project where they are considered necessary to support the work undertaken to the dwellings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My God, that is a long answer to a very simple question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the greatest load of gobbledegook I have heard in a long time. Is <Col N="593" /> the Minister aware that local authorities are not given moneys for the provision of playing pitches, parks, open spaces or amenities, which is what I asked about in the question? The word &ldquo;environment&rdquo;  in the Department's title is a total misnomer. The Minister's Department is responsible for housing, water, sewerage and nothing else apart from perhaps minor roads. Local authorities do not get any money for providing the facilities I mentioned in my question. Why will the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, not do something meaningful about this? It was being done 100 years ago, but in the meantime we have gone backwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where new local authority housing schemes are under way it is possible to use some of the capital funding to provide amenities for the new residents. Local authorities also have other funding available to them, and other Departments, such as the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, have moneys available for sporting facilities which can be helpful in providing playing pitches, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is as I have outlined. The Deputy makes little of the fact that local authorities have access to much greater sums of money. They have their own resources on the one hand and access to the local government fund on the other. They make their own choices in regard to the provision of additional facilities. The question seems to relate to local authority housing and in that case we are prepared to make extra money available for the provision of some facilities for new estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that local authorities use their housing allocations only to build houses and that there is not any provision made by the Department to allow local authorities provide the amenities about which I am talking? Because of the need for more and more housing these amenities will never be provided. Therefore, the Minister's answer is ludicrous &ndash; it is not an answer but an evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should acquaint himself with what is happening and what is being approved under new local authority housing schemes and remedial works schemes. Grants are being made available for communal facilities. I will be happy to supply the Deputy with some information in this regard if it would be of assistance to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcomes this opportunity to update the House as to the current situation in Mozambique. Having made such dramatic progress in their efforts to overcome the civil war that ravaged their country for 17 years, the people of Mozambique are now being subjected to one of the worst natural disasters to hit the region in half a century.</P>
      <P>On 4 February, torrential rains began failing on the southern provinces of Mozambique. In just three days, from 4 to 6 February, more rain fell on Maputo than would normally fall in an entire six month rainy season. The heavy rains pushed rivers to their highest levels on record and caused many to burst their banks, flooding the surrounding areas, washing away homes and cutting off access by road to many regions. While the process of gathering information was initially impeded by the lack of access, it was clear that thousands of people had been affected and left homeless. Main road and railway lines were severed, with widespread damage to other infrastructure. On 10 February the Government of Mozambique declared a state of emergency and requested international assistance. Initially the areas worst affected by the heavy rains and resultant flooding were Maputo and Matola cities. However, with the rising water levels in the Limpopo and Save rivers, flooding began to affect much of Maputo, Gaza and lnhambane provinces in the south as well as central portions of Mozambique, leading to a drastic increase in the needs for emergency rescue and relief assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relief operation quickly got under way. The World Food Programme, in partnership with the Government of Mozambique, initiated a programme of urgent food delivery to people who had lost their homes and crops or been displaced <Col N="595" /> by the flooding. They launched a dedicated air bridge to airlift food and non-food items to those stranded in the flood affected areas of Maputo, Gaza and lnhambane provinces. The Government of Mozambique began setting up collective centres in schools and factories to house the homeless in the cities of Maputo and Matola.</P>
    <P>The international community also responded generously with donations coming in from Ireland, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Spain to name but a few. South Africa, as the regional military and economic power, provided logistical support including military helicopters to help in the rescue effort.</P>
    <P>However, just as the relief operation was beginning to make progress, cyclone Eline hit the coast of Mozambique on 21 February aggravating an already critical flood situation. The helicopters that had been being used to airlift food and emergency supplies to populations sheltering in collective centres were now being called into service to rescue the people themselves from the rapid advance of water. We have all seen the horrendous pictures on television of helicopters winching people to safety from roofs and tree tops. It is currently estimated that approximately 300,000 people have been directly affected by the floods with as many as 80,000 people needing to be evacuated. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimate that 70 people are dead or missing. These numbers could rise well beyond this figure. As certain isolated areas remain inaccessible to ground assessment teams these figures are not reliable. The rescue operation is continuing with more aircraft arriving today. The Government has been to the forefront in providing humanitarian aid to the victims of this disaster. We co-ordinated our response with the aid flowing in from other countries and concentrated on meeting the priority needs of the thousands of homeless. Since the flooding began four weeks ago, Ireland has provided £400,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance. This is in addition to the ongoing development assistance we provide to Mozambique as part of our development aid programme.</P>
    <P>An initial emergency allocation of £160,000 was made on 21 February in response to the devastation caused by the first lot of flooding. The money was provided to the World Food Programme towards the cost of its air-bridge operation in lnhambane Province. Money was also provided to Concern, one of the Irish agencies operational on the ground in Mozambique, for an emergency relief project in Maputo. These allocations were made following advice from our embassy in Maputo which continues to monitor the crisis. The embassy took the initiative in organising an aerial survey of the province of Inhambane, which had not been assessed prior to this, to investigate reports of flooding throughout the province. Embassy staff were accompanied by the Provincial Governor of lnhambane on this survey.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Following the devastation caused as result of the cyclone, I announced a further package of assistance yesterday amounting to £240,000. Part of this second allocation will go to WFP to assist it further in what has become a rescue operation. We are also funding fuel to allow the South African Air Force to deliver emergency goods by helicopter to the affected areas. Ireland Aid is engaged in a long-term development partnership with Mozambique. The partnership commenced in 1996. Expenditure under this programme was £6.4 million in 1999 and the budget for this year is £7.4 million.</P>
    <P>The programme involves support for national programmes, including support for debt relief, and regional development programmes in two provinces. One of the regional development programmes is in lnhambane &ndash; one of the provinces most affected by the current emergency. Programme activities to date have helped to develop both infrastructural and institutional capacity. This will have enhanced the capacity of the Mozambican authorities to deal with the current emergency. In addition, Ireland Aid staff in both lnhambane and the national capital, Maputo, are currently working actively with the Mozambican authorities and other donors in planning the response to the current emergency. This morning, our Head of Mission in Maputo, Justin Carroll, travelled to lnhambane, as part of an emergency needs assessment mission. Its advice has ensured that the emergency funding of £400,000 provided to date by the Government, has been allocated to where it can be most effective. This funding is in addition to the programme expenditure of more than £7 million.</P>
    <P>From this point, programme expenditure will be administered with maximum flexibility to help Mozambique to deal with the emergency. As soon as the situation has stabilised, priority will be given to reconstruction and recovery activities as well as to the ongoing programme of supporting Mozambique's long-term development. It is important to maintain a long-term focus to ensure we address the fundamental problem and not just its immediate symptoms, which are horrific.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply. She will no doubt be aware that Mozambique's debt repayments amount to £60 million per annum, according to information I received from Trócaire, whereas its domestic budget provides $20 million for primary health care and $32 million for primary education. While the amount provided by the Government is substantial, it does not go anywhere close to meeting Mozambique's primary needs. Against that background, and notwithstanding the immediacy of the difficulties facing the debt relief operation, will the Minister of State give an assurance to the House that she, along with the Government, will argue for the unilateral cancellation of outstanding debt for the Mozambique republic in a manner similar to that <Col N="597" /> adopted by the international community when Honduras was devastated by natural disaster?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that Mozambique is burdened with a crippling debt and spends more on debt repayments than on education and primary health care. In the past few years Mozambique has had a positive economic performance and an effective debt relief programme. Ireland has bilaterally contributed $5 million to the programme. Following its success, Mozambique and interested donors are preparing the ground for a more general programme of budget support. This is a logical step given the country's positive economic performance.</P>
      <P>Following the destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, it was accepted by the international community that no matter how well the country performed economically the scale of the disaster was such that it made the debt unsustainable and, therefore, it could not be repaid. In so far as we are aware of the significance and impact of the disaster in Mozambique, I agree with the Deputy that even if Mozambique's debt is reduced to sustainable levels, it will not be able to repay it. I call for a cancellation of Mozambique's debt. I also support the Jubilee 2000 programme which calls for the cancellation of the debt of the world's least developed countries, such as Mozambique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree it is easy for us to call on others to do something and that she should bring forward the legislation I have sought which would ensure Ireland would meet its 0.7% of GNP contribution to world aid? If we do so, we can with some authority ask others to take the steps proposed by her.</P>
      <P>Does she further agree, given that the Mozambican Government declared a state of emergency on 10 February, that our response 11 days later was quite late? Why has there not been a meeting of EU development Ministers? The Mozambican people need helicopters. There are only five helicopters available to ferry up to 500,000 people. They are clinging to roof tops and hanging off trees and pylons and there have been 70 reported deaths so far. Will the figure reach 70,000 or 100,000 next week? What will the House be told next week? Has the Minister of State taken steps to ask for a meeting of development Ministers tomorrow in Brussels to put pressure on our EU colleagues, EU applicant states and the United States to make available the necessary helicopters to get those people to safety? That is what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there was any delay on the part of our people in Mozambique to respond immediately to the crisis. We were to the fore following the first weekend of storms. The Irish embassy funded an immediate aerial survey by helicopter of the devastated Inhambane Province and it has been to the fore working in concert with international aid agencies <Col N="598" /> to provide relief. There has been no complaints about the swift response of humanitarian agencies in Mozambique. The scale of the flooding, aggravated by the cyclone which hit just as the relief efforts were beginning to make headway, was not foreseen.</P>
      <P>The UN has launched another appeal for millions of pounds more in aid and Ireland will respond. The development Ministers will meet but it is not a time for meetings. It is a time for people to work with each other through agreed formulae, as is the case in Inhambane Province.</P>

      <P>Our NGOs, such as GOAL, Trócaire and Concern, are already on the ground in Mozambique and they will put forward proposals to us in the coming days. We are co-operating with the WFP, UNICEF and the South African authorities in fuelling their helicopters. More helicopters arrived today and a concerted effort is being made in regard to this disaster.</P>
      <P>My budget of £7.5 million for Mozambique has already been re-directed. Plans are being made and we are in negotiations with the Provincial Governor of Inhambane to redirect funds which we had allocated for long-term development programmes to emergency and post-emergency assistance. We are fortunate in that we can be flexible with that budget to respond in line with the wishes of the Mozambican authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's comments and that we are dealing with an emergency. What plans, if any, does the Minister, her Department and Ireland Aid have to augment the number of NGO personnel on the ground to deal with the immediate crisis? Are proposals being contemplated by the Government to facilitate Defence Forces personnel to go to Mozambique to help in what is a major natural catastrophe in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the increased use of Irish NGOs, we are awaiting proposals from Irish NGOs on the ground in terms of the support they need. We have the funding ready to provide whatever assistance they need. As I understand it, the South African airforce, being the major economic and military force in the region, has taken on the responsibility in terms of the air transport and donor countries, such as Ireland and Great Britain, are funding the fuel for the use of those helicopters. The actual profile is changing by the hour, however, and just before I left the office we had a call from our embassy in Maputo saying that Justin Carroll was on his way to Inhambane to assess the situation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are long-term partners with the Mozambican authorities, we are liaising closely with the Government of Mozambique. It is a very large country and many of the people are living in isolated areas. It has a fairly small population, given <Col N="599" /> the size of the country, and many people are being moved to areas which are not under water. We anticipate that a major refugee problem will arise, possibly going into South Africa. All these issues are being considered by the international donor community, including Ireland, and I hope to be in a position to come back to the House with further updates should that be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from NGOs operating on the ground in Mozambique that the immediate need is for helicopters. According to information I received within the last hour, there is one helicopter for each 100,000 persons in need of rescue. If a meeting were to take place tomorrow or within 48 hours of the European Union's development Ministers, it would cause a sense of emergency and urgency, and put pressure on EU member and applicant states and the United States to provide the necessary helicopters to get those people to safety. We have seen the television pictures of women, children and men being winched to safety, in many cases dropping their only possessions from their hands into the flood waters as they are brought out, while thousands of others are stranded. They need helicopters now. Will the Minister of State please ask for an emergency meeting of development Ministers to cause that sense of emergency and urgency in respect of those people?</P>

      <P>I have no problem requesting or indeed attending a meeting of development Ministers to discuss this issue but as I understand it, more helicopters have been provided by the South African airforce. What is needed is fuel to keep the operation going and outside donors, such as Ireland and Great Britain, are providing fuel to provide more helicopters and keep them flying around the clock, as they have been for the past three weeks or so. I am sure there will be a meeting of development Ministers to discuss the situation in Mozambique and in other areas of devastation. It is not only Mozambique that has been hit.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Mitchell said, there are many precedents for development Ministers meeting in emergency session. It is extraordinary that this has not happened since 4 February. Has the Minister of State any reports on when the railway lines will be available to transport necessary food, etc. to the people? Does she have any report on the damage done to the Beira corridor railway line on which millions of dollars was spent over a number of years to bring it up to a useable condition? In a meeting which I hope she will urge her colleagues to hold, will she strongly suggest that every effort should be made to keep the Mozambicans in their own country rather than <Col N="601" /> allow them become refugees and join the massive refugee movement in southern Africa? The conditions for refugees are never the same as they would be if the people remained in their own country. The 80,000 or so people the Minister of State said need to be evacuated should be given assistance in their own homeland rather than moved to some of the neighbouring countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently all of the effort is to take people from the roofs of houses and other buildings to areas which are not overwhelmed with flood waters. It is difficult to assess when the flood waters are likely to recede. The rainy season in Mozambique usually lasts until March and in addition, the flooding in South Africa and Botswana will more than likely result in further flooding in Mozambique because the excess water drains through Mozambique towards the sea. There is no doubt that in the medium to long-term, there will be enormous problems of rehabilitation and housing.</P>
      <P>I have no distinct information as to the state of the railway line but the reports I received just before coming to the House indicate that the situation is dire and that much of Inhambane, and some of the other provinces, are completely submerged in water. Boats are being dropped to allow people to at least move off the tops of houses. Potential outbreaks of cholera, meningitis and malaria remain an ongoing concern, and the sanitary conditions are very bad among the displaced population.</P>
      <P>Another problem being experienced, as the Deputy will be aware having visited Mozambique, is that mines have been dislodged. Mozambique is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world following civil war, and many of the mines have been dislodged because of the flood waters. That will cause further difficulties when the waters recede.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the best possible place for Mozambicans is within their own country and thankfully, because most of the land in Mozambique is owned by the state, people can be moved by the authorities away from flooded areas and allowed to settle in other areas without any undue difficulty. For that reason, and because it is such a huge country with a relatively small population of 18 million people, I would imagine that most people will be able to stay in Mozambique but they will be seriously displaced and in need of rehabilitation and assistance for many years to come.</P>

      <P>We extend our sympathy to the family of Patrick Shanahan who was elected to the Dáil in a by-election in 1945. The election was caused by the sudden death of Paddy Burke, a Fine Gael Deputy. In the succeeding ballot Patrick Shanahan won 72% of the vote of 21,500, a sweeping victory which gave Fianna Fáil four of the five seats in the constituency of Clare. The 1948 election, which Fianna Fáil lost after 16 years in Govenment, saw Patrick Shanahan lose his seat. He continued in the county council until 1955. He is survived by two sons and two daughters.</P>
      <P>While I never met Patrick Shanahan, a few years ago I had the privilege of meeting his brother who died shortly afterwards. He told me about the activities in which Patrick Shanahan had been involved throughout his life. His brother was particularly proud of the fact that Patrick, who lived near the sea, had been involved in many rescue operations and had saved a number of people from the sea over the years. They included the crew of a German warplane which had come down into the sea during the war.</P>
      <P>Patrick Shanahan was 92 years of age. I extend the sympathy of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government to his sons and daughters.</P>

Indeed, even the longest serving Member of the House for many years, the late Deputy Neil Blaney, did not serve with Patrick Shanahan because he was elected to the Dáil in the election in which Patrick Shanahan lost his seat.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has paid tribute to the memory of Patrick Shanahan, a long standing Fianna Fáil member of Clare County Council. Patrick Shanahan was involved in a number of important rescues. Interestingly, my information is that the rescue in which he took part in 1941, for which he won the Royal Humane Society award, was actually the rescue of the crew of a British plane. However, maybe he was involved in a second rescue.</P>

    <P>It is worth recalling that Patrick Shanahan, who died at the age of 92 years, links us to the War of Independence. His brother was executed for his part in that war after being captured by the Black and Tans. It is appropriate at this time, when the sacrifices that families made in different and <Col N="604" /> many ways to secure our independence are easily forgotten, to recall a man who served his country as Patrick Shanahan did.</P>

I cannot help but wonder, as might the Leas-Cheann Comhairle given his medical background, whether there is a lesson for the rest of us in the fact that somebody who served only three years in this House managed to survive for another 52 years. Members who have served in the Dáil for longer than we care to remember might wonder if a lesson can be learned with regard to the longevity of Mr. Shanahan's life after his short time in Dáil Éireann. He clearly had an interesting life and political career and we extend our sympathy to his family.</P>

He was a Member of the House for just three years but he was very much involved with Fianna Fáil in Clare and served on Clare County Council for ten years. Although the tragic murder of his brother by the Black and Tans left an indelible mark on Patrick Shanahan, he held no bitterness and was always anxious to end the hatred and bitterness that were generated by both the War of Independence and the Civil War. He worked for many years to restore good relations between the people, especially those who were involved in the Civil War politics of that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had a long and distinguished career in farming, to which he turned his attention after his term in Dáil Éireann, and established a successful dairy enterprise in west Clare. Most of his old friends and comrades predeceased him but he will be remembered in Clare for the work he did on <Col N="605" /> the county council and during his short-term as a Dáil Deputy.</P>

      <P>Having spoken about a former Deputy whom we did not know well, we speak now about the former Deputy Tom McEllistrim, whom most Members on this side of the House will remember well. He served in the House for many years and gave loyal and faithful service to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Tom came from a strong republican tradition which saw his father serve valiantly in the War of Independence and subsequently in Dáil Éireann from 1923 to 1969. Tom then served the people of north Kerry for more than 20 years with the same determination, dedication and loyalty. Tom's son continues that political tradition at local level.</P>
      <P>Tommy Mac had a great love of his church, community, sport, county, politics and his family. His loss is a loss for all his loves. He was never slow about expressing his views and was prepared to speak out strongly in this House, at local level and in the parliamentary party, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall. He led the way in many debates, particularly when arguing for the south west and his native north Kerry.</P>
      <P>Tom was born on 15 January 1932 and he became a member of the county council in 1967, where he served with distinction until 1992. He lost his seat for one term following a close election which will be remembered well by Deputy Spring. That was the subject of many stories and Tommy enjoyed telling those stories as much as anybody else. I have heard so many different versions, I am not sure which one is true. He continued to have a very strong interest and relationship with Fianna Fáil. A farewell, political party gathering was due to take place last Friday week but it was cancelled a few weeks ago as his health was deteriorating. He was proud to become a Minister of State at the Department of Finance in 1979-81, where he had responsibility for the Office of Public Works, and at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in 1982. When I was a young Deputy the Office of Public Works was introducing mobile exchanges, which was a major issue, and I found him to be a very helpful Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Rural funerals can be large but the size of Tom's funeral speaks for itself. The crowd filed past his coffin to his family from 4.30 p.m. until 9.30 p.m., something that would not happen in this city. This was an enormous tribute and respect to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about my stories of Tom McEllistrim by Radio Kerry and I gave a few good ones. I remember in 1978 as a young Member of 25 years of age, and not having much experience of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party rooms, hearing Tom announce that the civil war in Kerry had ended. This struck me as peculiar but, as I got to <Col N="606" /> know him over the years, I began to understand the way he saw things. He was a good man and people will tend to remember him for his support for Charles Haughey. He was a tremendous and hard worker for his constituents. He served very well on local issues. Through the years, even since his departure from politics, his interventions were in regard to schools, roads and local authority issues and people will always have memories of him in that regard. His family would like him remembered for the way he served the people of north Kerry and the work he did. Appreciation was shown by all sides of the political divide by the attendance at his funeral last week.</P>
    <P>He carried the flag of Fianna Fáil straight and blunt. He was not a person who went under the counter about standing up for people and was respected by everyone. The Fianna Fáil Party extends its sympathies to his wife Marie, son Thomas and daughter Ann and is thankful for Tom's loyal service and to his family for allowing him give so much to the Fianna Fáil Party through the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I join in expressing sympathy to Tom McEllistrim's wife, Marie and his son and daughter on their great loss. It is testament to Tom McEllistrim's pride in his membership of this House and of the Seanad that recently when the President gave a reception for all former Members, despite very visible bad health, he travelled all the way from Ballymacelligott to Dublin to meet his colleagues and share in the celebration of the service that he and others gave in this House over a long time. As has been recalled, he was the son of the legendary Tom McEllistrim, T.D., one of the founder members of this House and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Frequently reference is made to the existence of dynasties in politics in a pejorative sense, but it is fair to say the McEllistrims served beliefs &ndash; not necessarily shared by everyone &ndash; which were held with deep sincerity by both Tom McEllistrim senior and junior. He was educated in St. Brendan's College, Killarney, a college which has produced so many of those who preside over us and of which he was proud. He was a member of Kerry County Council from 1967 onwards and, as the Taoiseach said, he will be greatly missed by his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party and by the people of Kerry on both sides of the divide. There will be great rejoicing in Kerry at the news that the civil war has ended.</P>

When he served in the Office of Public Works as a Minister of State he had among other things, responsibility for the Concert Hall project, which encountered a number of difficulties. He took a great interest in the project <Col N="607" /> and ensured it was completed. As Deputy Bruton said, he was a member of a political dynasty which, perhaps, we may not see again. He was very committed to represent politics and, while we may not have agreed with him on occasions, we shared his passion for politics.</P>

On behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party I extend sincere sympathy to the McEllistrim family on the loss of Tom who was, of course, our old friend and colleague. I had the privilege of serving, not only with Tom in 1969 when he succeeded his father who had been elected in 1923, but also with his father. Reference was made to Tom's allegiance to the former leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Haughey. I remind the Taoiseach and the House of an earlier leadership battle in Fianna Fáil when it was decided by some senior members that, in order to avoid the battle, Jack Lynch should be asked to put his name forward. One of the senior members of the party who approached Jack Lynch on that occasion was, of course, Tom McEllistrim senior who was a member of this House for a long time, almost since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt Tom had a passionate interest in Kerry, politics and the Fianna Fáil Party and served them to the best of his ability. It was a pleasure to have known him and it is a matter of great sadness and regret to see he has parted from us at a relatively young age. He was young to be called to his eternal reward and he will be missed by many people. In his inimitable way he addressed this House on many occasions and on many issues long before the introduction of television cameras. He fought the battle for his constituents in a very colourful way and was very successful. He was honoured when he was appointed Minister of State on two occasions.

I have four good reasons for remembering him from 1987 and, to my dying day, I will be glad the bus driver decided to go to south Kerry before north Kerry because, to the best of my knowledge, there were at least five solid Fianna Fáil students on that bus, if one can ever trust students. Tom was very proud of his achievements, both in Kerry County Council and in Dáil Éireann, especially when he <Col N="608" /> was honoured by being made a Minister of State. With Tom McEllistrim, what you saw was what you got. I would not always have agreed with his views, either his historical perspective or otherwise, but one could always deal with him on a straight basis.</P>
      <P>Prior to his being on Radio Kerry yesterday, the Taoiseach probably did not hear an interview with Tom McEllistrim conducted by an historian. He gave his loyalty to the former leader of Fianna Fáil, the former Deputy Haughey, and he was asked if, before he proposed Mr. Haughey for the leadership, his sacking from Cabinet before the arms trial had bothered him. Tom McEllistrim said: &ldquo;That stuff never bothered me&rdquo;. When he praised Mr. Haughey as a great Minister for Agriculture, the interviewer put it to him that the IFA would not agree with him. He said: &ldquo;Don't bother about them; they're all Fine Gael&rdquo;. Tom had his opinions and he told them. He always did so as a county councillor and in the House.</P>
      <P>His family have great memories of a loyal public servant and a man who was very proud of and steeped in the Fianna Fáil tradition. The Taoiseach is convinced the Civil War is over but perhaps he had better speak to Fianna Fáil in north Kerry before he is convinced.</P>

      <P>As a constituency colleague of Tom McEllistrim, I join previous speakers in their expressions of sympathy to the McEllistrim family. The family has made a major and unselfish contribution to politics since the foundation of the State and has given an unselfish commitment to the people of north Kerry which continues to the present day with Councillor Tom McEllistrim taking on the family mantle. Like Deputy Spring, I dispute the Taoiseach's conviction that the Civil War has ended in Kerry. I remember some great occasions when I first came into politics when I had some very good personal encounters with Tom in front of church gates throughout north Kerry. I always give way to seniority but I never gave way to his analysis of where we came from.</P>
      <P>That said, I enjoyed a very good working relationship with Tom McEllistrim, both in this House and on Kerry County Council. I always found him up front. What you saw was what you got. There was nothing underhand about the man; he was always very straightforward. It is a trait which seems to be absent from politics today, but he was certainly a straight individual, and I always admired him for that. Kerry politics and Irish politics will be at a loss without him.</P>

      <P>My question relates to promised legislation which, if enacted, might reduce the number of deaths on building sites. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced a massive campaign earlier this week to reduce the number of fatal and serious accidents on sites. In that campaign, he indicated it was the Government's intention to increase the fines for breaches. This would require legislation. Given that the Labour Party has a Private Members' Bill in this area, No. 94 on the Order Paper, would the Government consider taking that Bill through Second Stage and making the necessary amendments? It provides for increases in fines. To facilitate the work of the House and the overloaded legislative programme, would the Government consider taking an existing Bill through Second Stage at least?</P>

However, the development of a transaction process that would meet the Government's objectives has proved to be complex and difficult.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McGuinness.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill provides for pensioners and will help to secure their future. This is a key priority of the Government. Since June 1997 significant steps have been taken to build an inclusive society and the Bill continues along those lines. Pensions have been increased by £7 a week, which will bring old age contributory and retirement pensions to £96 per week. Contributory pensions for widowers aged 66 years or over have been increased to £89.10 and the old age non-contributory pension has been increased to £85.50. Both are on line to reach the £100 guideline by the year 2002. These increases represent progress for pensioners well ahead of the expected rise in average earnings.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a number of measures aimed at improving the incentive to work and to alleviate certain employment traps. Section 7 increases the weekly income threshold for family income supplement by £13 from May. This will lead to an increase of approximately £8 per week in the average FIS payment. By way of regulation the Minister also intends to increase from £5 to £10 per week the minimum payment provided under these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced in the budget, the qualifying adult allowance arrangements which relate to the treatment of spouses' earnings is being improved and extended to include people on invalidity, old age contributory and retirement pensions. At <Col N="618" /> present, the qualifying adult allowance is payable where the qualifying adult has income earnings of less than £60 per week. A reduction allowance is paid where his or her income is between £60 and £105 per week and, in such cases, child dependant increases are payable at the rate of 50%.</P>
    <P>The improvements announced in the budget provide for an upward adjustment of the income range of £70 to £135 per week and the full payment of child dependant payments until the spouses' earnings exceed £135 per week. Section 20 implements the latter measure. This improvement will be beneficial to families where the head of the household is claiming social welfare and the other spouse or partner is engaged in part-time work. A family with two children and earnings of £90 per week will be better off by £38 per week from May.</P>
    <P>Section 26 includes steps to improve the treatment of people in receipt of rent supplement who take up part-time or casual work opportunities. Under the existing arrangements, the increase in earnings is clawed back in full by way of reduced rent supplement payments. From April a £25 income disregard will be introduced to ensure a positive return to work for those who avail of part-time work opportunities. This section also provides for the disregard of additional income as a result of participating in training courses, such as FÁS, and skills training courses. This measure will take effect from April when 2,500 people are expected to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The role of carers in our society is invaluable. No Government has been more committed to and supportive of carers than this one. Action has also been taken on a wide range of measures both in terms of income support and services provided. The number of carers in receipt of carer's allowance has increased by more than 60%, from 9,200 when the Government took office in 1997 to more than 14,200 at the end of this month. Expenditure has also increased substantially from £35.5 million in 1997 to £78.3 million this year. The budget provides for a radical and innovative benefit scheme to enable carers to give up work temporarily to care for a person on a full-time basis while retaining their employment rights.</P>
    <P>The farm assist programme has been a source of income for farmers caught in the poverty trap. However, some social welfare officers who interview these farmers often treat them like criminals when they apply for the farm assist programme rather than being as co-operative as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill. Since the Minister's appointment, many radical changes have been made in the Department. It no longer resembles the Department of five or ten years ago. The service it provides for Deputies, public representatives and their constituents has been extremely efficient and proactive. I thank the officials in the Department for their speedy replies to the queries raised. It is a change to get such accurate and quick responses from that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> While I welcome the pension provisions in the Bill, the Fianna Fáil-led Government should revise its pension targets in line with the positive economic forecasts and aim for an increase of 50% over the lifetime of the Government. If one considers the actual rather than the percentage increase, one will note there is a need to increase pensions at a greater rate until we reach a realistic level of payment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of anomalies in the social welfare schemes, particularly in relation to differential rents. No sooner have pensioners received their budget increases when local authorities request details from pensioners and tenants of local authority houses. There should be a waiver in the differential rents scheme for all pensioners and they should be placed on a minimum rent which is lower than the norm and should not be increased. That they reach pension age and are on a pension should be enough to indicate these people are on a lower income bracket and, therefore, the minimum rent should apply. When the pension is increased in a budget or at any other time during the year, that should not be reflected in a further take by the local authority through rent. This can be addressed only by interaction between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of local authority charges, a matter which I have raised on a number of occasions. When charges, such as the refuse charge, are levied by a local authority, a minimum charge should be introduced for pensioners and the local authority should be asked to factor the collection of only a minimum charge from pensioners into the overall cost of that rate. Pensioners are easily defined because there are not many of them in local authority areas. Therefore, local authorities should be capable of dealing with pensioners in a positive but biased way and request far less than the norm from them for the cost of those services.</P>
    <P>Pensioners should also be exempt from library fees and other such charges. While these may be minor charges, they make a huge difference to pensioners who receive a very basic payment from the State. To give them that payment and take it back in local authority charges simply defeats the Minister's purpose in introducing pension increases in the budget.</P>
    <P>We debated the motion on car testing costs in Private Members' time. The State should have a policy of positive discrimination in favour of pensioners. The Department introducing such a scheme should factor into its overall costs provision for the extra burden or the financial costs of a minimum costs scheme for pensioners.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowance should be paid to pensioners all year round. Given that they need heat all year, it is ridiculous that their needs should be acknowledged for only a part of the year. This payment should be increased to equal the cost of a cylinder of gas or a bag of coal. There is nothing <Col N="620" /> radical about that &ndash; it is essential. It is ridiculous that we overlook the cost of the item to which the scheme refers, in this case the fuel scheme. The fuel allowance does not equate with the cost of a cylinder of gas or a bag of coal.</P>
    <P>The foundation for the success of the economic boom was laid by those who are now pensioners. We as legislators should go out of our way to recognise this. The excellent weekly wage brought home by most people far exceeds the pensions paid to those who helped create the wealth in the first place. That is true right across the economy particularly given current wage levels. Older people in our community receive a paltry payment from the State when compared to their years of service in building the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to deal with the question of carers. While I acknowledge the positive steps taken by the Minister, carers must be recognised for the invaluable work they do. Having met carers' representatives, I ask the Minister consider the following suggestions either now or as part of future policy. Income disregard for married couples should be £250 per week. The disregard is currently £150 and it has not been changed in the past three budgets. The income disregard for single people should be £125 a week. This year's budget brings the rate of carer's allowance to £80. This allowance should be £100 and the Minister should re-examine this area in the context of the current Bill to see if there is any room for further improvement.</P>
    <P>The means test is an important issue. While we cannot abandon the means test and allow the gates to be opened, some amendment is necessary. We should confine the allowance to those who are not in a sound financial position. The means test should apply to the carer's income only, setting aside the income of the spouse. If the test were abolished it would prevent the wealthy from claiming it but it would safeguard those who cannot claim at present and who should be able to claim. This is perhaps a positive form of individualisation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take my points into consideration in this Bill and in future policy.</P>

      <P>The Government benches have made much of this Social Welfare Bill. They have hailed it as a major contribution towards the elimination of poverty and no doubt they will continue to pat the Minister on the back for the increases provided in the old age pension. While I accept there are some commendable measures in the Bill, most of them are add-on. They were not central to the budget announced by the Minister for Finance on 1 December. Many of the positive elements of the Bill would not have come about without the extensive pressure exercised by the Opposition, the trade union <Col N="621" /> movement and the community and voluntary sector who were involved in the recent partnership negotiations.</P>
      <P>This Social Welfare Bill fails to address some crucial anomalies which continue to exist in our social welfare system. We are now in a financial position to deliver a social welfare system which is characterised by clarity and equity and not the anomalies and the complexities which have been the order of the day until now. I will address some of the Bill's shortcomings and raise with the Minister some of the glaring problems the Bill presents.</P>
      <P>A fundamental problem with this Bill is the decision to introduce a new PRSI exemption for low paid workers. This exemption has come about because the Government failed to award decent tax breaks to low paid workers in the budget. As a reflex action to the public revolt to the budget, a decision was made at Government level to effectively raid the PRSI fund instead of rewriting the flawed tax reforms announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day. The decision to substitute tax cuts with reductions in PRSI is a fundamentally flawed policy. It is wrong and will not benefit any person in the long term. The social insurance fund exists because it is necessary. It is basically a savings account which can be used to fund disability, dental and maternity benefits. The Government's decision to make PRSI cuts instead of tax cuts for the low paid undermines the integrity of this fund and is unacceptable. Instead of paring back on this fund we should build it up so we can provide more secure pensions or introduce new social welfare insurance based payments such as parental leave payment or a more enhanced maternity benefit.</P>
      <P>This new social insurance exemption introduces a new anomaly. A low paid employee earning £226 per week will be exempt from paying PRSI. However, if a low paid worker earns £226.50 per week he or she must pay the full rate of PRSI. The result of this anomaly &ndash; perhaps I should call it a poverty trap &ndash; is that low income earners will struggle to keep their incomes below the exemption limit. If they accept an increase in wages of £5, for example, they will be worse off. This does not make sense and it is probably indicative of the rush job done by the Government in an attempt to cover up the damage done by the budget.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill could have achieved a great deal. However, it seems the Minister views himself only as an administrator and not as a policy-maker. The Bill lacks vision and it also lacks the will to make our social welfare system comprehensive and modern, reflecting the type of society in which we live. We live in a society where self-employment and atypical work arrangements are more prevalent in workplaces. However, the social welfare system is so far behind that it fails to reflect this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my constituents recently submitted correspondence to the Minister in respect of her rate of maternity benefit. This women runs a small <Col N="622" /> business with her husband, employs staff and complies with the tax and social welfare codes but, because she was on maternity leave during the 1997-98 tax year, she is entitled to only a reduced rate of maternity benefit during her maternity leave this year. If one of her employees went on maternity leave during the same period, she would be entitled to the full rate of benefit provided her PRSI record was up to date. The social welfare information booklet states that women who pay S1 contributions &ndash; which the woman in question pays &ndash; are entitled to maternity benefit. That is misleading because she is not entitled to the full amount and I want the Minister to address that matter when he replies to the debate. This is a very serious issue.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the Government is calling on women to return to the workplace. It introduced a divisive individualisation of the tax system as a stick which can be used to beat women into returning to work. At the same time, however, the Government is not doing enough to make workplaces more family friendly. Ireland has one of the worst records on maternity payments and paternal leave arrangements in the EU and it is time we got our act together.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Social Welfare Bill which is most disappointing is the provision for increases in basic social welfare payments such as disability allowance and unemployment assistance. The logic used by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in awarding minimum increases to people on the lowest social welfare payments is warped. I understand he is of the view that the jobs market is so good that it is not now necessary to look after the people who are in receipt of these payments. However, this warped logic fails to recognise that some people on unemployment assistance and disability allowance have, and always will have, problems accessing the labour market. Employers' prejudices, a lack of skills or poverty of the kind which makes it difficult for people to purchase a suit of clothes to wear to an interview are among some of the difficulties these people face. The Government has decided to ignore those difficulties. Is the Minister not aware that those on disability allowance are ill? Instead of supporting these people and recognising their position, he chooses to penalise them.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to ease the means test for the carer's allowance is outrageous. This failure sends a message to the thousands of people who have sacrificed their jobs and, in many cases, their leisure time to care for a loved one. The Government has failed to recognise that the service which carers provide saves this country millions of pounds. The fewer carers there are, the fewer hospital beds will be available. The new carer's benefit will be of no value to existing carers.</P>
    <P>I could speak about this Bill at greater length but I wish to hand over to my colleague, Deputy Shortall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of a booming econ<Col N="623" /> omy, the availability of reasonably good wages and a rise in the cost of living, the Social Welfare Bill can be described only as a miserable effort on the Government's behalf. The proposed increases will barely keep pace with inflation and, in real terms, social welfare recipients will not be any better off as a result of the Bill. When compared to the increase in wages which others will receive, the increase in their incomes will be negligible. No attempt has been made to link social welfare payments to wages which is obviously a sore point with many social welfare recipients, particularly pensioners. I agree with Deputy McGuinness who made that point strongly.</P>
      <P>Little or no effort has been made to introduce significant reforms to the social welfare system. The current system is outdated and it does not cater for the needs of a large number of people who, for one reason or another, find themselves out of paid employment. There is very little flexibility in the system and it has been amended and tinkered with so much that it must be thrown out. We must start over with a new, more flexible system which is a great deal more relevant to people's circumstances.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on the effect the Bill will have on families. The Minister is presiding over a Social Welfare Bill which ensures that those families on the lowest incomes remain embedded in poverty. The Bill represents a lost opportunity because we have failed to recognise the needs of families on low incomes and those who care for the elderly, the disabled and children. The Minister, in common with the Minister for Finance, seems to view people solely in terms of their ability to engage in paid employment. That displays a complete and utter disregard of the other facets of people's lives, namely, their needs and the demands which are placed on them in terms of engaging in unpaid caring work. No effort has been made to recognise those needs.</P>
      <P>An important element of the Social Welfare Bill is the manner in which the social welfare code currently treats couples compared to parents who live apart. I refer here to lone parents who live apart from their partners. Attention has been drawn to this problem for many years and no serious effort has been made to tackle it. At present, because of the way the social welfare system operates, parents stand to lose up to 30% of their incomes if they chose to marry or live together. The Social Welfare Bill does nothing to address this disincentive and it sends out a signal that the State is not prepared to support those parents who wish to live together to jointly rear their children. As public policy, this is atrocious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a couple, one of whom is in receipt of a one parent family payment and the other is in receipt of a social welfare payment, opt to live together, cohabit or get married &ndash; any of these options are in their children's best interests &ndash; they will lose £32.60 per week. Their total income would be £129.60 and by choosing to do the right thing by their children they would lose £32.60. How could <Col N="624" /> that be right? The total income of a couple where one partner is in receipt of a lone parent family allowance and the other works for a low income amounts to £215 per week. However, by choosing to get married, that couple loses £76 per week. How could any couple on a low income possibly sustain that level of loss? It is any wonder that so many couples are living apart in those circumstances because they know it is in their financial interest to do so? That is bad public policy which is driving parents apart and working against the interests of their children.</P>
    <P>A couple in that scenario who chooses to cohabit is treated even more harshly because the tax code militates against cohabiting couples. Where one member of the couple is working full-time on a low income and the other is in receipt of a one parent family payment and has a part-time job, their total income amounts to £271 per week if they are living apart. If they choose to live together, which we should be trying to encourage and which is the best for their children, they stand to lose £98.26 per week.</P>
    <P>Those figures speak for themselves. Is there any justification for a system which treats couples like that? A system which continues this policy is profoundly anti-family and anti-children. I am bitterly disappointed the Minister has ignored the facts and has avoided the opportunity to address this most urgent issue. I call on him to rethink that. His officials are well aware of the huge disincentives for two parent families. I urge him to take action to address this matter without delay.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the Minister's attitude to people involved in caring activities. Most parents' first choice is to take time out of the workforce to look after their children at home, at least in the early years. The budget and this Bill do nothing for those people who are trying to do their best for their children. There is no improvement in the rates of maternity benefit. Parental leave was introduced in a fairly meaningless way and on the strictest possible terms. There has been a very low uptake of parental leave, simply because it is not paid. I ask the Minister to consider the systems that operate in almost every other European state. The work parents do in rearing their children, which many people would say is the most vital and important work anybody could do, is given no recognition by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Our system is light years behind what happens in most other European countries, in terms of providing financial support to parents to take time out from the workforce to look after their children at home. Most people are bitterly disappointed that the budget and the Bill have done nothing to recognise the expenses involved in child care, whether by a parent taking time out or paying for child care outside the home.</P>
    <P>The provisions in regard to the carer's allowance are also very disappointing. The Government does not seem to recognise that people who give of their time and effort to care for elderly relatives or incapacitated people at home save the <Col N="625" /> State thousands of pounds each year. The Minister should consider abolishing the means test. The Government seems to have established the principle of individualisation in the tax code. It is much more urgent for that to be done in relation to social welfare, where people are means tested on the basis of their spouse's income. This is not good enough. A person should be given due recognition for looking after an incapacitated person. A person who is already in receipt of a social welfare payment gets no additional recognition for being a full-time carer.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for pre-1953 credits. That is to be welcomed, as far it goes. However, a flaw in it is that it does not allow recipients of contributory old age pensions on reduced rate pensions to top-up their pensions. Attention should be given to that. Also, there is no means by which consideration of pre-1953 credits can allow someone to qualify for a retirement pension.</P>
    <P>In regard to the housing crisis, I do not know if the Minister is aware of the contribution scheme which operates very successfully, certainly in the Dublin area, under which elderly people can sell houses back to the local authority and avail of senior citizen accommodation. A major stumbling block to that very innovative scheme is the fact that a person on a social welfare allowance fails the means test when he or she gets a lump sum from the sale of the house. This is inhibiting the operation of that important scheme. The Minister should pay attention to that. When I contacted officials in the Department they seemed unaware of the scheme. This needs urgent attention.</P>
    <P>There are problems in regard to maternity benefit where a child is born prematurely and has to spend time in hospital. I have come across a number of cases where the mother had to return to work before the child came home from hospital. That is unfair and unjust and urgent attention must be paid to it.</P>

      <P>We all welcome this Bill on a number of fronts. The proposed increases, despite what was said in the House, are well in excess of what can be expected with regard to inflation in the coming year. The increase in old age contributory pensions of almost 8%, for example, shows the Government's commitment to look after our senior citizens and those dependent on social welfare for the major part of their income. Deputy Shortall might feel aggrieved at this, especially in view of the fact that the total increase given by the last Government in its last two years in office was 9.9%.

      <P>We have been able to give that because of the way this economy has grown. That shows how the economy has been managed over recent years. I know the truth can be very hurtful in politics but in this case&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it is very hurtful to show that the great socialists when last in Government were unable to make any major improvement for old age pensioners and others.</P>
      <P>When we look at the increases that have taken place across the spectrum of social welfare as a result of the budget and this Bill, we see there are changes of benefit to all sections. We can all identify anomalies, some of which were identified by Deputy Shortall tonight. I can identify an anomaly in regard to ESB meter readers who are on contract to the ESB. They are forced to pay PRSI contributions from which they can receive no benefit. This group should be looked at to see what can be done to alleviate their problems. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has said they are entitled to pay the full rate but their employer, the ESB, has refused to accept that ruling. That should be pursued by the Department. The ESB has threatened some of the workers that if they pursue this to its full conclusion it might make them redundant because they have absolutely no rights. I hope we will be able to do something for this group in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> The changes made in regard to capital allowances for old age pensioners are to be welcomed. If those capital allowances had been in place before, some of the robberies and muggings of old people over the years might not have happened. Pensioners often believe their money is safer kept in their houses. As a result of the changes announced in the Bill, these people will no longer be forced to keep money at home but will be able to place it in savings accounts on which the first £10,000 per individual will be exempt. This measure is long overdue and will encourage people to refrain from keeping money in their homes.</P>
    <P>Other groups are also experiencing difficulties. For example, the unemployed are finding it difficult despite increases in unemployment benefits. In many cases, these people are not able to obtain work due to lack of transport or geographic location, or the fact that there are no employment opportunities in their areas. We have to examine what steps can be taken to reduce the number of people unemployed. There has been a major reduction in unemployment levels in the past few years but we must encourage more people to seek employment and we must make it attractive for them to work. This is an important consideration when examining the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>It is also important that people perceive the code as being equitable and fair. Some people complain about the fact that they are not entitled to certain benefits to which their neighbours are entitled. However, in many such cases, if people fully understood the social welfare code they would appreciate why they are debarred from such payments.</P>
    <P>Social welfare officers must also take a more tolerant approach to investigations. People have complained to public representatives that social welfare officers have been hard on them and intrusive in the nature of their investigations. These officers have a job to do but they have gone beyond acceptable standards during some interviews. It is wrong of them to make accusations which people have to deny and produce documentation to back up their denials. People are entitled to receive in writing accusations made against them by social welfare officers and they should also be entitled to know who made the accusations. This issue should be considered by the Department.</P>
    <P>All Members accept that the carer's allowance has made a significant contribution to the care of the elderly at home and we understand the overall benefits which accrue to the State from such efforts. People cared for at home during illness or old age produce major savings as they are not forced into geriatric hospitals or nursing homes where the State would have to pay subventions and other payments. We should consider a system under which the first 80% of family income is excluded from assessment of means. This is a new scheme which could be of major benefit to the families of carers and those being cared for if it <Col N="628" /> were more widely applicable. As the scheme develops I hope a greater proportion of family income will be excluded from the means test. We do not want a situation where everyone qualifies, irrespective of means. However, this scheme could make a major contribution.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the increases announced in the budget and the Finance Bill and the fact that they are being introduced one month earlier than in previous years. I hope we will soon reach the goal of the £100 pension, which is within sight, and that increases will apply from 5 April, the same date from which tax free allowance increases apply. We have only one month to go to achieve this objective and that should be the aim of the next budget and social welfare Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for sharing time. This Bill provides for record investment of more than £428 million in social welfare payments, as well as providing for substantial reductions in PRSI and health contributions. The Bill also includes supplementary changes brought about as a result of discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The economy is performing well and annual growth rates in recent years of between 8% and 10% have resulted in new-found wealth. The competitive nature of the economy has also improved but recent economic strides have not filtered through to all sectors of society. Studies produced by the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI highlight that rural and urban poverty is still prevalent. There are also concentrated pockets of long-term unemployment in rural and urban areas.</P>
      <P>We are also experiencing many widespread social problems which need to be addressed in a concerted manner. This Bill provides for a record investment of more than £428 million in social welfare measures. There are increases in rates of social insurance and assistance payments for the elderly and the long-term unemployed, as well as increases in child benefit. There are also improvements in the family income supplement and even more beneficial changes in PRSI rates than originally announced in the budget. These changes will reduce employers' contributions and increase the annual earning ceilings for social insurance contributions. The Bill also allows for an increase in the weekly exemption threshold for the payment of health contributions and an additional provision is being introduced which will provide for a weekly PRSI exemption threshold for employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, before commenting in detail on these changes, I wish to address the future assistance which should be given to carers. All Members know of the great social difficulties carers encounter in carrying out what is invariably a personal act of generosity and commitment to a person unable to care for himself or herself. Until last year, the carer's allowance was available only to a family member taking care of a relative who was unable or incapable of caring for himself or <Col N="629" /> herself. This was a serious deficiency in the social welfare code and all Members were pleased to see this anomaly removed.</P>
    <P>Parts II, III and V of this Bill introduce much needed and continued reform of the carer's allowance. I welcome these changes and commend the Minister for his personal interest and commitment to carers, but more reform will be needed in the coming years. Section 5 of the Bill increases the carer's allowance from £80.50 and £120.80 where the carer is looking after more than one person. Where the carer has attained a pensionable age, the rates are increased to £88.50 and £132.80, respectively.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 to 12 provide for the introduction of a new social insurance scheme of carer's benefits as announced in the budget. The new scheme is designed to facilitate and support those who wish to leave the workforce temporarily to care for older people or for those with disabilities in need of full-time care and attention. The proposed new benefit will be available to those in employment for at least three months and who are working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight prior to commencing full-time caring duties and who satisfy certain contribution conditions.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will be closely linked to the means tested carer's allowance and the weekly rate of payment will be £88.50 in line with the rate of carer's allowance payable to carers aged 66 years or over. The benefit will be payable for a period of 15 months in respect of the same care recipient, during which time the person's employment rights will be protected. Separate legislation dealing with the protection of employment rights in this regard will be introduced by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>Additional increases for child dependants will be payable where appropriate at the same rates as those payable with a carer's allowance. Provision is also being made for an additional payment in cases where a carer is caring for more than one person, as applies to the carer's allowance, and for the payment of a respite care grant. Part V deals with the financial basis for the grant. The grant, which was introduced in 1999, is payable on an annual basis to all recipients of the carer's allowance, prescribed relative's allowance and to people providing full-time care and attention to recipients of the constant attendance allowance.</P>
    <P>Irish society has always had a special place for older people. It is now more important than ever that measures are introduced to help those in retirement who depend on State assistance. This Government recognises the special needs of elderly people and, accordingly, under Part II, section 4, an increase of £7 per week for pensioners aged 66 or over is provided. This will also apply to people on retirement or in receipt of invalidity pension aged 65 or over. A special increase of £5.90 in the standard rate of invalidity pension is being introduced to bring it into line with the standard rate of the widow's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> It has always been a bone of contention that the low paid had to pay PRSI. Section 8 of Part II seeks to address this anomaly.</P>
    <P>As a representative for the constituency of Limerick West, I know personally of the real difficulties being encountered by small farmers. As Deputies Ellis and Michael Moynihan said, there is real concern among the social welfare officers examining these problems. I welcome, therefore, the changes being introduced to the farm assist scheme. At present farmers' net income from self employment, including farming, is assessed at 80%. In addition, where the farmer has child dependants, £100 for each of the first two children and £200 for each subsequent child is disregarded. This section provides for a reduction in the assessment rate from 80% to 70% and for an increase of £100 in the amount of income disregarded for child dependants.</P>
    <P>The changes being introduced by this Bill are far reaching. It is Government policy to help the less well off. We do not want to build a society of haves and have-nots, we want to build a society in which all people can actively participate. The changes announced by the Government are part of a long-term policy and I am confident there will be further substantial changes in next year's budget to help those in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual that Opposition Members do not get as enthused by social welfare Bills, or any other Government legislation, as Ministers and Government backbenchers. There are some positive contributions in the Bill but it goes without saying that it is an after thought following public reaction to the budget. These changes were not provided for in the Social Welfare Bill as it was then anticipated. This Bill bears no relationship to the legislation as it was originally conceived.</P>
      <P>While some of the issues referred to by Members opposite are addressed, there are many others outstanding. Members on the Government side constantly talk of the golden figure of £100 for various pensioners. Reaching that target is laudable but it must be remembered that it was an election promise which did not go over board, it merely identified the necessary annual increases and multiplied them by three, four or five. The same could be done for the next ten years if we were to plan for increases on the basis of 5%, 10% or 15% and then identify what the pension should be for particular categories of social welfare recipients at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another issue which has not been mentioned. The Government backbenchers tell the House how pensioners must feel good. The Government believes that if they are told they should feel good, they will feel good but that is not so in this case. The increase of £1 per week was gone before the Social Welfare Bill was introduced for any couple who smoke. In the budget those poor people who have the consolation of <Col N="631" /> a smoke and who thought they were getting an increase had it taken away from them.</P>

      <P>Then comes the real peach &ndash; inflation. When Members on the Government side were in Opposition they used to harangue the then Government because they reckoned there were not sufficient increases in excess of inflation. At 4% inflation is twice as high as it was then. What increase is there for the person who smokes two packs of cigarettes a week when inflation is taken into account? The feel good factor emanating from Deputies on the Government side, in an attempt to make those people feel better, is not working.</P>
      <P>We have been told over the years of the importance of the young generation and that we must look after them. Everyone in the House wants adequate child benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">

      <P>Once again I am astounded that no provision was made for inflation. No recognition was given to the fact that it is increasing to its highest level for ten years. It is extraordinary that there was no provision for inflationary rises in the cost of living. People affected will have to put up with the Government trying to generate a feel good factor, as well as with inflation. How will they feel? The Government parties should go to the plinth on another pilgrimage and apologise to those unfortunate people for misleading them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Government on introducing some badly needed improvements for carers. They are appreciated as people who make a serious contribution, economically and socially, to the State. In that climate the improvements are gratefully accepted. It must be remembered, however, that there is a long way to go. If the Government wanted to set down benchmarks it should state that each year for the next five years it will provide more money for the 20,000 carers who provide free care. Without their intervention, at great personal sacrifice, hospitals and <Col N="632" /> other such institutions would be crowded to an extent that would not be contemplated today. There is, therefore, considerable room for improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to deciding officers and their decisions. Having had experience in this area, I believe they have a difficult job at the best of times. To be fair, and apart from one or two exceptions over the years, such as the women's equality payments, decisions made in the Department are not set in tablets of stone. Other Departments are notorious for doing this. It must be emphasised that decisions should not be made in this way to the extent that the only recourse available to people who wish to appeal them is through the courts. If this were to be the norm the courts would be crowded. There must always be an appeals mechanism. This is provided for in this Department, but not in others.</P>
    <P>The issue of women in the home was forgotten in the budget. The initial response to the Minister's Budget Statement was euphoric because of the billions of pounds that were thrown at the public. However, a number of groups who made a huge contribution to society were ignored. It was an extraordinary oversight, especially when in the months leading up the budget they were told it was not a question of whether, but how much, the Government would help them.</P>
    <P>Despite prompting from other areas, the alarm bells were raised in this House by my colleague, Deputy Noonan, who was the first to raise the question of the treatment of women in the home. He did so very effectively, to the extent that the Government had to burn the midnight oil to find a few more pounds as upstanding and outraged Government backbenchers, some of whom are no longer such, stood on the plinth of the House and condemned the unfortunate Minister for Finance, who was only doing what the Government had jointly and severally agreed on. It was appalling.</P>
    <P>The Government managed to get its act together and made changes to its budgetary strategy. It found a couple of more million of pounds, opened the hat once more and plucked another one or two rabbits. As a result, we have now begun to address an issue which the Government failed to recognise earlier. I do not understand how that could have happened because everybody here read the newspapers and listened to the reactions to the budget. While the Government's response was a damp squib, I compliment the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on recognising, even belatedly, that a number of issues needed to be addressed, including that of women who have spent years looking after their families, some in the home full-time and some part-time.</P>
    <P>When debating social welfare Bills the Opposition is at a huge disadvantage because goodies are dispersed from the other side of the House. The Minister is usually the first to declare that the biggest ever increases in social welfare benefits have been provided for, as if it was a development unique to that year's budget and despite the <Col N="633" /> fact that every social welfare Bill provides for the biggest increases ever because people will be paid more. It would, after all, be unwise to provide for, or say, the opposite, notwithstanding the inflation rates to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I get tired of hearing the mantra of the biggest ever increases in social welfare benefits or the biggest ever budget giveaway. How could any Government introduce the smallest budget ever? How could a Minister justify that course of action? Even without the people on the plinth he would not get far.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of poverty traps, overlaps and the kind of measure that causes difficulties for individual cases. Although there will always be some of them, greater time and energy should be put into refining budgetary and social welfare provisions. When an anomaly is identified it is always possible to resolve it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister. I was lost in the vacuum that existed in his absence.</P>

      <P>The issue of <i>pro rata</i> pensions has preoccupied me for many years. The Minister addressed some aspects last year and when my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, and I were in Government we had the pleasure of addressing others in a previous Social Welfare Bill. However, there are still outstanding matters. The phrase &ldquo;<i>pro rata</i>&rdquo; indicates something that does not necessarily apply. It should mean that once one has achieved a certain level of contributions it should be possible to ensure that payment is <i>pro rata</i> in accordance with the contributions made over a period of years. Notwithstanding the P53 provisions and, more especially, the self-employed and PAYE provisions, which are equally affected because of the lack of the five year contributions, all outstanding areas can be addressed. The pension payable to the recipient or the applicant may not be great, but it would at least recognise the contribution made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ellis referred to an employee who is bound to make contributions but can never benefit from them. That is wrong and unnecessary, although it may have been necessary when the national budgetary framework was not as it is now. It is possible to address those issues. I ask the Minister to establish in the course of the year a group in his Department to identify the snags, <Col N="634" /> poverty traps and pitfalls which have developed with the passage of time and to address them at the earliest opportunity. Addressing them may mean very little in overall budgetary terms, but such issues have a serious impact on those directly affected, namely, the applicants. This is an area which could be very constructively addressed and it would be useful for the Minister and the Department to do so. I know a social welfare Bill is supposed to do that in any event. However, that does not happen simply because there are too many other pressing and competing demands, and neither the Minister nor the Department can get around to do the work to which I am referring which requires a much longer run-in period.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the good work he has done, but point out that there are many areas to which he has not attended. I chide the Minister and the Government for hyping expectation to such an extent and attempting to cod the poor unfortunate recipients of social welfare into the mistaken belief that they are on top of the world when they are barely holding onto the tiger's tail by a very small hair. I say this in the context of the points I made relating to the increase in the budget in duties on tobacco and the rise in the rate of inflation. I am not saying everybody should smoke, but the increase affects some people more than others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Cecilia Keaveney.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill. The Minister has introduced major improvements in the past two and a half years. I usually have to consult my social welfare directory when people ask me about entitlements. We cannot say what the new entitlements will be until the budget is passed, the Social Welfare Bill is published and the partnership agreement is concluded.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes made by the Minister in the method of assessment of capital, the introduction of a new scheme of carer's benefit, a widow's parent grant and a special contributory pension for people with pre-1953 insurance. I also welcome the progress made towards the £100 target for lower rates of social welfare payments. The Minister has gone a considerable way by increasing old age contributory pensions by £7, and retirement pensions to £96 per week, which is ahead of target. I hope we will reach our target of £100 for non-contributory old age pensions very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will address the fuel scheme which elderly people find of great benefit. It should be extended for a longer period with the level of benefit increased, as it has not been increased for some time. In that regard, I welcome the announcement by the Minister for State, Deputy Molloy, regarding home heating under the housing aid for the elderly scheme. This is a very important move forward. We should have had a millennium project to help elderly people through a heating scheme, and this goes some <Col N="635" /> way in that direction. However, given the number of people seeking assistance under the scheme, perhaps the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will examine the issue of further improvements.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made approximately 21 changes for carers since becoming Minister, which are to be welcomed. A challenge facing the Minister and all of us is the significant increase in the number of carers over the years. There are currently almost 15,000 carers, an increase of 60%. We must provide for a further increase in the number of carers. People entitled to carer's allowance qualify for the free scheme, which is very important. I welcome the greater flexibility in the scheme following the relaxing of the residency qualifying conditions. The Minister is selling himself short by referring to non-resident carers as broadly encompassing people who live next door as the scheme is better than this. People who live down the road from the person being cared for and who qualify under a community alert or neighbourhood watch scheme, and who have a security system in place through such schemes, can also be included. Phonewatch, for example, is one of the very successful schemes operating in this regard. I welcome the fact that many people are wearing alarm pendants which they can use to alert people if they need help.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the carer's scheme has been extended. It safeguards the needs and interests of care recipients, which is very important as was pointed out at a recent meeting with carers. The issue of the means test will be raised in the context of applications for carer's allowance. During discussion on the last Social Welfare Act I called on the Minister to examine the means test as the cost is increasing and there are more carers. The carers' association would like the means test abolished. The income disregard of £75 in the case of a single carer and £150 in the case of a married couple has not been increased, as I believe it should have been. There should be a scheme similar to the nursing home subvention scheme which has three rates of payment relating to the level of care, namely, £75, £90 and £120. Carer's benefit is very welcome and will allow carers to avail of protected leave of absence from work for a period of up to 15 months. Carer's benefit is not subject to a means test and the scheme should be straightforward.</P>
    <P>The back to work and back to education allowances have been extended to carers when they cease caring. The back to work scheme includes a condition that the applicant must be an additional employee, something with which I agree, but there seems to be some difficulty in relation to people who do shift work. Perhaps they are not working the necessary number of hours, but I would like them catered for. The back to education scheme is excellent for people who cease caring or for students who drop out of college. However, it is necessary to help people return to education more quickly, as I have seen cases <Col N="636" /> where students have had to wait up to five years to benefit from the scheme. I am sure the Minister will support what I say in this regard.</P>
    <P>There have also been changes to the family income supplement which are very welcome. The weekly income thresholds have been increased and the minimum payment has been increased from £5 to £10 per week. The scheme is very useful in helping families.</P>
    <P>Regarding pensions for people with pre-1953 insurance, the Minister said this was the first phase of a review providing 50% of the maximum personal rate to people with five years or 260 social insurance contributions, or a combination of pre-1953 and post 1953 contributions. This latter provision is important because people who do not have five years contributions prior to 1953 will benefit greatly if they can combine their pre and post 1953 contributions. However, as mentioned by Deputy Ellis, those who are self-employed had to have ten years contributions. Many farmers benefited under the scheme. The Minister then introduced a five year <i>pro rata</i> pension which was welcome. However, a number of people were born after 1927 and they are not eligible for this pension. One individual who was born on 24 April 1927 told me that he missed out on eligibility for the scheme by 19 days. Such individuals should qualify for the pre-1953 pension.</P>
    <P>Some Members have said for years that the capital assessment for social welfare bears little relation to the return on investment. The Minister has moved quickly to ensure that the first £10,000 of capital is completely disregarded and I welcome its introduction. In the past he reduced the assessment rate for the farm assist scheme from 100% to 80% and he is further reducing that to 70%. He has also provided for an increase of £100 in the child income disregard and this scheme also applies to fishermen. These improvements are most welcome given the difficulties faced by farmers over the past year.</P>
    <P>An additional £1,000 will be provided to a widowed person with children through the bereavement grant. The cost of funerals is increasing and health boards can only allocate a set amount. We could have a useful debate on the cost of funerals because it can be exorbitant, as has been pointed out by other Members. The Minister cannot provide the solution to this issue but he is doing his best in the provision of bereavement grants.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides that an unemployed person can qualify for unemployment benefit or assistance, whichever is more beneficial, and that is useful for those who try to join a community employment scheme. Extended child benefit and other benefits, such as free fuel, can be paid. I very much welcome that. Improvements could be made in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to allow more FÁS workers qualify for schemes because it is difficult to find suitable people to take up <Col N="637" /> such schemes as a result of some conditions which must be complied with.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the needs of the elderly, carers and people who are dependent on social welfare for income support. I welcome the fact that the Minister has obtained the resources from the Department of Finance to make these improvements. His budget has been increased by £252 million this year and by £428 million in a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Ireland is doing well under its current Administration and people almost take for granted the increases that are announced each year. While it is human nature to always wish for more and for Opposition Members to belittle all the extremely positive news contained in this Bill, one should objectively examine the facts. In this context, I refer to the Social Welfare Bill, 1997, which was the first to be introduced in my time as a Member.</P>
      <P>Anyone who compares both Bills will see how well the Minister is doing in obtaining the finances he needs. Anyone who examines his mission statements when he took up office and the facts and statistics will see that his ideals and those of the programme for Government are being implemented. There are indications that the figures that might have seemed aspirational to some at that time are on course to be surpassed. I congratulate the Minister on his work, especially in regard to the building of an inclusive society and in improving the living standards of those on social welfare. Deputy Durkan stated that it would have been a surprise if the Minister provided less than he did last year, but he missed the fact that people must generate the revenue in order to provide such increases. It does not happen by magic.</P>
      <P>The social inclusion commitments entered into by the Government with the social partners in the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, together with the Minister's input, will form a solid basis for economic prosperity for all in the coming years. The agreement will progress in real terms all rates of social welfare, provide continued improvement for pensioners and increase the monthly child benefit to £100 a month for the third child and others. As a result of this Bill, a family of three children will receive £141 per month, an increase of £26, and this is a pro-family measure. I refer Opposition Members to the Social Welfare Bill, 1997, which provided for an increase of 25p per week. At the time it would not have bought a bar of chocolate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth reiterating just how significant are the changes and the total spend in this budget. The core package was £403 million, but that has since been increased to £428 million, and it is aimed at the elderly, people with disabilities and the low paid. A total of £103 million in PRSI and health contribution levies has been provided for the low paid. The overall budget of £531 million puts the Minister's previous budgets, totalling <Col N="638" /> £316 million in 1999 and £225 million in 1998, in the shade.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to go through all the increases one by one but I am interested in assistance for workers, the unemployed and pensioners. There has been movement towards delivering a £100 per week pension for the latter group. The review of An Action Programme for the Millennium is well on course and by 2002 the pension will be in excess of the £100. An added positive element within this is the fact that payments will be brought forward to the first week of May, one month earlier than usual. It is even better that the Minister has undertaken to bring that date forward again next year to the first week of April. This is only right when one considers that the negative aspects of any budget, such as increases in the prices of petrol and cigarettes, are implemented almost immediately after the Minister for Finance's speech.</P>
    <P>Many people await the conclusion of the review of eligibility for the retirement and old age contributory pensions because it is examining the current yearly average test compared to the idea of a &ldquo;total contributions&rdquo; approach. Most Members can highlight examples of people who have felt badly treated by the current system and in commending the conclusion of the first phase of the review I look to the end of this year and the completion of the exercise set.</P>
    <P>However, there are improvements in the Bill this year for pre-1953 contributors and the general changes to the structure of the retirement and old age contributory pension rate bands from five to three rates will assist 38,000 people. The new disregard of £10,000 for assessment purposes will be welcomed by a large number of people. Often people with a relatively low level of capital have felt that the assessment was unduly harsh. They felt that they were penalised for every pound they had. The new system that will come into effect in October will help many pensioners and welfare claimants to retain their full pension entitlement and in that context it is interesting that 88% of pensioners with capital surveyed by the Department had less than £10,000.</P>
    <P>People who need to be cared for, such as the elderly or those with a disability, are acknowledged in an extremely pleasing manner in the Bill. A range of measures cover not only direct financial help but also services, and the work that is done is reflected in the fact that the number in receipt of carer's allowance has increased by 60% and expenditure has almost doubled. The extension of the free schemes to carers is extremely important as was the increase of £100 in the respite care grant announced last year. The Minister acknowledged in his contribution that more had to be done and, therefore, new people have been given the chance to opt in. They can give up work temporarily to care full time while still maintaining their employment rights and gaining the entitlement to £88.50 that is not means tested for up to 15 months. Those who fulfil this role are not in an ideal situation but often they have been <Col N="639" /> forced out of work due to circumstances at home and were not able to avail of help. This is an extremely important innovation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, unemployment in my constituency is four times the national average. It has been heavily reliant on fishing, farming and Fruit of the Loom type industries. There have been 1,600 redundancies over the past 18 months. The budget and this Bill provide improvements to unemployment assistance and the various schemes. There is a decrease in assessment rates from 80% to 70% and an increase of £100 per annum in the child income disregards for farm assist and for low income self-employed fishermen claiming unemployment assistance. An important announcement last year for coastal communities such as my own was the new fishing and farm assist arrangements under the unemployment assistance scheme. The assessment of 80% of their income from self-employment; the similar £100 and £200 disregards for the farm assist scheme; and the relaxation of the signing on arrangements meant a lot to those on low income who have suffered from prolonged bad weather. As I stated, the new improvements are all the more welcome.</P>
    <P>While the other social welfare payments are well above the rate of inflation and most welcome, there are a number of people in my constituency who would prefer not to have to avail of the newly increased social welfare payments. The many people who were laid off from Fruit of the Loom, the Donegal shirt factory, Jockey Underwear, Glenveagh Mushrooms, the Fingal shirt factory, Dromont shirt factory, Jay Bees shirt factory and so on continue to impress on us their wish to have replacement work provided. I take this opportunity to reiterate their commitment to work and extol their work ethos and capability. I look forward to continued pressure being exerted on all agencies to ensure increased job creation in Inishowen and Donegal North-East generally. I also look forward to the day when our unemployment statistics come down in line with national trends.</P>
    <P>For those on the lower wage rate, I welcome the improvements for those families in danger of falling into the poverty trap. The weekly income threshold increases that will lead to an increase of £8 per week in the average FIS payment, and the new regulation that will raise the minimum payment from £5 to £10 will have a significant impact on many families. Under section 20, a spouse in a family with two children can now earn £90 per week in part-time work and still benefit by an additional £38 under the new system. This is a positive measure that families can look forward to in May.</P>
    <P>I welcome the work being done by FÁS, the partnerships, Leader companies and other agencies to provide opportunities to retrain and acquire skills. There are also improvements for people working on community employment schemes. I welcome the fact that the Minister has <Col N="640" /> recognised those who are suffering a bereavement with a £500 grant last year and £1,000 for those widowed this year. I ask the Minister to examine the position of ESB meter readers and reiterate the case Deputy Ellis made here earlier. I trust their case can be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill which will greatly improve the lives of many people. The Opposition will always call for more and belittle what has been done, but when one looks at the facts, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is doing as much for social welfare as we would want him to do. The people in his Department work very hard in accommodating the many requests from us for information. I look forward to the next two Bills of the five year programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. There are many positive aspects to the Social Welfare Bill. It is important legislation, introduced in the House annually, outlining what is being done for the people who can least afford the benefits of our rising standard of living. It is difficult for social welfare recipients to keep pace with those who have a job, are more privileged and benefit from the increasing wealth generated in the economy.</P>
      <P>Introducing the Bill, the Minister said that the package of measures is central to a comprehensive framework of policies costing £1.5 billion which the Government will introduce to combat exclusion in the coming years and to ensure full participation for all citizens in our society. I have difficulty with some aspects of that statement. The Minister is in a privileged position on this occasion, but many of his predecessors did not have the resources at their disposal which are now available to the Minister. In the past, Ministers for Social Welfare would have had to increase taxes on some people in order to alleviate some of the hardship on those in greatest need by way of increasing the old age pension, children's allowances and so on. The Minister has huge resources at his disposal. He has allocated £530 million to people on low incomes, yet a huge section of our society has not benefited. That is a damnation. Regardless of whether we like it, one quarter of our school children are poor and the depth of their poverty is increasing. That is difficult to reconcile with all the plaudits for this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have worked as a teacher and I saw at first hand the difficulty faced by many school children, whether at primary or second level. For any system to benefit those children who are in need, great discretion is needed. The back to school schemes represent a good system provided they are adequate. The Minister has provided for an increase of £20, and that is welcome, but what does that mean in reality to a child living in pov<Col N="641" /> erty? It means a pencil, a biro, one book or a few copies. If that is what we believe is necessary to combat increasing poverty for one quarter of our children, we have failed our young people miserably. These are the first people to drop out of the education system, at a great cost to society, without training or certification. They are unable to take their place in the workforce. These are the people who get involved in either petty or more serious crime, and that can be the case for the remainder of their lifetime. That results in an enormous cost to the State. The Minister had the opportunity in the Social Welfare Bill to invest in our young people who are stricken by poverty, but the opportunity has passed. I hope he revisits the whole question of poverty among school-going children. Bonuses and additional incomes could be given to certain people on low incomes. We must look after our young people in education.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the farm assist scheme which was launched with great hype and enthusiasm. The reality of the scheme as it is implemented on the ground is that it has been a total failure. If its original intention was anything other than to increase the income of low income farmers in rural Ireland who are on their knees because of low prices, it has failed. We talk about a write-off increase from 70% to 80%, but what does that mean to the people on the ground? It means nothing to the people who have to apply for it. As for those privileged enough to get as far as an appeal, I know of a person who applied in early 1999 but who was assessed and refused. That person appealed in July 1999 and the appeal procedure continued until 12 January this year.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>mindful of Ireland's current and developing national and international security and defence obligations and having regard to the ongoing internal security duties, aid to the civil power and other obligations of the Defence Forces;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>condemns the Minister for Defence for his mishandling of the preparation of the White Paper on the Defence Forces and particularly for the damage caused by his reluctance to engage in a full and meaningful con<Col N="642" /> sultative process with senior military personnel, the representative bodies and the FCA;</P>
    <P>deplores the serious damage to morale resulting from:</P>
    <P>his attempts to reduce the establishment of the Defence Forces without a clear statement of military consequence of this course of action;</P>
    <P>his long delay in publishing the White Paper;</P>
    <P>his failure to implement the PriceWaterhouse recommendations on the Air Corps and Navy, having appointed himself chairperson of the implementation group;</P>
    <P>his poor planning and lack of consultation with the local communities in closing barracks, and</P>
    <P>calls on the Minister for Defence to immediately review the contents of the White Paper to take account of the concerns widely expressed and to bring forward realistic proposals for the future of the Defence Forces, based on Ireland's ongoing defence and peacekeeping commitments at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>When first proposed, the White Paper on Defence was supposed to chart a new course for the Defence Forces. It offered the Minister an opportunity to restore morale and confidence within the Defence Forces after the turbulent events of recent years. It was supposed to prepare our Defence Forces for the new challenges and opportunities that Ireland's expanding role in international peacekeeping presented.</P>
    <P>However, the White Paper has achieved none of these objectives. The Minister has turned his back on an unprecedented opportunity to redefine and refocus the role of our Defence Forces. Instead, he has distorted the White Paper process. Under his tutelage it has descended into little more that a dictatorial cost cutting exercise. The Minister has insulted and angered the representative bodies by his approach to consultation. He has even further undermined morale in the Defence Forces. His attitude has been directly responsible for the most serious breach of trust in living memory, between high ranking military officers and the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence has become a shambles. It does not have the support of the rank and file members of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. It does not have the support of the men and women of the Defence Forces who put their lives on the line for this country. It does not deserve the support of this House.</P>
    <P>Since the early 1990's the Defence Forces have been under a near constant process of review. Under the PriceWaterhouse review, completed in the mid-1990s, the strength of the Forces has been reduced from 13,000 to 11,500. Chronic under investment has led to the Defence Forces <Col N="643" /> being poorly equipped and denied the equipment necessary for a modern force, with major national and international commitments.</P>
    <P>It is time this denigration and depletion of the Defence Forces was brought to a halt. However, the Minister refuses to do so. He has used the White Paper process to pursue a vindictive agenda against the Defence Forces. Personnel are to be cut further, regardless of our expanding international commitments. Investment in the Defence Forces as a percentage of GDP, already the lowest among our European neighbours, will continue to be slashed. The views of the representative bodies will continue to be ignored. The former Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon, writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> three weeks ago said:</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence could send the Defence Forces into terminal decline. This will cause little pain to those who don't appreciate the necessity for Defence Forces. It is an appalling vista for those of us who appreciate the real damage being proposed by those who know little and seem to care less.</P>
    <P>The attitude of both the Minister for Defence and the even more voracious budget slashing tendencies of his colleague the Minister for Finance, have no regard for the tasks and challenges which we expect the Defence Forces to deal with.</P>
    <P>On a national level the Defence Forces play a crucial and expanding role. In common with every other nation's defence forces, they are charged with protecting the State against armed foreign aggression. In addition, the Defence Forces perform a critical role in aid to the civil power duties, particularly along the Border. The role of the Defence Forces in assisting the Garda Síochána in the campaign against violent paramilitary groups has rightfully been acknowledged in this House and elsewhere on many occasions. The Army also escorts prisoners to and from their place of detention to the courts, a role which is expanding given the increasing number of violent gangland cases which have come before the courts in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is charged with fisheries protection duties along our coast, the second largest fishery area in the EU. In addition, it has taken on the increased incidence of major drug trafficking which is plaguing our coast. Significant international drug traffickers have targeted our expansive coastline as a staging post in this illicit and lethal trade. The Naval Service has proudly responded to this new challenge despite the lack of investment in equipment and personnel that has bedevilled it. Likewise, the Air Corps performs vital search and rescue missions which have saved countless lives over the years. It also does a wide range of tasks which the civilian powers require it to do without fear or favour.</P>
    <P>It is important to detail the role of the Defence Forces and it is wrong and inaccurate to underestimate that role in important day to day duties. <Col N="644" /> Due to the discipline and honour of Defence Forces members, they do not seek credit or acknowledgement for it. In recent times they have been subject to some of the most insulting and misplaced comment endured by any group. Some of this comment was fuelled by the scare tactics employed by the Minister in relation to the Army deafness cases taken by some members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It is time this campaign to undermine the Defence Forces was exposed for what it is. I deeply appreciate and respect the men and women who have worn the uniform of this State and I resent the campaign waged unfairly against them over the past two years in particular.</P>
    <P>However, the international role of our Defence Forces which is expanding rapidly. This international role traditionally involved the Defence Forces in UN peacekeeping missions around the world. Irish soldiers have served proudly and honourably in some of the most dangerous regions of the world. Their record is second to none and the ability of our troops to gain the trust and confidence of local communities in some of the world's most turbulent troublespots has enhanced Ireland's international reputation. It is a record of achievement that no doubt plays a key role in Ireland's current campaign to win a seat on the UN security council.</P>
    <P>The rapidly changing nature of regional and international geopolitics places new challenges and demands on our Defence Forces. At present, we have reached our ceiling for troops serving on international missions, with the full complement of 850 troops serving abroad from Lebanon to East Timor. The decision made by this Parliament to join Partnership for Peace will put new demands on the Armed Forces. It must also be taken into account that, in the wake of the Helsinki summit, the prospect of Irish troops being committed to an EU crisis management force of up to 50,000 troops grows ever closer.</P>
    <P>The EU approach to a common foreign and security policy is one of the most important issues facing the Union in the coming years. The inability of the EU to take effective peacekeeping and peace enforcement action during the carnage that gripped the Balkans for most of the 1990s has forced us to examine the regional role and capabilities of the EU. The expansion of the Union over the coming decade means that this issue must be progressed and Ireland cannot shirk its responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>However, it is against this background that the current Minister for Defence insists on further cuts in our Defence Forces which will fundamentally reduce their capability to honour our international commitments. The reduction in personnel outlined in the White Paper published this afternoon flies directly in the face of developments in the European Union, pays lip service to our UN peacekeeping role and seriously undermines our stated commitment to uphold human rights and the principles of democracy.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on two aspects of the <Col N="645" /> White Paper. The first relates to the supposed process of consultation with the representative bodies and the second relates to the content of the White Paper. It is only fair to acknowledge that the Minister facilitated a briefing on the White Paper for Opposition spokespersons this evening.</P>
    <P>RACO and PDFORRA, the representative bodies for Defence Forces personnel, have been treated appallingly by this Minister. In an economy and society that has gained so much from the process of partnership since 1987 it is beyond belief that this principle has been ignored by the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, in relation to both PDFORRA and RACO. For the life of me I cannot understand why the Minister proceeded on a course which has denigrated and offended both these organisations in preparation of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>PDFORRA, the organisation which represents the rank and file members of the Defence Forces, has been granted only one meeting with the Minister on the White Paper in the past year. RACO, which like PDFORRA invested immense time, resources and money in drafting detailed and insightful submissions to the White Paper, has been treated in the same off-hand and dictatorial manner.</P>
    <P>The key point is that the Department of Defence is locked into a structure in which concepts such as consultation and partnership have no meaning. The Minister has never challenged this damaging and all-pervading ethos. He has relied on this structure to facilitate his own irresponsible agenda on the Defence Forces. The consultation process on the White Paper has been little more than a sham. Its conclusions were decided long before consultation with the representative bodies began and the sound and rational proposals made by both PDFORRA and RACO were ignored because they conflicted directly with the short-sighted, penny-pinching attitude which many in this Government have against the Defence Forces. This has led to a lack of trust between the Minister and the representative bodies which is at an all time low, and it is the Minister who must bear full responsibility for this disastrous state of affairs. Time and again at Question Time Deputy Fitzgerald and myself, and indeed colleagues from all parties, have impressed on the Minister the urgent need to tackle the plummeting morale within the Defence Forces. It has rightly been identified as the most serious issue facing the forces now. The Minister has given us assurances that he recognises this challenge and has assured us it is at the top of his agenda.</P>
    <P>However, there is a large gap between the words and actions of the Minister. He has paid lip service to the morale crisis in the Defence Forces. At the same time he has instigated and sustained a policy on the White Paper which can only further erode morale in the forces, make recruitment all the more difficult and sour relations between his office and the representa<Col N="646" /> tive organisations. The events of recent weeks in particular laid bare the hollow words the Minister spoke in this House on so many occasions.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the contents of the White Paper published this afternoon. The rift between the Minister and the most senior staff in the Defence Forces has been apparent for some weeks. The Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General David Stapleton, is one of the most honourable and intelligent men in the public service today. He has been forced into an impossible position by the Minister over his handling of the White Paper. Such was the concern within the Defence Forces that Lieutenant General Stapleton had to meet face to face with the Minister on the White Paper. It has been reported that the Chief of Staff secured concessions from the Minister at this meeting which would be incorporated into the White Paper. Will the Minister confirm that the points agreed at that meeting have been included in the White Paper? Are the commitments given to the Chief of Staff and, by extension, all the men and women under his command incorporated in the White Paper published today?</P>
    <P>The handling of the preparation of the White Paper by the Minister for Defence has damaged our Defence Forces, soured relationships between the Minister and Defence Forces personnel and cast a serious doubt over our ability to fulfil our international peacekeeping commitments. What should have been a unique opportunity to review, reform and revamp our neglected Defence Forces has been reduced to a budget slashing exercise that devalues the proud history and tradition of the Defence Forces since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House this evening demands a halt to the damage which the Minister has caused. It is a motion that warrants the support of each and every Member of this House. In particular, the members of the Progressive Democrats are faced with a crucial choice. They can stand by the sensible comments of their national chairperson, Councillor John Minihan, who in a recent letter to <i>The Irish Times </i>described the White Paper as &ldquo;a cost-cutting, budget capping exercise which will suffocate the future of the Defence Forces&rdquo; and called on the Minister, Deputy Smith, to admit he has made a fundamental mistake in relation to the White Paper and to set in motion a review, or else traipse through the Government lobbies tonight and abandon Councillor Minihan in favour of the dictatorial stance of the Minister for Defence. I fear that the attraction of power which currently grips the Progressive Democrats Members of this House will leave Councillor Minihan as a lone voice.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, the preparation of this White Paper has been one of the most traumatic times for the members of the Defence Forces. They have seen their representative bodies ignored and their proposals rejected out of hand. Morale in the defence forces has yet again been dealt a serious blow by the Minister. It is time the <Col N="647" /> Government realised the damage it is causing. The Minister is leaving in his wake a legacy of bitterness, disappointment and disillusionment. The men and women of our Defence Forces deserve better, they deserve full consultation and real input into the future of the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps. The Minister has singularly failed to facilitate this partnership approach and the White Paper has become the greatest missed opportunity in the history of the Defence Forces. That is the legacy of the Government. It is a shameful record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall and the Labour Party for sharing their time. There is a revised White Paper on Defence, after what has been a tortuous process marked by poor communication and a breakdown in the relationship between the Minister for Defence and the general staff of the military and also by the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Stapleton's early return from East Timor to deal with the crisis. The past few weeks has marked an all-time low in the relationship between the Minister for Defence and the general military staff. It will take more than today's high profile press conference and much needed and much delayed announcements of investment in the Air Corps to repair the serious damage to the relationship between the Minister and the Defence Forces. I regret there has been an undermining of trust between the civil and military authorities charged with the future of the Defence Forces. There are excellent people on both sides. There have been last minute face-saving meetings. There are excellent people working for the future of the Defence Forces and, as Deputy Wall said, it has been a missed opportunity. Agreed changes have not been incorporated into the White Paper but are to be the subject of a further document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister said on the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; tonight that there would be a further revision of the White Paper within three weeks. That is extraordinary. There is the White Paper which was published today, the press release incorporating some of the changes agreed with the Chief of Staff and the document signed by the Minister and the Chief of Staff last Thursday. It appears that at the same time as the White Paper was being printed last week there was agreement between the Chief of Staff and the Minister which was not incorporated into the published version of the White Paper. It is extraordinary. What is the status of this agreement now? Where does it exist? Does it have Cabinet approval? If it is not in the White Paper, what is its status? Where is it written, other than in today's press release? Why has it not been incorporated? Is it a private agreement between the Chief of Staff and the Minister? Why is there no mention in the White Paper of some of the issues which were the subject of such high profile meetings between the Minister and the Chief of Staff? Will the Minister outline <Col N="648" /> the key elements of change which were negotiated and what is their status?</P>
    <P>The representative associations have once again said they are unhappy. It is extraordinary that the White Paper on Defence has been published today and there is still uncertainty about key aspects which appeared last week to be central to the resolution of the concerns expressed by the military to the Minister. As Deputy Wall said, they were the subject of meetings here. It seemed to be an unhappy Chief of Staff who attended today's press conference. He is and has been put in an extraordinarily difficult position unnecessarily. The paucity of the consultative process and the poorness of the original draft of the White Paper has been exposed for all to see. It is doubtful the changes in the White Paper announced by the Minister in the heat of such a breakdown is the best way to chart the future of our Defence Forces nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>In a couple of weeks we have a revised, revisited White Paper instead of a paper borne out of proper consultation with all concerned, the representative associations, members of the Defence Forces, interested parties and the Minister. There appears to have been an inability on the part of the Minister to listen and respond effectively until pressurised by a threat of resignation by the Chief of Staff, a potentially destabilising situation for the Defence Forces and an unprecedented breakdown between the Executive and the Defence Forces. The forces have been characterised throughout their history by great loyalty, discipline and accountability, essential necessities for defence forces. There has been a grudging, back-to-the-wall response to the outrage felt by the initial draft. It is characteristic of the Government's inability to make good decisions and, in this instance, face up to the realities of the needs of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>There has been a painfully slow response to glaring gaps in the Defence Forces in training and equipment, as evidenced by borrowing lorries to train for Kosovo, and to the lack of investment in the Air Corps, with most of the fleet grounded and shortages of spare parts for helicopters. There has been a failure to convince the Minister for Finance of the reality of the needs of the Defence Forces. The Minister has allowed rumours to circulate continuously for almost a year of the Department of Finance's wish to cut back the forces to 8,500. The economics of the White Paper, while presented as a marvel, are suspect and novel in that they are dependent on a cutback in the forces to bring in necessary investment. It is like saying that the health service will be improved without nurses or doctors. Despite the amount of money spent by the Government on consultants, there is an inability in many instances in the White Paper to take up what the consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, had to say in the first place.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record some of the military's responses to the original draft. They said that it <Col N="649" /> was a seriously flawed document in both general thrust and detail, that it contained language that was minimalist and grudging, that if it entered the public domain it would seriously undermine the position of the Defence Forces within Ireland, the UN, the European Union, the Western European Union and NATO and would seriously damage morale. They also said that the draft ignored the detailed advice submitted by the Defence Forces, that the case for national defence was not adequately covered and that the assessment would leave the State in a much weaker position were there to be a resurgence of on-island violence. They also said that the issues arising from the Treaty of Amsterdam were not covered. It is an indictment of a White Paper after what was supposed to be an effective consultation period carried out over a long period. I could go on.</P>
    <P>The revisions must be welcomed but they have been hard won and do not go far enough. Although we do not yet have this in a draft, they apparently include military control over some recruitment and further reinvestment which must be welcomed. I welcome the 100% investment announced by the Minister and I also welcome the fact that the Department of Finance will not claw back more money. However, the accountancy approach the Minister took to the Defence Forces showed an appalling lack of understanding by him of its needs.</P>
    <P>There has been an abuse in this saga of the deafness compensation issue. Future defence policy should not be dependent on the way this issue is managed. Failure to establish an effective compensation tribunal is part of the problem we face today. The military consequences of the proposed cutbacks and the change in tasking which this would mean have not been spelled out in the White Paper. There is a failure to spell out the implications of the cutbacks in terms of military tasks or changed tasks for the Defence Forces. It is clear that, if we are to train people to become involved in international peacekeeping in the numbers required, given our commitments at European level and our decision to become involved in Partnership for Peace and in training exercises with the defence forces of other countries, and if the tasks remain as they are, the Defence Forces will find it extremely difficult to do the type of training those commitments demand. The White Paper deals inadequately with the implications of our international obligations.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the international defence environment is changing and that the military must be accountable to a democratic Government and must modernise and change its tasks in line with the changing environment. The White Paper was an opportunity to create the potential for the Defence Forces to grasp this initiative. Unfortunately, as my colleague, Deputy Wall, said, it has been mishandled and has left a sour taste and a mountain to climb for the future. The forces, their members and families, charged with the security of the State, aides to the civil power <Col N="650" /> and international peacekeeping obligations have had to fight for their voice to be heard at a time when partnership is espoused by all. That is a contradiction. At a time of economic prosperity, decisions about key investment highlighted by the PricewaterhouseCoopers reviews &ndash; the review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service was delivered over two years ago &ndash; have been grudgingly delivered only in part.</P>
    <P>There has been a lack of vision of the future role of the Defence Forces, the role we want our Army to play in future and how that role is to be translated into day-to-day management of the forces best suited to our needs. There is a contrast between the Department of Foreign Affairs, which continuously updates the expanding role of the Defence Forces in fulfilling our international commitments, and the plans formulated for the Defence Forces. Only by those two Departments working together can we achieve harmony and coherence in implementing Government policy and in particular our important international commitments. What we have is a piecemeal approach decided almost on a day-by-day basis.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces play a key role in the protection of citizens and their assets &ndash; I will examine a few examples. The Naval Service plays a key support role in the protection of our fishery waters, which include 20% of European Union waters, and in emergency sea rescue missions. It is also crucial in patrolling our territorial waters and protecting them against organised crime groups, as evidenced by regular seizures. I argued last year in a policy paper on the Naval Service that it is underfunded and underequipped for the job we expect it to do. It is impossible for it to undertake major drug patrols, search and rescue, pollution control and fishery protection on the resources it is given. We still have a naval capacity that is almost 20 times less than the European norm. The average European naval fleet is obviously much larger, yet the area our Naval Service covers is enormous. As a result, we have the least policed coastline in the developed world. Narcotic smugglers have said on record that the reason they ply their trade on our coastline is that it is so poorly policed.</P>
    <P>There are major issues concerning the Naval Service. For example, the White Paper has nothing to offer on the new problem of the illegal trafficking of immigrants. While the Cabinet today discussed proposals for a new quota of immigrants, we are not in a position to prevent illegal immigration on our shores and the Naval Service does not have the resources to deal with this. This is an issue which must be urgently addressed by the Minister for Defence in conjunction with the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs. Our Naval Service should also be capable of monitoring environmental concerns off our coastline in accordance with the task of enforcing international law, but again we are lacking in ability. The White Paper does not find a sufficient case for a significant shift in defence provision towards <Col N="651" /> an enhanced naval contribution. The way it is dealt with in the White Paper is inadequate, the density of naval vessels is unsatisfactory and the vision for it is not spelled out.</P>
    <P>Among the key issues regarding the Air Corps is when the ageing fleet will be re-equipped. Questions have been asked about whether the Air Corps would continue its search and rescue service and these questions need answers. During 1999, the Air Corps completed over 1,100 missions, 91 search and rescue missions, 128 air ambulance operations, 220 fishery protection missions and other services. It is clear there is an urgent need to purchase aircraft for the Air Corps. I welcome the decision the Minister has made in principle in that regard, but it is again being delayed and referred to another strategic management committee for detailed decisions in this area.</P>
    <P>In terms of defence spending, our figure is low by European standards. Last year, for example, we spent 0.8% of our GDP on defence compared to that spent by Holland at 1.8% and Greece at 4.8%. The figure of 0.8% is further reduced when one looks at the expenditure in non-military areas, compensations for members of the Defence Forces, the Red Cross, the Garda Air Support Wing, the equitation school and various other issues. We have had a Defence Forces which required investment and has not received it to date.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Walsh said, in recent years there has been a huge reorganisation of the Defence Forces. Much of the discussion in recent weeks and months has not recognised the enormous changes that have already taken place and the enormous cutbacks that have already been made. Parts of the White Paper are already out of date due to the lateness of its publication. In the draft I saw just before today's launch, section 2 which really dealt with the implications of the Good Friday Agreement is already out of date given the suspension of the Executive. The possible return of violent incidents was highlighted as recently as last week with another attack on the British Army sleeping quarters at Ballykelly in County Derry.</P>
    <P>The Army has provided a vital back-up service for the Garda Síochána for many years in a wide range of areas including prisoner and cash escorts. It is highly unusual for a country to have its army engaged in so many diverse duties on a daily basis. Yet again, the White Paper provides for the continued provision by the Defence Forces of aid to the civil power, it would appear at the same level but with less personnel. I would like the Minister to address the question of the change in tasks which less personnel will imply. That has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>At a European level I have already addressed the issue of the increasing role which our Defence Forces will be expected to play. We are expected to provide further military supports in respect of the Euro-Atlantic Council and the Petersberg <Col N="652" /> Tasks. Following the recent European Council meeting in Helsinki, the Defence Forces will also be expected to make a real contribution to a European led rapid reaction force consisting of 15 brigades and 60,000 personnel within 60 days of the call for deployment. This is a serious and challenging task for which our Defence Forces must be able to make adequate preparation through the provision of proper training and resources. It is clear that surveys have shown that the Irish people support participation in the type of international peacekeeping in which our Defence Forces have been involved and for which there is clearly a huge need in the world today. If anything, there is an increasing need with the number of inter-state conflicts apparent around the world. The role of international peacekeeping will become even more significant and essential in the years ahead. We are very well placed with a Defence Force so experienced in this area, to make a very strong contribution in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>To prepare for the challenges of the new millennium, the Defence Forces have in recent years undergone a huge radical overhaul. This has involved a reduction in the number of personnel by up to 40%, a massive cut by any standards. The number of units has been decreased by 30%. The Minister and his Department had the benefit of numerous reports, including a very comprehensive PriceWaterhouse report. The Chief of Staff and senior personnel have made it abundantly clear that the retention of the current organisation, including three brigades, is the minimum necessary for the force to fulfil its commitments in the future. As a result of the recent rush to negotiations, we now have a commitment to 10,500 with the Chief of Staff having the right to recruit an additional 250 people. We have uncertainty about the Council of Defence. It is in the document agreed with the Chief of Staff but what exactly its role will be is unclear.</P>
    <P>A large number of questions arise following today's press conference which I hope the Minister will address in his speech tonight.</P>

      <P>It is extremely important that the Minister clarifies the confusion which has arisen once again.

      <P>I think it is the Minister who is not used to White Papers. He has certainly mismanaged this one. He had a golden opportunity and turned it into a disaster for the Defence Forces. There was another crisis today when he could not clarify the status of his agreement with the Chief of Staff. Perhaps he will clarify the matter tonight. When the confusion over policy has been sorted, I hope the Army, the Navy and Air Corps will be able to proceed to freely fulfil their roles without the hindrance of a confused and ambiguous approach by Minister. The Defence Forces need clarity at this stage.</P>

      <P>Our PfP and Petersberg Tasks obligations ought to have been at the core of the recent controversy over this White Paper because new military equipment is of necessity &ndash; if we are to perform military tasks for NATO, through Partnership for Peace, and the EU &ndash; something not required in our traditional peacekeeping role for the UN where our equipment was actually provided. Personnel has to be cut and weaponry expenditure has to be increased. That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the lack of consultation or of its being disregarded. One wonders if the Minister has been listening to his colleagues in the EU where they have been agreeing to the EU's militarisation, in particular to the decisions taken last December in Helsinki. The Taoiseach has agreed to the development within three years of a rapid reaction force of 50,000 to 60,000 troops capable of being deployed within 60 days. <Col N="654" /> Taking rotation into account this is a commitment of more than 200,000 troops. What numbers and what money will Ireland be able to commit to this force? What consultation has the Minister had with the European Commission President, Romano Prodi who announced in Latvia earlier this month that:</P>
    <P>Any attack or aggression against an EU member nation would be an attack or aggression against the whole EU. This is the highest guarantee.</P>
    <P>Are the Defence Forces being prepared to come to the defence of the EU? What numbers and moneys will be required for this? What consultation has the Minister had with Javier Solana, the EU's high representative of common, foreign and security policy who has provided a blueprint for a near merger between the EU and NATO in a new 20 page dossier? Most importantly, what consultation has this Government had with the Irish people about the future of our Defence Forces and our neutrality?</P>
    <P>We have been promised a referendum when our neutrality technically ends, but we were promised a referendum on Partnership for Peace also and we know what happened there. We also know that 70% of Irish people still support Ireland's neutral status. When I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, when he was standing in for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, he said: &ldquo;There is a political commitment.&rdquo;  There is no constitutional requirement. This is something that has not been addressed in this White Paper. It has totally missed the opportunity to elaborate a defence policy for Ireland which best suits the security interests of this country and the security interests of the international community. We ought to concentrate on UN peacekeeping. We have a fantastic record in this regard. The document states that notwithstanding Ireland's continuing support for the UN, the scale of our commitment must be kept under review. The Government has decided that there should be a rigorous review of the sustainability of the current level of commitment in light of decisions on restructuring set out in the White Paper. The Government is saying its commitment is not with the UN but with PfP and the Petersberg Tasks. That is to the Minister's shame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann commends the Minister for Defence for the completion of the first White Paper on Defence, which sets out a strategy to the year 2010 to modernise and develop the Defence Forces to ensure that they are capable of fulfilling the roles laid down by Government and to maintain an effective civil defence capability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier today I published the first White Paper on <Col N="655" /> Defence. Since the foundation of the State the Defence Forces have been an important arm of the State and an expression of our independence and our sovereignty as a nation. I have worked tirelessly as Minister for Defence to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces it needs. Sometimes this has required unpopular decisions and I have not been afraid to make these.</P>
    <P>The motion is a distortion of both the White Paper and all it contains. It is a tired and totally unconvincing attempt to attack a soundly based approach to defence because those in Opposition do not have the inclination, the imagination or the courage to see what needs to be done and to see it done. Later I will detail exactly how the White Paper will give this country the Defence Forces it needs. Before that, I want those who proposed this motion to ask themselves what possible use is it to put forward a text as ridiculous as it is garbled and inaccurate. This House has valuable work to do and all fair-minded people will resent its time being taken up with such a hollow and ill-conceived motion. The members of the Opposition would do well to remember that the people can see cant and hypocrisy from a long way off. That is what they are witnessing in this motion. It is hard to credit that anyone could advance, let alone try to stand over, such a blatant misrepresentation of the position.</P>
    <P>I launched the White Paper on Defence this afternoon. I hope that on reading it those who have put their names to this motion will find time to rethink. This Government committed itself in the Action Programme for the Millennium to the publication of a White Paper on Defence. Unlike other parties, this Government has delivered on its commitments. Being the first White Paper, I felt it was important, as did my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, to give the White Paper the time it deserved and required. The production of any White Paper, but especially the first of its kind, was a significant undertaking and it is to the credit of my Department that it was achieved within the time I asked.</P>
    <P>An important element of the White Paper process was the consultative element. I want to cover this point in detail as it is clear that no matter how many times I have outlined the correct position, there remains a deficit of understanding. From the start it was recognised that all those who were interested in the White Paper should have the opportunity to make their input. This opportunity was advertised and 46 written submissions were received. Some of these were significant and all were of value to the process. For all the talk of being interested in defence and the Defence Forces, those on the Opposition benches did not bother to make a submission. It is easy to put one's name to an ill-thought out motion. The Department received a submission from the Green Party but that party did not avail of the opportunity to make an oral presentation to elaborate on its submission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> It takes time and commitment to put submissions together. In order to facilitate the Defence Forces representative associations, I accepted their submissions long after the deadline.</P>

Meetings were arranged involving civil and military managers of my Department with those who accepted invitations to make an oral presentation. This gave a further opportunity for those interested in making an input to do so and for this input to be directed to both the civil and military elements of my Department.</P>

      <P>I now turn to the other aspects of consultation. Despite the claims made in the media, the civil and military elements of the Department of Defence work extremely closely together on all aspects of defence. Day in and day out civil and military managers are working to ensure that the people have the defence services and capabilities the State requires. This work covers the broadest range of duties of any Department. Aside from policy issues, the Department's programmes cover general defence and security, aid to the civil power, overseas peace support and humanitarian tasks across the globe, fishery protection, ministerial air transport, property management of 21,000 acres and 28 barracks, civil defence with 6,000 members in training and the eighth largest departmental budget.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the Defence Forces were excluded from the White Paper process is without any foundation. The Department of Defence is unique in having civil and military branches. Therefore, it is totally erroneous and uninformed to talk about the Department and the military as though the military is external to the Department. The civil and military elements combined make up the Department and neither can operate in isolation. There is daily contact and extremely positive working and cordial and friendly relationships at all levels of the Department. The day to day work of defence would not be carried out so successfully were it otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper, like every other aspect of departmental business, has been the subject of regular discussion in the Department. This has taken place at civil, military and top management level. Therefore, let me scotch for once and for all the notion that such contact and consultation did not take place. However, it is no secret that views came forward from within the Defence Forces which suggested that there was not consultation. This was further whipped up by irresponsible people who do not see the dangers in a <Col N="657" /> democracy of trying to force a divide between a Minister and any group of public servants. It is regrettable that such a short-sighted approach was adopted by some which I assure people will be long remembered.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of Ministers on behalf of the Government to make decisions and to determine policy. This is what I have done and what I will always do as an elected Member of this House and a servant of the people. Those who forget that they are no more than servants find out sooner or later that acting in their own self-interest brings them or anyone else no good.</P>
    <P>It is up to Ministers to make decisions and policy in the best interests of the people. This can sometimes bring the odd brickbat but those familiar with my sporting past know I am well able for brickbats, hurleys and a lot more. It is often unpopular to make the right decision. Last year I announced the closure of six barracks which were surplus to military requirements. Everyone knew this had to be done but those on the Opposition benches did not have the conviction to do it when they were in power and did not have the courage to support the right decision when it was made. I pity those who live like that because it is not living, but existing. That is not my way and it never will be.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the detail of the White Paper. The sole object of the White Paper is to provide flexible, well-equipped Defence Forces which are capable of fulfilling the roles laid down by Government. The original objectives of the White Paper were to provide a medium term policy framework within which the defence policy can evolve and to set out a clear strategy for the next ten years; to provide for the continuation of the reform programme of the defence services, already commenced under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, consistent with the national and international security environment and the state of the public finances; to ensure that the management of the defence services is in accordance with the evolution of the strategic management initiative for the public service; and to set out the basis for the future development of civil defence policy and the follow-up to the present &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo; strategy.</P>
    <P>Without question the White Paper achieved these objectives. There is an important implementation task ahead but the road is clear and while there may be the odd bump, it is the right road. No doubt those on the Opposition benches will try to distract us from getting to the destination but we will get there. That is what bothers them most of all. The length and lack of focus to their motion is sufficient testimony to their lack of clear thinking and conviction.</P>
    <P>No Minister coming into this House expects plaudits from the Opposition but he occasionally hopes for a constructive suggestion or two. However, this Opposition or the Deputies who have spoken have not delayed us with any constructive suggestions. All we have heard are the same tired old admonishments. They know there <Col N="658" /> is no substance to what they are saying. However, if they keep saying it, they will stay on the Opposition benches and I might stay in Government. There is no absence of thought or action on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out a sustainable ten year programme to give us modern world-class Defence Forces. More important, the programme will involve fresh investment of at least £250 million in new equipment and infrastructure. The major points in the White Paper are as follows: the reorganised Defence Forces will be a flexible light infantry force on the lines recommended by Price Waterhouse; a commitment to a policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces, which the Opposition did not give when in power, along with the development of a new comprehensive personnel management strategy covering recruitment, promotion, etc.; the allocation of 100% of an estimated £25 million annual savings arising from Defence Forces restructuring and the allocation of 100% of the proceeds from the sale of all property surplus to military requirements to equipment and infrastructure; the reduction in numbers will see a revised strength of 10,500 plus the option of 250 recruits in training from a current strength of about 10,900; the development of the Air Corps with commitments to major equipment investment and the allocation of a special fund of £5 million per year for the next five years to meet urgent Air Corps equipment requirements; continued investment in the Naval Service based on an eight ship flotilla, a commitment to order a second new ship and provision for new effectiveness and efficiency measures to enhance fishery protection &ndash; what must it be like for people in the Naval Service to hear crocodile tears from individuals who, in their term of office, bought nothing for them? The introduction of two ships in the life of this Government is a record without parallel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Other points in the White Paper include a continued commitment to overseas participation in accordance with Government policy &ndash; a key element of the development programme will be to ensure that the Defence Forces are geared to meet the new challenges in the overseas <Col N="659" /> domain; the development of the Reserve Defence Force involving a new organisational structure and a commitment to improved training and equipment &ndash; I will give them back the two weeks training that the Opposition graciously took away from them; more detailed proposals will be drawn up and submitted to the Government following a consultative process; the establishment of a new statutory authority to manage the Curragh; decentralisation of the Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence, involving 30 staff, to Roscrea.</P>
      <P>I will speak on some of these principal features and some of the background issues contained in the White Paper. An important foundation element of the White Paper was an assessment of the defence and security environment involving the principal stakeholders. Based on these inputs the principal conclusions of the Government's current review of this environment are that Ireland faces a generally benign security environment; the external security environment does not contain specific threats to the overall security of the State; broader security challenges have emerged in the European context which impact on Ireland as a member of the European Union, including humanitarian and other crises for which international responses are required; the on-island security environment is being transformed through progress under the Good Friday Agreement. While some threats to peace remain, the Agreement provides the basis for a lasting peace.</P>
      <P>We must, therefore, balance the natural desire for optimism concerning the environment we face with due prudence in retaining the capabilities and flexibility to respond to changes in the environment and new challenges that may emerge. The White Paper does this. By modernising the Defence Forces and ensuring that they are world class, we will as a country have the flexibility to meet the opportunities and challenges of the future.</P>
      <P>It is important that the statement of roles of the Defence Forces is kept up to date and the White Paper provided the opportunity to refine the statement concerning the passage of time. First, the revised statement reflects the need for the Government's assessment to cover the broader security and defence context, including threats, which impact on overall defence planning and configuration. Second, the revised statement recognises the role of the Defence Forces in participating in overseas missions and takes account of the wider context in which UN authorised missions may arise.</P>
      <P>Any White Paper must dedicate a significant element to the organisation and strategies needed to implement policy. The White Paper sets out the strategy to modernise our Defence Forces in an affordable and sustainable way and sets out development proposals for the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Force has undergone <Col N="660" /> significant changes in the past few years. Like other elements of the public service, it is recognised that the modernisation process cannot be achieved overnight. This process involves getting the organisation right and maximising the utilisation of resources. We have known for some time that there was a serious imbalance between the ratio of pay to non-pay expenditure. We also recognised a need to better utilise the overall allocation of resources to defence. Adjusting this imbalance is an important element of the White Paper strategy. This will ensure that for the future defence provision will be affordable and, just as importantly, achieved on the basis of a balanced and sustainable approach.</P>
    <P>The necessary reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force will be based on the reduction of overall strength from 11,500 to 10,500 plus the option of 250 recruits in training. Over the past few years, I paid much attention to recruitment and I have introduced a process of continuous recruitment. Earlier I announced that 750 recruits will be targeted this year. Despite the Opposition's search for negative angles, the White Paper will continue the good work of development. The White Paper naturally recognises the importance of individual soldiers, airmen and seamen to the Permanent Defence Force and the White Paper sets down an agenda of items which will be comprehended in an updated personnel management plan. This plan will cover all aspects of ensuring that a career in the Defence Forces is attractive and rewarding and that the development of personnel policies are in tune with the needs of the organisation.</P>
    <P>The role of the representative associations in this context is fully acknowledged. Many of the personnel issues raised in the White Paper are the subject of existing agreements negotiated with the associations under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. In addition, there are other personnel management issues where the associations have indicated a desire to advance the interests of their members. Both sets of proposals for change will be addressed under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also contains specific proposals for the development of the Air Corps and Naval Service. Both services have been the subject of special study. Based on these special studies and the policy parameters set out in the White Paper, we have the basis of viable development strategies for the Air Corps and the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Significant new investment will be made in the Air Corps. An immediate injection of funds of £5 million per annum will be available for the next five years and funds will also be available from the other savings. These funds will initiate the vital investment in new aircraft, rotary or fixed wing. The Naval Service has very recently commissioned a state of the art offshore patrol vessel, the LE<i> Róisín</i>, and the White Paper confirms the Government's intention to take up the option on a second similar vessel. This will ensure the main<Col N="661" /> tenance of an eight vessel flotilla for the Naval Service as part of the overall White Paper modernisation strategy.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also concerns the development of other areas of defence, notably the Reserve Defence Force. The broad policy framework set out in the White Paper for the Reserve Defence Force is based on the work of a special study which was completed following a very extensive process of consultation and consideration of all the issues. Full implementation will, however, involve quite significant change in the reserve and will be based on the necessary consultative process.</P>
    <P>A feature of the existing FCA organisation is that it has a countrywide geographical spread. This feature will in general be retained. The full organisational and strength details of the new entities will be determined in the implementation process. This process will involve a careful examination of strength numbers and the extent of the spread regarding effectiveness, efficiency, local factors and demographics. An Slua Muirí will be developed to improve the capacity of members to provide a genuine naval reserve capability.</P>
    <P>A key element of the new Reserve Defence Force will be new and enhanced training. An important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that RDF personnel should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to appropriate qualifications, availability and advance training. This initiative will be important to ensure the retention of a highly motivated and trained reserve which is in the best interests of the State and the Defence Forces as a whole. This significant change will be preceded by appropriate consultation with the representative associations. No member of the Opposition so far has mentioned the reserve and the importance of the developments of the reserve, notwithstanding its 14,000 members countrywide.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Opposition has tried to suggest, overseas peace support operations were carefully considered, which will be clear to those who read the White Paper. First, as the White Paper states, it is in Ireland's interest to ensure that the conduct of international relations is undertaken in accordance with international law and democratic principles. This is supported and reinforced in a direct way by Ireland's willingness to provide peacekeepers to the troubled spots of the world.</P>
    <P>Overseas service is of course popular among military personnel and has offered the Defence Forces a range of important training and operational opportunities not available at home. It also provides a powerful motivation to enhance operational and training standards. Individual officers have held important appointments in a number of UN missions giving Ireland a significant influence in the conduct of a number of critical peace support missions down the years. In all cases, officers and other ranks have brought their expertise, professionalism and dedication to bear <Col N="662" /> to their own credit and to the honour of the country.</P>
    <P>There is another side to our peace support operations, namely, the personal sacrifice which our soldiers have made during the past 42 years. We were reminded of this in the most tragic way in recent weeks when four fine young soldiers lost their lives in a traffic accident in Lebanon. Overall 80 soldiers have died serving their country in the cause of international peace on overseas service. We owe it to them and to those serving today to ensure that the Defence Forces are modernised to meet the changing defence and security environment. This is what the White Paper does.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out the defence policy direction in relation to overseas peace support operations. Policy will be determined in the light of the following factors: security requirements at home; the ongoing development of UN peace support operations; the evolution of security structures and developments within the emerging security architecture in Europe and the necessity to have defence resources available and capable of meeting the needs of Government; and the need for overseas peace support operations to be balanced and proportionate with respect to the defence budget, resources and other commitments. All these factors will be kept under careful review and our approaches to peace support operations adapted accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces will, subject to domestic security requirements, continue to contribute to peace support activities overseas and the White Paper sets out the policy approach in considering individual requests to participate in peacekeeping missions.</P>
    <P>As part of the ongoing equipment procurement policy, the Defence Forces will be equipped to meet their overseas role. Recent equipment and <i>matériel</i> programmes will ensure that the Defence Forces have the capacity to undertake overseas activities in the new operational environment. These include the APC programme, the acquisition of specialist logistical vehicles and the continued upgrading of the transport fleet.</P>
    <P>The House already debated the decision to join Partnership for Peace, therefore, I do not propose to cover that matter at length again tonight. However, I will make the general point that considerable benefits will accrue to the Defence Forces from participation in PfP, allowing them to enhance their capability for multi-national peacekeeping operations in the future through the medium of inter-operability development, training and exercises.</P>
    <P>PfP will be of value to Ireland in co-operation and planning for Petersberg Tasks. Ireland's participation in NATO led UN mandated forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Kosovo are examples of the type of situations in which Ireland can benefit from participation in PfP, because much of the preparation and training for these new style missions is undertaken by countries under the auspices of PfP. The Defence Forces, in turn, <Col N="663" /> have much to offer to other participating states in terms of the cumulative experience and insight which they have gained over many years in a wide variety of peacekeeping missions. This will give Ireland an influence in how peacekeeping operations will be conducted in the future.</P>
    <P>The emerging scenario must be set in the context of Ireland's membership of the UN and does not take from Ireland's belief in the primacy of the United Nations as the principal institution in the development of international relations and the promotion of peace and security. The Treaty of Amsterdam takes account both of the specific character of the security and defence polices of member states and the broader European and global security context.</P>
    <P>The common foreign and security policy under the Treaty of Amsterdam encompasses a new role for the EU in the areas of humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, known as Petersberg Tasks. In Ireland's case, participation in Petersberg Tasks will not affect our long standing policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the development of European military forces which would be available to the EU to undertake Petersberg operations are indicative of the recognition of both the indivisibility of European security and the need for a collective response by Europeans to these challenges. EU member states have set an agreed, voluntary target, known as a Headline Goal, to improve capabilities for Petersberg Tasks which they aim to meet by the year 2003. Ireland will maintain the sovereign decision over whether, when and how to commit Irish personnel to a Petersberg Task or to any overseas peacekeeping or crisis management operation.</P>
    <P>The EU has identified the capabilities to ensure effective performance in peace support and crisis management. These include deployability sustainability, inter-operability, flexibility, mobility, survivability and command and control. The qualitative importance of these capabilities is borne out by Ireland's experience of peacekeeping and crisis management over many years. The White Paper contains policies aimed at ensuring that the Defence Forces are geared to meeting these challenges.</P>
    <P>The decisions at the 1999 Cologne and Helsinki EU Summits recognise the need for a collective response to security challenges and the associated need for the EU to work towards a capability for autonomous action. This does not involve the creation of a European army. The participation by the Defence Forces in this emerging environment is an important element of Ireland's capacity to influence events in a way which is sensitive to this country's needs and consonant with its military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate that all of the developments I have described for the Defence Force are on the basis that Ireland will remain an active and com<Col N="664" /> mitted participant in international peace support operations and the roles of the Defence Forces expressly recognise this.</P>
    <P>Another important part of the Department of Defence is the area of Civil Defence, involving approximately 6,000 volunteer members who are trained in various skills such as first aid, rescue, fire fighting, emergency feeding, evacuee care, land and water search and radiation monitoring. In the period 2000-10, the Civil Defence will continue to focus its efforts on enhancing its capacity to respond to emergencies as a high quality second line service in addition to facilitating community support activities.</P>
    <P>The Government has further decided that, in line with its policy on decentralisation of public services, the Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence will be decentralised to Roscrea as soon as practical arrangements can be put in place. The process of strategic change will also be continued in the Civil Service and civilian employee elements of the Department of Defence and the White Paper outlines key issues facing the civil side of the Department.</P>
    <P>Overall, therefore the White Paper succeeds in what it set out to do &ndash; to provide a comprehensive, affordable, sustainable and progressive strategy for defence and the Defence Forces for the next decade.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the discussions I had with the Chief of Staff have been included in the White Paper. The White Paper awaits final completion but, as people with experience in this area will know, this is merely a technical matter. Any changes that can be incorporated in the White Paper will be included in the final draft. It is important to realise that the main contents of my discussions with the Chief of Staff are already incorporated in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Members on this side of the House are proud that, despite a number of setbacks, we have been able to produce a blueprint which will provide ten years stability in the Defence Forces for the first time in the history of the State. There will be ten years of constant recruitment and a ten year process of continuous investment in new equipment, both of which previous Governments failed to recognise the need for and failed to achieve.</P>
    <P>As far as Deputy Fitzgerald's reference to hearing impairment claims is concerned, the Attorney General to the then Rainbow Government advised it that there was a desperate need for action in this area before it went out of control and decimated the Defence Forces. The Rainbow Government failed to take that advice and, as a result, I inherited a truck which was careering down the road with no brakes. We applied the brakes and we saved&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister often refers to a juggernaut careering down a hill without a driver and without any brakes. That is an apt way to describe the role he has played in the Department of Defence since he assumed office. The sooner he comes to a halt the better because he is certainly doing a lot of damage as he goes on his merry way.</P>
      <P>I was surprised by the tone and content of the Minister's contribution. The Opposition did not put him in this position and it is our responsibility to highlight the many shortcomings he has presided over. While I appreciate that few people like criticism, he appears to be extremely sensitive on the matter. I hasten to add we are here to help and help is definitely needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister's thinly veiled threat that views coming forward from within the Defence Forces &ldquo;will be long remembered&rdquo; is particularly unhelpful. I hope it was the work of an over enthusiastic civil servant and that his party colleagues will withdraw the remark at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>While some organisations or institutions may fear the concept of a White Paper, there is generally a welcome for such a development as it is regarded as a means of putting one's views on the record and making recommendations which will ultimately benefit all if implemented in a correct and proper manner. The announcement that there would be a White Paper on Defence received a broad welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, our Defence Forces have remained very much in the background, as should be the case, and only come centre stage with respect to our overseas involvement and the images of soldiers departing abroad on duty or the sad funerals that have resulted from such commitments. Many families around the country have suffered in silence and struggled to get on with their lives, long after the outcry of public sympathy and the beat of the drum have <Col N="666" /> faded into the distant past. Members of the forces never involve themselves in political matters and never openly question their role. While it may now be merely symbolic, all messes contain the proviso within their rules that there should be no discussion of women or politics. While the former, due to the lifting of the embargo on women, may no longer hold true, the latter certainly still applies &ndash; although that may have changed under the stewardship of the Minister because he is certainly a hot topic of conversation.</P>
    <P>Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, many pillars of our society faced unprecedented scrutiny, including the Defence Forces. Dissatisfaction reached a high, culminating in wives and families taking to the streets, in 1989. Subsequently, the Gleeson commission was established to examine pay and conditions. Following this, we had the Price Waterhouse review of the Defence Forces in 1994. In conjunction with these, the efficiency audit group, which was set up by the Government in 1988 under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, carried out two reports. In 1991, EAG 1 dealt with the administrative areas of the Department of Defence, and in 1992 EAG 2 reported on administrative systems in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The efficiency audit group accepted the analysis by the Price Waterhouse team and identified a key issue emerging from the consultants' report as the age profile being too high. The rainbow Government sought to address this through recruitment and a severance scheme. The Government has adopted a policy of stealthy non-recruitment in order to bring the figures down. No amount of flowery language from the Minister can disguise this fact. A simple mathematical analysis is all one needs to reach this logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>The report also identified that there was an inappropriate top management structure. The main recommendation of the Price Waterhouse report was that the Chief of Staff should be given the role of chief executive of the Defence Forces. This has not happened. During debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1998, the Minister mentioned that the previous Government had looked at the position of the Chief of Staff and that it had wished him to be empowered to act as chief executive. This was the correct approach but the Minister missed the opportunity on that occasion. If he had not done so, it is quite possible that the unseemly saga of the last month, which served no one, could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>The report also identified that operational effectiveness was impaired by organisational shortcomings. Steps have been taken to address this. Agreement was reached with the last Government that the reorganisation would take place in the context of an overall strength of 11,500. As the Defence Forces sought to get on with the reorganisation and implement measures to address the difficulties, it became clouded in what is commonly referred as the Army deafness controversy. Morale reached an all-time low. The <Col N="667" /> military debate entered the public arena and many questioned the role and function of the Army. In the middle of this, the then Minister for Defence gave the green light to the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Now, after much procrastination, we have the document. What should have been a welcome publication, is an anti-climax due to too much leaking and a failure by the Minister to approach the many views with an open mind. The Minister adopted an entrenched position. The submissions by the Defence Studies Group, RACO and PDFORRA went largely ignored, as he indulged himself in a cost cutting exercise orchestrated by the Department of Finance and aided by his Department.</P>
    <P>During the past few weeks it has been firmly established that there was a serious breakdown in relations between the Minister and senior military members. This was an unprecedented development. The most expert personnel were excluded from the process, as the Minister found the following comments hard to digest:</P>
    <P>The treatment of military advice within the White Paper undermined the civil/military relationship within the Department. It does not provide a suitable basis for a viable defence policy. The White Paper is being used as a vehicle to secure further reductions in both organisation and manpower, motivated not by national and European defence interests, but by simplistic budgetary requirements. The suggestion that the Council of Defence should be abolished cannot be accepted by the military authorities and is dismissive of the Price Waterhouse advice in this area.</P>
    <P>These comments were contained in the Defence Forces' response to the second draft of the White Paper in late January.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have sought to address the very serious issues raised but he chose to simply close the door. What should have been a source of reconciliation and discussion became a focus of suspicion and doubt. His dismissiveness created a crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Government colleagues have taken a back seat in good old Pontius Pilate fashion. On one hand, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are increasing our commitments to overseas support, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Partnership for Peace and the recent Helsinki Summit, while across the table the Minister for Defence is cutting back, in what he honestly views as a populist measure. However, I assure him it is not and at some stage this will have to be revisited.</P>
    <P>At present, we are finding it difficult to meet our UN requirements, particularly in Lebanon.</P>

      <P>With the present numbers, our overseas operation will have to be radically changed if we are to meet our peace support com<Col N="668" /> mitments. Simply listing off our current contributions around the globe vaguely disguises the fact that, in virtually all cases, we are merely making a minimal gesture.</P>
      <P>The impasse that arose due to the breakdown in relations led the Minister to meet with the Chief of Staff last Thursday. It appeared that an agreement was reached. Today, we have the White Paper. It appears, from an initial examination, that it fails to reflect some aspects of this agreement. The Minister stated last week that the Chief of Staff would have responsibility for the purchase of equipment, yet the White Paper, at paragraph 4.9.5, with respect to equipment, talks about the establishment of a high level civil/military planning and procurement group chaired at Assistant Secretary level. Surely, in the light of the agreement with the Chief of Staff, this is no longer necessary and should be changed. It was agreed that the Council of Defence will remain, which is also contained in the White Paper. If this body had been used over the past few months, much difficulty could have been averted.</P>
      <P>I am given to believe that during the press launch this afternoon the Minister spoke of chairing the strategic management committee and meeting every three months. He was vague on the issue of the Council of Defence and I see nothing reassuring in his speech. The White Paper is also vague in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister agreed and signed with the Chief of Staff certain measures that were going to be implemented in full. Has he the agreement of Cabinet for these measures? He failed to address this in his speech and in the White Paper. I hope some of his colleagues can address it.</P>
      <P>I have difficulty in referring to this as the White Paper because I do not know if it is the provisional White Paper. Will it be similar to the budget, with a White Paper mark one, mark two and mark three? This motion, despite what the Minister proclaimed, is very welcome and timely. It obviously hurts and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the Naval Service, in particular. As the Minister knows, the only naval base in the country, Haulbowline, is in my constituency and employs over 1,000 personnel. Like many of those personnel, I waited with anticipation for the emergence of the first ever White Paper on Defence. It was believed that this document would provide a much needed assessment and policy direction for the Naval Service, with a defined role and targets to aim for. I had hoped to be able to support this White Paper. However, having looked at its content and the way it has been formulated, I cannot. Apart from the fiasco of the delay in its publication, it is the content that is most worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This White Paper, as a policy document, shows either indifference to, or ignorance of, Ireland's national and international maritime obligations as <Col N="669" /> a sovereign island state within the EU. From a Naval Service point of view, the White Paper should have been, but failed to be, a serious study of maritime policing and defence requirements in Irish waters. Ireland claims sovereignty over 265,000 square miles of sea, 16% of EU waters. With that claim comes a responsibility which the White Paper has largely ignored.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that, as part of the process of formulating this document, the Government spent resources on the Price Waterhouse study on ways of improving the Naval Service. Although they had reservations at the time about some of the Price Waterhouse recommendations, senior Naval Service personnel by and large accepted the final report, as long as all its recommendations were implemented. However, the White Paper considers only some of those recommendations. For example, the Naval Service headquarters has been moved to Haulbowline. However, the Price Waterhouse report suggested such a move as the final recommendation to be implemented which was to be contingent on the other recommendations being put in place.</P>
    <P>As regards staffing, the Minister gives the misleading impression that he is adopting the Price Waterhouse recommendations. He talks of overall manpower levels of 1,144 as recommended for the Naval Service when it had seven ships. I am glad that the service now has eight ships but the Price Waterhouse recommendation was that the acquisition of an eighth ship should be accompanied by the recruitment of a crew and a half.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment to the Naval College in Ringaskiddy, the initiative for commissioning from the ranks and the desire for a planned approach to the rotation of sea and land-based personnel. However, as regards recruitment, despite the commissioning from the ranks scheme, we are failing to attract enough people to the Naval Service and this problem is not addressed in any detail in the White Paper. The Minister said that the Naval Service recruited 130 new recruits last year but did not state that it lost 140 personnel in the past 12 months. This is hardly progress, particularly when one considers that 18 of the 140 personnel who left were officers.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the important issue of our policing responsibilities as regards our national waters. The White Paper deals to some extent with our fisheries responsibilities but does not deal with drug trafficking, environmental policing or immigration policing which will become a more serious problem in the next four or five years. For this reason I cannot support the White Paper but I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this motion. The Minister for Defence is on the defensive and I support the comments made by Deputy Timmins. I regret the language used by the Minister when he said, &ldquo;It is regrettable that such a short-sighted approach was adopted by <Col N="670" /> some which I assure people will be long remembered&rdquo;. There was no need to include this sentence in the speech as it is nothing short of a veiled threat to members of the Defence Forces. It is an appalling statement and I ask the Minister to withdraw it in the interests of good relations with members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I am proud of the 23 years I spent serving in the FCÁ. I served with people who are loyal to the State and who have a long tradition of service. I interacted with members of the Permanent Defence Force who were dedicated, hard-working and loyal. I also worked with members of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and all branches of the Defence Forces, in which the people are dedicated and proud of their history and what they do.</P>
      <P>However, I am sad to say that morale is at an all time low in the Defence Forces because they have been left without leadership, knowledge or guidance as to their future. This situation arises at a time when we should be expanding our Defence Forces because of foreign commitments. In the past a foreign stimulus led to an expansion but the Minister has decided to reduce the strength of the Defence Forces and the fear is that the strength will be further reduced.</P>
      <P>At Question Time I asked the Minister what constituted morale but he did not know. He could not answer me because he has no comprehension of what constitutes morale. He has destroyed morale in the Defence Forces by his behaviour. The Chief of Staff was on the verge of resignation. This was an unprecedented and appalling situation brought about by the Minister's actions and inaction. I appeal to the Taoiseach to intervene immediately in this issue before it is too late, but I fear it may be too late already.</P>

A fortnight ago Members were lobbied by PDFORRA which was concerned about the future direction of the Defence Forces. We were led to believe that the Chief of Staff was also concerned. The Minister met the Chief of Staff last week but it is a pity he did not hold such meetings earlier in this process. If one does not talk to the chief one does not talk to the Indians.

The Minister should come to the barracks and I also invite Fine Gael's capable, able and constructive defence spokesperson, Deputy Fitzgerald. The Minister will be doing a good job for himself and the Defence Forces if he keeps Connolly Barracks open, looks after the Defence Forces and keeps the flag flying in Ireland and across the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Serious carnage is taking place on the roads at present. There are also spiralling motor insurance premiums for all drivers, particularly the young. Those of us who drive regularly know there has been a significant increase in the volume of traffic on all roads. Unfortunately, there has also been a dramatic increase in the number of serious roads accidents, deaths and serious injuries. No one could argue that speed is not a major factor in these appalling accident rates. County Louth is near the top of the statistical chart for accidents and deaths on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motor insurance premiums are being driven through the roof as a result of the rise in the number of insurance claims and the attendant costs of this high accident rate. My motion asks that a co-ordinated effort be made by the motor and insurance industries to explore the possibility of fitting speed control devices fixed to cars. When drivers, particularly young drivers, are prepared to fit such a device, the motor insurance premiums should correspondingly decrease. This would be of benefit to everyone and the situation <Col N="672" /> on the roads would change dramatically if we could reduce the high speeds at which a minority of those on the road drive.</P>
    <P>I have been campaigning for lower motor insurance costs for young drivers for some time but I am realistic enough to know that if there is a high accident rate, inevitably it will be difficult to reduce premiums. It may be a question of addressing the question from another angle by reducing the number of accidents on the roads. If we can reduce the speed of cars driven by young and inexperienced drivers, it will be of great assistance in reducing the numbers being killed or seriously injured in road accidents and, by doing so, it will reduce the motor insurance premiums for all drivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Kirk is aware, the relatively high cost of insurance for young drivers is directly related to their adverse claims experience as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte and Touche Report, &ldquo;On an Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs&rdquo;, found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers is twice that of the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group are responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>After being appointed to my present position, I immediately re-established and revamped the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. This was a major initiative on my part aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations to address those costs. The board, the expanded membership of which includes a member representing young drivers' interests, has undertaken an ambitious programme of work and research, particularly in relation to the basis of charges for young drivers.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key, therefore, to reducing insurance costs for young drivers is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety education programmes for sec<Col N="673" /> ondary school students. My Government colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has been asked to look at a graduated licensing system for learner drivers based on the Ontario model, which could have a significant impact if introduced here. I recognise that there are other possible approaches and I agree that the suggestion made by Deputy Kirk is very interesting.</P>
    <P>I am constantly in communication with the insurance industry about a number of issues, including that of young drivers. I have had numerous discussions with the industry about such innovative approaches. Some of these ideas focus not only on the training and improving the safety consciousness of the individual young driver but also on the speed and safety of the car that he or she is driving. Another idea which comes forward from time to time is the acceptance of restrictions by the young driver. An example of such a restriction would be an agreement to drive within a specified time which would exclude the hours from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. when the most damaging accidents occur. The difficulty with any of these approaches, however, is demonstrating that they will have an impact on claims and risk. Without such assurances the industry is reluctant to reduce premiums.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kirk is aware, I cannot intervene directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels. EU legislation prevents Governments or insurance supervisors from exercising a role in relation to policy terms or pricing. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured has to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint.</P>
    <P>I can only assure Deputy Kirk that I am as concerned as he about the cost of insurance for young drivers and I will continue to explore innovative proposals such as his with the insurance industry. There is no escaping the reality, however, that premiums charged must be a realistic reflection of the risks involved in the cover being offered.</P>

      <P>In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance clearly signalled that the Government intends to relocate 10,000 civil servants and public servants in the semi-State sector to locations outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kilkenny is one of the most beautiful places in Ireland and is within easy reach of Dublin. It has excellent social and leisure amenities, the tourism industry has grown in recent years and any influx of civil servants and public servants would be offered an excellent quality of life. Kilkenny city, however, has not always enjoyed the benefits of economic growth. There has been a 10% increase in investment but that is substantially less than other counties in the region. There is no tech<Col N="674" /> nology industry or third level institution. The influx of 130 from the Office of Public Works and the Patents' Office since 1996 has improved the quality of life for the inhabitants of the city and has been a tremendous boost to the local economy.</P>
    <P>The recent decision of the National Roads Authority that the Dublin to Waterford route should run <i>via</i> Carlow and Kilkenny indicates that the N9 is ripe for economic and social development. Kilkenny is only 70 miles from Dublin where there is major urban congestion. If the Minister for Finance is looking for suitable locations for decentralisation, Kilkenny city would fit the bill.</P>
    <P>It would be pointless to ask that a Department be located in a city without a site. There is a 24 acre site available in Kilkenny within minutes walk of the city centre. That site forms part of the integrated area plan recently announced by the Minister for Finance. It is adjacent to the railway station, which will enjoy a commuter service within the next couple of years, and the city centre, at the top of John Street. It should be considered as part of any Government decision to relocate civil servants and Departments outside Dublin. I hope Kilkenny city will form part of the Government's plans to enrich the lives of the people who will move. Relocation would also provide a welcome boost to the local economy of the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for raising in the House the important issue of decentralisation. As the House is aware, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced in his Budget Statement the Government's intention to embark on a new and radical programme of decentralisation with the transfer of the maximum number of public sector jobs from Dublin. In pursuit of this policy, the Government intends to relocate almost entire Departments and offices and other public bodies to provincial centres. It is intended that the forthcoming programme will, for the first time, involve non-commercial State-sponsored bodies. The Minister's budget announcement endorses the commitment set out in the reviewed An Action Programme for the Millennium to a policy of balanced regional development. The programme sets as a key priority the channelling of public sector jobs into provincial areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current programme of decentralisation, which is expected to be completed in the early part of next year, will involve the relocation of more than 4,000 civil servants from Dublin to a large number of provincial locations. The impact of this programme cannot be underestimated, given that it involves almost 20 towns throughout the country. In Deputy Hogan's constituency, some 100 staff have already relocated to the Office of Public Works and the Patents Office of <Col N="675" /> the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in Kilkenny. I was pleased to have been involved with these transfers when I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Almost 50% of all civil servants are now located outside Dublin and while decentralisation cannot account for all of that it has played a major part and has contributed significantly to a greater geographical spread of Government services. All regions of the country have benefited from the Government's policy on decentralisation and it is the Government's intention that any new programme would maintain that policy. The addition of new jobs to an area, whether through decentralisation or otherwise, gives it a positive economic boost. New jobs result in increased economic growth and better use of existing, and often underused, local infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has begun a process of consultation with his colleagues in Government with a view to identifying almost complete Departments and offices and other bodies which could be included in the new programme. The Minister hopes that this element of the process will be completed in time for decisions on a significant new programme to be taken by the summer. In developing a new programme the Minister has in mind a number of objectives, including the promotion of regional development, the reduction of congestion in Dublin city, the establishment of a more even spread of public sector jobs around the country and the procurement of office accommodation at lower cost than in Dublin.</P>
    <P>However, the Government is conscious of the need to maintain the efficiency of service delivery in determining the locations of Government services and the functions which can be efficiently relocated. Sections of Departments and offices which are decentralised must be of a certain size to be viable and sufficiently self-contained to be able to function effectively outside of Dublin. It is essential also that adequate management control is maintained.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's personal commitment and that of the Government towards the principle of decentralisation, it is worth cautioning against any impression that a new wave of decentralisation to multiple provincial locations is imminent. It is vitally important that all the issues relating to decentralisation are fully considered before decisions are taken. Appropriate blocks of work have to be identified, staff have to be selected and trained and suitable accommodation must be sourced. These issues take time and it is important to bear this in mind. On the basis of previous experience it takes about two years from the date of a decision to relocate staff to their taking up position in the new building. I say this not to demonstrate any lack of enthusiasm on the <Col N="676" /> part of the Minister for Finance or the Government, but to emphasise that after decisions are taken it will be some time before staff arrive in their new locations.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to address those many public representatives who have recently been in contact with him about the subject of decentralisation and to acknowledge the very impressive cases which have been advanced for many potential locations. He is anxious to reassure those who have been making representations that these cases will be considered fully by him and the Government. In that context Deputy Hogan can be assured that the case now being made by him for the inclusion of Kilkenny in any new programme has been noted and will be fully considered in the context of the consultative process on which the Minister has embarked. If the Deputy can confirm that the site of 24 acres to which he referred is in local authority ownership, it would make it easier for the Government to make a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for being present in the House. The Department of Health and Children is failing to uphold its policy on dental health. The dental health strategy of the Department states that central services are to be provided on a basis of need and not on the ability to pay or on geographic location.</P>
      <P>This policy is being reneged on on two fronts in the Western Health Board region. First, children in the south County Roscommon area are not receiving the same level of dental service which their counterparts are receiving in other parts of the county. These children have been without any dental service for the past six months. The Department has now approved a six month pilot programme in the area, but only children in certain classes &ndash; sixth, fourth and second &ndash; will receive a service under the Department's proposals. Children in other classes will only receive an emergency service. None of the children will be provided with a service in their local health centres and they must travel to either Athlone, Ballinasloe or Roscommon to receive dental treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents of the children involved want this pilot scheme to be immediately expanded to include all school-going children, thereby ensuring that they have the same access to treatment as other children in the county. The long-term solution to this problem can only be resolved by the appointment of a full-time dentist to the health centres in the south County Roscommon area. The health board has advertised the position on numerous occasions but has been unable <Col N="677" /> to attract anyone to the post. This problem is fundamental to a community health service.</P>
    <P>A dentist, or any other health professional, receives the same remuneration and works under the same conditions as his colleagues in Dublin 4, Galway city, Cork city or the rural parts of County Roscommon. Positions in these urban centres are more attractive to young health professionals. The Western Health Board is unable to filll a number of professional positions throughout the region. If the Minister agrees with equality of treatment, what measures will he put in place to ensure that these vacancies are filled as soon as possible?</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to the inequality in the provision of orthodontic services for children in the Western Health Board region. First, the children must, on average, wait longer for treatment than children in neighbouring health board regions. The waiting list on a<i> per capita</i> basis is as bad as the worst region in the country, the Eastern Health Board region. Why should children attending the same school in Athlone be treated differently? A child in the midland region is treated twice as quickly as a child seated at the same school desk who is on the waiting list in the Western Health Board region. Is this equality?</P>
    <P>Second, the 1985 orthodontic guidelines set by the Department are being interpreted differently by various health boards. There is a lack of standardisation of the assessments procedure between the boards. As the Western Health Board has a large waiting list, the orthodontists must strictly interpret the guidelines while other boards, such as the Midland Health Board, take a much more liberal view. This is not equality.</P>
    <P>Children in County Roscommon are being discriminated against with the endorsement of the Department of Health and Children solely due to their geographic location. This flies in the face of the Department's guidelines and the Constitution. These issues can only be resolved by the provision of adequate funding to recruit additional dentists and orthodontists in the Western Health Board region. The Minister must not allow the current situation to continue, where children sitting at the same school desk but living in different counties receive a different health service. If grandparents live in County Westmeath parents try to transfer their children to be covered under that area to ensure they get a proper dental or orthodontic service. There is a two-tier system in terms of health board regions with a huge disparity in the service being provided in south Roscommon and south Westmeath because they are in two separate health board regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for allowing me the opportunity to discuss the orthodontic services in the Western Health Board area and the children's dental services in south Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> Orthodontic treatment services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant led orthodontic service which ensures a service of high quality and high service levels. My Department has made additional resources available to the health boards to assist with the development of their orthodontic services in accordance with the action plan.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board, with the assistance of funding from my Department, has established a regional orthodontic unit at Merlin Park Regional Hospital. The unit is headed up by a consultant orthodontist. Three whole-time dentists and three part-time dentists currently provide services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant. My Department has given approval for an additional £150,000 in the year 2000 for the future development of the board's orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>The demand for orthodontics is much greater than can be provided in any developed country. The provision of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is very expensive. It is important, therefore, that resources are used as efficiently as possible for those patients most severely affected. Accordingly, the Western Health Board, in line with the other health boards, assesses patients for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department in 1985 and, where appropriate, places individuals on waiting lists. I am concerned at the size of the waiting lists nationally and I have asked my officials to review the situation in relation to this issue. As the Deputy is aware it is not just an issue of funding. There are far more deeper issues in the service which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Dental treatment services for children are also being developed by health boards in accordance with the dental health action plan. For the past number of years health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and have phased out a demand led service. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care. The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.</P>
    <P>Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth classes, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach. The children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified via this programme and the required level <Col N="679" /> of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc., is provided as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some health boards can have difficulty in filling dental posts in geographically remote areas and in fully implementing the school based approach. In the case of the Western Health Board region, the board has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining appropriately qualified dentists to provide services in some areas such as south Roscommon. Unfortunately, this has resulted in an inability on the board's part, despite its best efforts, to provide an adequate level of service for the school children in the south Roscommon area. The board has held interviews on a number of occasions over the years in an effort to fill vacancies as they arise and staff from other countries, including Britain and Germany, have been employed at various times. It is open to any qualified dentist to respond to an advertisement placed by the board. The board is also in continuous contact with the dental training schools in an effort to recruit temporary staff.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that some developments are currently taking place which should help the Western Health Board with its persistent difficulties in recruiting and retaining dentists. Following successful conclusion of the negotiations carried out under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency, I have asked the health boards to implement revised structures for dentists employed within the health board dental services. Under these revised structures additional duties will be assigned to existing staff and additional promotional outlets will be created. The revised structures are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the dental services. It should also help to increase the attractiveness of employment within the health board dental services making the public dental services an attractive career option to new graduates as well as appealing to dentists returning to this country after working abroad. I am quite hopeful that the restructuring of services will ease recruitment difficulties being experienced by many boards.</P>
    <P>Also, in view of the exceptional difficulties encountered by the Western Health Board and following approaches made by the board, my Department has given approval for a pilot project to be carried out in order to further address the problems being encountered in relation to recruitment and retention of dentists in the health board dental services. Under this pilot project health board dentists working after hours in certain specified areas may provide services for children who have left national school on a fee per item of service. This pilot project encompasses south Roscommon. The arrangement is to operate strictly on a pilot basis for six months and will <Col N="680" /> be closely monitored by both the Western Health Board and my Department.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the measures outlined above will considerably improve the dental service in the Western Health Board region and that all eligible children will receive an adequate service while in national school and thereafter up to their 14th birthday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Penrose. I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter. The issue of personal safety is of vital importance to our elderly population, particularly in a society where the extended family is being subsumed by small nuclear family units, many of which have opted for urban lifestyles. The changing pattern in society has left many older people living alone in rural areas. Contact with their families is often limited to telephone conversations and weekly visits. As a measure to reflect this change in lifestyle, every effort should be made to ensure that the personal safety and security needs of older people living alone are catered for.</P>
      <P>The community support scheme for older people, which was introduced by Deputy De Rossa during the last Administration, was an important contribution in addressing the security needs of elderly people. The scheme was introduced mainly in response to a spate of attacks on older people in their homes, most of which took place in rural areas. Under the scheme a grant of up to 90% was made available to cover the cost of personal safety alarms. Since the scheme was first introduced in 1996, over 30,000 older people have secured extra protection for themselves and their spouses. However, this scheme was introduced with a view to being extended and developed, and was not intended to be left on the shelf without modifications to reflect the rapid changes in society.</P>
      <P>I am aware that until recently there was a significant backlog in applications which were put on the long finger due to inadequate funding. Furthermore, I am aware that the grant aid for the scheme was significantly reduced in some areas, falling from the original 90% funding to as little as 39%. However, the main point I wish to address is the fact that the socially monitored alarm provided under the scheme is virtually inaccessible to older people living in more isolated areas. This is because the alarm is accessed in the main through community alert schemes or community groups which are in a position to apply to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for a grant covering 90% of the cost of the alarm. As I have already pointed out, the availability of 90% funding is now sadly an aspiration for the majority of applicants who in reality get a much reduced sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Older people living in isolated rural areas with no community alert scheme do not have the mechanism through which they can apply for the grant assistance for a socially monitored alarm. The only option open to them is to purchase the alarm, and I understand that the cost could be in the region of £400, a sum which is out of the reach of most elderly people. It is grossly unfair to two neighbours, one might be able to afford it while the other cannot. It is ironic that those people most isolated are those with least access to safety and security provisions.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to immediately make provision to allow older people living in areas where no community alert scheme operates make an application for a grant to cover the cost of the alarm directly to his Department. Furthermore, it is necessary that resources be made available so that 90% funding is sustained at all times under the scheme. I see no reason the grant for the purpose of fitting alarms could not be increased further as many older people have great difficulty in coming up with the necessary 10%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me. As she indicated, the reason this matter is being raised is that we, like our colleagues on both sides of the House, are particularly concerned about the personal safety of our elderly population. As was stated, the pattern of society has changed significantly in the past two decades, with many elderly people living alone in isolated rural areas. These people depend on visits from their family or may be lucky enough to have a telephone to make contact with the outside world. Also, the postman is often the conduit through which these people communicate with the outside world.</P>
      <P>It behoves us to make the personal safety and security needs of elderly people a priority. Since 1996 about 30,000 have availed of the grants scheme which covers the cost of the personal safety alarm. The very essence of the scheme was to ensure that the personal safety alarms were available to those who needed them and it was anticipated that the grant would cover up to 90% of the cost of the alarms, but, as my colleague pointed out, this was an illusion. Alarm costs rose in line with the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's call for the Minister to ensure that in areas where no community alert scheme, community service organisation or appropriate organisation for the elderly exists and where eligible applicants for the scheme reside, the grant should be paid directly to the applicant, who is very often isolated. I am aware of numerous such examples in County Westmeath and despite the best efforts of community groups to cover all these areas, it is not always possible. The grant should be paid directly to the applicants and <Col N="682" /> should be increased to meet the full cost of the alarm to overcome these obstacles. It costs approximately £400 to install an alarm and that is a small price to pay for the safety, comfort and security of our elderly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter regarding our older citizens. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people by providing funding for small-scale security equipment, such as door locks, window locks, socially monitored alarms etc. To receive assistance under the scheme applicants must be aged 65 or over, reside alone or with other dependants and must not be in a position to cover the once-off cost of installing the necessary equipment.</P>
      <P>Since the Government came to office, a sum of £13 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1999 68,444 people had been assisted under it. My colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, is anxious to ensure that it continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and, accordingly, a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in the Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>The funding made available under this scheme is provided by way of grant aid for voluntary groups and organisations which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. This is a key element in making the scheme what it is. The involvement of voluntary organisations in identifying those vulnerable older people in the community in need of assistance under the scheme was recommended by the task force on the security of the elderly as a means of ensuring the greatest level of local involvement and providing the best opportunity for meeting individual needs.</P>
      <P>The involvement of such organisations in identifying and addressing the security needs of older people in the community creates opportunities for them to develop wider links with these people in their areas and has the potential to increase, in a very real sense, the support network available to vulnerable older people in the community while also allowing for a flexible response to individual needs. The knowledge of local conditions and people that local voluntary organisations possess has also allowed for a sensitivity of approach in administering the scheme. The Minister appreciates that individuals may not always be aware of which voluntary organisations in their area actively participate in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Department, through its various offices throughout the country, seeks to assist such individuals by advising them of which groups at local level are participating in the scheme and by putting them in touch with such groups if necessary. In addition, the Department aims to <Col N="683" /> ensure that individuals are aware of the scheme by ensuring that it is widely advertised on a  national basis and by disseminating information on the scheme through a range of voluntary organisations and through the community liaison section of the Garda Síochána. Disseminating information in this way also ensures that vulnerable older people in the community who may not be aware of the scheme's potential benefits can be targeted for assistance by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister is anxious to ensure that the <Col N="684" /> scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in the community and will review it on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to meet this objective in the most efficient and effective way possible. If the Deputies have specific cases in mind, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs local regional offices will be glad to assist in finding a suitable solution to any difficulty citizens have.</P>

      <P>The first progress report of the high level group on road safety, published in July 1999, records good progress in 1998-99 towards the primary target of the Government road safety strategy of reducing road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 &ndash; 3% fewer people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997 and 12% fewer people were seriously injured in 1998 than in 1997. This represents the lowest number of serious injuries for the last decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target of at least a 20% reduction.</P>
      <P>More recent provisional data from the Garda Síochána indicate that there were 413 road deaths in 1999 compared with 458 in 1998. This would represent a reduction of some 13% in road deaths relative to 1997 in the second full year of operation of the Government strategy.</P>
      <P>The report also describes progress on key strategy actions. Evidential breath testing for drink driving is in operation in four Garda stations and will be introduced in an additional 20 stations in the coming months; on-the-spot fines have been introduced to a wider range of road traffic offences, including stop and yield sign infringements, traffic light infringements, defective tyres, and non-wearing of seat belts; additional mobile speed detection units have been commissioned by the Garda and arrangements for the operation of fixed cameras on a number of major routes are being finalised; there has been a significant increase in the number of detections of road traffic offences &ndash; 175,000 on-the-spot fine notices were issued for speeding in 1999 compared to 71,000 in 1997; there was a 29% increase in 1999 over 1997 in certifications by the medical bureau of road safety in drink driving cases presented by the Garda; over 25,000 seat belt notices were issued under the new regulations in the last five months of 1999; £500,000 has been provided in 2000 for a new scheme of specific accident reduction measures on non-national roads; £100,000 has been provided for the medical bureau of road safety in 2000 to commence a major two year drug driving research project, and the national car test commenced in January 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the scheme of a new road traffic Bill is being drafted in my Department to provide for a penalty points system. Subject to satisfactory resolution of constitutional issues, this Bill will be <Col N="686" /> finalised shortly with a view to publication by mid-2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>An estimated 380,000 provisional licences were current at end 1999. The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2000 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing to road safety, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of the measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
      <P>To attain this longer-term goal, the short-term priority is to restore waiting periods for driving tests to acceptable levels. Very significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 101 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by more than 90,000 tests to more than 200,000 tests annually. Two new test centres have been provided in Tallaght and Raheny. I will keep under review the question of recruitment of further testers, as necessary, to meet a quality service target of ten weeks maximum waiting time by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Measures have been in place for some years and will be maintained, to restrict the long-term holding of provisional licences. In addition, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is in the process of finalising recommendations for improving access to motor insurance for young people. The possibility of affording greater credit for the holding of a full driving licence may arise in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> In 1999, 153,389 applications for driving tests were received and 138,176 tests were conducted. A total of 81,864 applicants passed and 88,476 were awaiting a test at the end of 1999. Information on the number of provisional licence holders who have not applied for a driving test is not available.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the increasing environmental problems being created by the difficulty in disposing of old cars; the discussions, if any, he has had or will have with the motor industry regarding this matter; his views on whether the motor industry should take some responsibility in this area; the plans, if any, he has to make regulations under section 29(4)(h) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, to require the motor industry to make arrangements for such disposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of waste disposal and recovery activities, including the dismantling or recovery of vehicles and the recovery of scrap metal and other metal waste, are subject to the requirements of the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998. Such activities require a permit, with appropriate conditions, which cannot be granted by a local authority unless it is satisfied that the activity will not cause environmental pollution.</P>
      <P>In 1998 my Department initiated discussions with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry towards a producer responsibility initiative in relation to old cars or end of life vehicles. Proposals on an ELV management system for Ireland were submitted by SIMI in December 1999. I am currently examining these proposals, and it would be my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme not later than the autumn.</P>
      <P>The SIMI proposal takes account of a draft European Parliament and Council directive on end of life vehicles. This contains a number of provisions, including measures aimed at preventing waste from vehicles; increasing the recovery of ELVs and their components; ensuring that economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs, and ensuring that vehicles are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SIMI proposal has been developed in consultation with the dismantlers organisation, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, and metal merchants, with whom my Department has also held discussions. Agreement on the establishment of a voluntary industry-led scheme is my preferred approach to the management of end of life vehicles and pending a successful outcome on the current SIMI proposals, I have no immediate <Col N="688" /> plans to take specific legislative measures on this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The DTI strategy, which was published in 1995 with a planning horizon to 2011, provides the framework for a wide range of initiatives to respond to Dublin's transportation needs. These include major infrastructural projects such as Luas, the Dublin port tunnel and completion of the Dublin C-ring; other improvements in public transport such as quality bus corridors; and traffic and parking management measures.</P>
      <P>Progress with the construction and planning of these infrastructural projects is indicated in current work being undertaken on the DART extensions and the southern cross motorway, and ministerial approvals to the Tallaght-Abbey Street and Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green links of the Luas, the Dublin port tunnel and the south eastern and northern motorways. By end-1999, an estimated £500 million had been invested in Dublin transport management and infrastructure within the DTI framework. Under the national development plan, more than £3 billion is provided to continue DTI related funding through the period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>Good progress is being made with implementation of the DTO short-term action plan which is designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2000. For example, all 150 of the planned new buses have been delivered; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the QBC network with three QBCs now in operation; the programme of platform lengthening is well under way; delivery of the additional DART rolling stock and railcars has commenced; and the upgrading of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line is due for completion by end 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the office of director of traffic, Dublin Corporation, has been established to bring greater concentration and efficiency to traffic administration within the city and has <Col N="689" /> already achieved significant improvements in parking enforcement and traffic engineering.</P>
    <P>For the longer term, the DTO is now finalising an update to the original DTI strategy, taking account of the strategic planning guidelines published in 1999 and of a planning horizon to 2016. This work is underpinned by extensive research, including origin and destination studies, undertaken by the DTO and its constituent bodies.</P>

      <P>While I am not opposed to the introduction of weekend voting, I remain to be convinced that it would make a major difference to voter turnout. National polls have now been held on all days from Tuesday to Friday and the recent Údarás na Gaeltachta elections were held on a Saturday with no dis<Col N="690" /> cernible trend in improved voter turnout from one day to another. A move to weekend voting would require careful consideration of a range of matters, including the likelihood of competition with sporting events, difficulty in obtaining election staff, increased staff costs, the large numbers now employed in the service industry at weekends, people being away from home and serious reservations from the main religions with Sunday voting.</P>
      <P>Overall, it is not clear that more people would have an opportunity to vote if elections and referendums were held on a Saturday or Sunday. The essential difficulty with this issue in relation to voter turnout is that in attempting to accommodate one group of voters by choosing a particular polling day, another group is likely to be inconvenienced. Nonetheless, it is a matter that I will keep under consideration, including the option of holding elections over a two day period, including a Saturday or Sunday.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol is to limit the net increase in emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases to 13% above 1990 levels in the period 2008-12.</P>
      <P>A number of measures are currently in place to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the transport, residential, industrial, agricultural, waste and commercial sectors. These are outlined in Ireland's second national communication under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since the preparation of this report in July 1997, there have been a number of further policy developments which, <i>inter alia</i>, address climate change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For purposes of the preparation of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to meet Ireland's Kyoto commitment, a consultancy study on the limitation and reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland was published jointly by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise in June 1998. This was subsequently used as a basis for public consultation and a discussion forum for interested bodies, organisations and individuals who made sub<Col N="691" /> missions on the study report. Both the submissions made, and the wide-ranging discussion at the forum, were utilised in the development of a draft national greenhouse gas abatement strategy.</P>
    <P>Last year I invited Comhar, the national sustainable development partnership, to consider and make recommendations on the draft strategy. My Department is now at an advanced stage in preparing a final draft for Government consideration as a priority, having regard to the views of Comhar, executive interdepartmental input through the green network of Departments, and other developments, including the recent Green Paper on Sustainable Energy published by the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>As part of overall policy development in this area, I also established a consultation group on greenhouse gas emissions trading to assess this option as it affects Irish policy formation. The group is examining the option of a domestic emissions trading market as well as the implications for Ireland of an international trading regime, and I expect to have its main report in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Work is ongoing on the Local Government Bill, which is at an advanced stage of drafting and is intended for publication in the current Dáil session. The Bill is substantial with more than 200 sections; it will consolidate and modernise local government law, implement a range of reforms and generally underpin the programme of local government renewal. The Bill will, <i>inter alia</i>, include provision for the direct election of cathaoirligh of county and city councils from the next local elections in 2004. As part of the programme of local government renewal a whole series of initiatives designed to transform local government have already been taken; and action is well in hand across a range of fronts. A new funding system is in place; a major planning Bill is before the Oireachtas; constitutional recognition has been accorded to local government, together with a fixed electoral cycle; the partnership model is being introduced <i>via</i> the strategic policy committees; modern financial management, accounting and VFM systems have been developed; strengthened management structures are ready for implementation; the first element of a training programme for councillors is complete; funding is being provided for a one-stop-shop initiative; the next phase of SMI for local authorities is about to <Col N="692" /> be launched; and county-city development boards are currently being established. All in all these and other initiatives represent a major programme of action for the renewal of local government which the Local Government Bill is intended to support and underpin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question refers to current work by the European Commission, which has involved some informal consultation with member states, and which is aimed at developing a new and comprehensive Commission proposal to counter the alcohol and drug factor in road accidents. There is also an earlier Commission proposal, presented in 1988, for the harmonisation of blood alcohol limits at 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood; this has not however been progressed by the Transport Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the current European Commission work which involves the EU high level group on road safety, my Department's contribution to the consultations has been based on the principles already set out in the Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002. These recognise the relatively recent introduction of the 80 milligrams blood alcohol limit in Ireland, and the <Col N="693" /> consequent priority to improve compliance with this requirement rather than to move to new limits. The Government strategy also recognises that, in recent years, more EU member states have either moved from an 80 milligrams to a 50 milligrams blood alcohol limit, or are considering such a move; and the possibility that the European Commission may reactivate its proposal for a harmonised EU limit of 50 milligrams. The strategy concludes that the Government will follow the progress of these developments, as well as progress towards relevant national road safety targets, in considering the adequacy of the present 80 milligrams limit in Ireland.</P>

      <P>As I explained in my reply to Question No. 83 on 26 January 2000, my Department met last year with the Conference of Religious in Ireland, the representative body of the Church of Ireland and the Irish Episcopal Conference regarding land or property surplus to these bodies' requirements and which could be converted to residential use or development. All of the religious bodies were supportive <Col N="694" /> of releasing any surplus land or property for social and affordable housing projects at agreed terms and gave an undertaking to carry out a survey within their organisations of the lands which may be available.</P>
      <P>A reply was received from the Conference of Religious in Ireland last month which indicates that the amount of land likely to become available in the near future is small, with only five instances of available land or property being identified. The Irish Episcopal Conference has written to say it is happy to assist the Department in undertaking a survey and the results of the survey are awaited. The results of the survey being carried out by the representative body of the Church of Ireland are also awaited. Further discussions will be held once the replies from the three religious bodies are received and examined by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Government recommitted itself in An Action Programme for the Millennium which was reviewed last November to identify surplus State lands in the larger urban areas with a view to releasing these for housing development. On foot of this, the compilation of a register of all State lands in the ownership of Government Departments and agencies, which would identify lands that are likely to be disposed of in the next few years, is under consideration by my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the taking in charge of estates is essentially a matter for each individual local authority and my Department does not systematically collect such information. However, the Department did carry out an informal survey of local authorities in 1998 on the extent of the problems with unfinished housing estates and the factors contributing to such problems. Replies received from 77 of the 88 planning authorities revealed that 706 housing estates were then regarded as unfinished, which, along with a further 542 finished estates, had not been taken in charge. The estates varied in size from two to 200 houses. My Department does not have available any estimate as to the funding which would be required to take all of these estates in charge.</P>
      <P>New requirements on planning authorities concerning the taking in charge of unfinished estates are provided in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. The Bill provides that where an estate has been completed to the satisfaction of a local authority, the authority must take an estate in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request that the authority do so. Where an estate is unfinished, and the period, seven years, for taking enforcement action has expired, and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will also be obliged to take the estate in charge.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own expenditure requirements in the context of its annual Estimates. Expenditure arising on the issue referred to by the Deputy would be dealt with by local authorities in this Estimates context. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources, including the local government fund and other State grants, rates and fees and charges. For future provisions from the Exchequer for the local government fund, regard will be had to the resource implications of the Planning and Development Bill.</P>

      <P>The 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing our Ways, encouraged local authorities to adopt a regional approach to the waste management planning process with a view to the more efficient provision of services and infrastructure. Grant assistance of more than £1.1 million was provided for local authorities under the EU-funded Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99, to undertake regional-local studies for purposes of informing the preparation of new plans. In this regard, 32 authorities were involved in or have adopted regional waste management strategy studies, or are otherwise committed to the making of regional waste management plans.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 241 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following publication of the Bacon reports, the Government acted promptly and decisively, implementing a range of measures in its two policy documents, Action on House Prices, April 1998, and Action on the Housing Market, March 1999, to maximise and expedite housing supply to meet demand, secure house price stabilisation, address affordability issues and ensure balanced growth of the housing market in the future. Measures introduced by the Government have clearly taken effect to maximise housing output and moderate house price increases. Principal supply side measures include the serviced land initiative, which will provide more than 100,000 additional serviced sites, fast-tracking of key infrastructural projects to increase the supply of <Col N="697" /> land for housing, and measures to ensure better utilisation of housing land, including higher densities at appropriate locations. The results of these actions are reflected in increased output, with over 46,500 completions nationally in 1999 which is up 9.8% on the 1998 total. Houses are being built at over twice the 1993 level, and we are on track towards a target of 50,000 completions per year.</P>
    <P>Other Government initiatives that are helping to assist affordability for lower income and first-time purchasers include withdrawal of investor incentives, reduced stamp duty rates and improvements to the local authority shared ownership and affordable housing schemes, while the £3,000 grant continues to be available to first-time purchasers of new houses. Single earners and families on single incomes of up to £20,000, which is above the average industrial wage, qualify for both the shared ownership scheme, under which over 1,350 houses were purchased in 1999, a 68% increase on 1998, and for the affordable housing scheme which was launched in March 1999. The Planning and Development Bill will also underpin the supply of adequate housing land which will contribute to the provision of social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that house price increases are moderating. Provisional figures for 1999 indicate average house price increases of approximately 16% for new houses and 18% for second-hand houses on a national basis &ndash; well below the peak rates of increase recorded in mid-1998. This moderating trend is confirmed by other independent house price surveys.</P>

      <P>Section 22 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, requires local authorities to make waste management plans in respect of their functional areas. These are now being prepared on a regional and local basis having regard to national policy set out in the 1998 statement, Changing our Ways, and with statutory objectives to prevent or minimise the production and harmful nature of waste; encourage and support the recovery of waste; ensure that such waste as cannot be prevented or recovered is safely disposed of, and address the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle, in relation to waste disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While reducing reliance on landfill is a key national objective, it is acknowledged that situa<Col N="699" /> tions may arise where local authorities face an imminent shortage of waste disposal capacity. In this regard, advice on addressing short-term landfill capacity problems is contained in Changing Our Ways, on the basis that interim solutions should not prejudice the outcome of longer-term strategic solutions.</P>
    <P>A number of measures are in train to support the efforts of local authorities to deliver a radically improved waste management performance. Investment of £650 million in waste management infrastructure is indicated in the national development plan, and this will be largely funded by public-private partnerships. A specially resourced unit has been set up in my Department to pursue the implementation of public-private partnership arrangements, and this will provide advice for local authorities with regard to procurement of necessary waste management infrastructure.</P>
    <P>My Department has formally invited the construction industry to develop proposals for a producer responsibility initiative aimed at meeting proposed recovery targets for construction and demolition waste, and this is being progressed by a special task force of the forum for the construction industry. The motor industry has also been invited to develop proposals in relation to end-of-life vehicles, while initial discussions have taken place with industry concerning waste electronic and electrical equipment.</P>
    <P>A policy statement on recycling and waste recovery generally is currently in preparation. This policy document will address the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area, and outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in support of better recycling performance.</P>

      <P>The waste management plans, currently being developed and adopted by the local authorities, generally incorporate proposals for household segregation and kerbside collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas; an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas, typically with a target density of one facility per 500 population; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; and a range of waste treatment and disposal facilities.</P>
      <P>These facilities, systematically planned and provided, will create a viable framework in volume terms for the development of material recycling and reprocessing capacity. In addition, relatively low waste disposal costs have militated in the past against a good recycling performance and waste recovery generally. This situation is changing as local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for the waste services which they provide. However it must also be recognised that the financial viability of waste recycling is dependent on the development of more extensive and stable markets for recyclable materials.</P>
      <P>Producer responsibility initiatives offer considerable potential to bring industry's expertise to bear to devise workable and least-cost arrangements for waste recovery on a sectoral level. In addition to the current industry led schemes for packaging waste and farm plastics, I expect substantive progress this year on similar initiatives with the construction industry and motor industry sectors.</P>
      <P>In addition the full benefits of the European Regional Development Fund investment of £7.7 million since 1997 in respect of some 70 individual projects for the development of recycling infrastructure in Ireland are currently coming on stream.</P>
      <P>A policy statement on waste recycling and waste recovery generally is currently in preparation. This policy document will address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area, and outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in support of better recycling performance.</P>

      <P>The October 1998 policy statement on waste management &ndash; Changing our Ways &ndash; recognises as fundamental to efficient waste management that all producers of waste pay fully for its collection, treatment and disposal. Changing our Ways specifically recommends that local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for waste services that they provide, and, as <Col N="703" /> a matter of equity and to incentivise waste reduction, the level of waste charges imposed by local authorities should vary according to usage.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are empowered by the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 to charge for the services that they provide. While the majority of authorities now charge for waste collection and disposal, the imposition of such charges is a matter for each local authority and one in which I have no function.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 117 of 26 January 2000.</P>
      <P>I was invited to meet the Oireachtas JointCommittee on the Constitution to discuss electoral reform and I did so, along with former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, on 9 February 2000. While I would have liked these discussions to be held in public I was advised by the chairman that, as the committee was not established by resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas, television facilities would not be available nor would the committee enjoy parliamentary privilege.</P>
      <P>At the discussions on 9 February I reiterated my personal view, conveyed in earlier correspondence and in reply to a questionnaire circulated to Deputies and Senators, that we should change our electoral system to one using STV in single seat constituencies. I also indicated that, in order to ensure proportionality and representation for smaller parties and individuals, it would probably be necessary to incorporate a list element. It is now a matter for the committee to consider these and other views and I look forward to the publication of its report which will, I hope, provide the basis for an informed public debate on our electoral system and the scope for reform.</P>

      <P>Section 2(2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992 sets an objective for the board of determining every appeal or other matter within a period of four months. Reflecting the growth in the economy generally, there has been a major escalation in the number of appeals coming before the board since mid-1995. The number of cases received by the board was 4,708 in 1999; this compares to 3,424 in 1996.</P>
      <P>In 1999, 47% of cases were determined within four months. This compared to 63% in 1998, 82% in 1997, and 93% in 1996. The number of cases disposed of by the board in 1999 was 4,632, the highest in any year and an increase of 14% on 1998. It is of significance that the deteriorating trend in the percentage of appeals decided within the four month objective was reversed during 1999; the percentage of cases determined within four months increased from 42% in the April-June 1999 quarter to 52% in the October-December 1999 quarter. I am continuing to monitor, in conjunction with the board, the situation to see what further measures, additional to those I have already taken to enhance the board's performance, may need to be put in place to expedite the processing of appeals and clear the backlog which has built up.</P>

      <P>Significant progress has already been made in the development of the PPP approach to water services. Details of projects which have already been initiated on a PPP <Col N="705" /> basis are set out in the following table. Based on experiences so far, the Department considers that this approach offers potential benefits over traditional procurement for certain major projects. Consequently, in January 1999, my Department issued a circular to local authorities on procurement through the use of design-build and design-build-operate contracts. This circular indicated that while each case would be determined on its merits, for projects involving the provision or upgrading of major water or wastewater treatment works, the policy would be to favour the DB or DBO approach unless there were strong reasons against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan includes a target of £100 million in private finance to support public investment in the area of water supply. In seeking to meet this target the Department has <Col N="706" /> identified the sector involving the provision or upgrading of water supply and treatment facilities as being the most suitable for the use of private finance.</P>
    <P>Further details on PPP projects in water services can be expected when the water services investment programme for the year 2000 is announced. In the context of the serviced land initiative, a number of projects are being examined for implementation using the PPP route.</P>
    <P>I propose to issue a circular shortly clarifying Government policy in regard to the application of the polluter pays principle to the non-domestic water services sector. No change is proposed to the present policy regarding domestic water consumers. The procurement method of a project, through PPP or traditional arrangements, is a separate matter which will not affect Government policy in this regard.</P>

      <P>The national waste database, 1995, prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that 35% of construction and demolition waste was recovered annually. I understand that an updated national waste database report for 1998 will shortly be published by the agency.</P>
      <P>The national policy statement on waste management, Changing our Ways, 1998, recognised the primary responsibility of the construction sector for environmentally sound management of construction and demolition waste, and set targets to recycle at least 50% of construction and demolition waste within a five year period, with a progressive increase to at least 85% over 15 years.</P>
      <P>My Department has invited the construction industry to develop proposals for a producer responsibility initiative to meet these targets. A dedicated task force under the forum for the construction industry is due to present a co-ordinated industry-wide programme in this regard, with an implementation timetable, by 1 July 2000.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 15 February, accepted the recommendations of the cabinet committee on infrastructural development on an integrated package of changes to the existing statutory approval and judicial review processes. In addition to the major changes already included in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, to underpin the accelerated delivery of infrastructure under the national development plan, I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage of the Bill to implement those elements of recommendations which are relevant to the planning code. These include: providing that ministerial directions can be given to An Bord Pleanála to prioritise specific areas of major infrastructural investment within its work programme; removing the statutory prohibition on developing a road scheme pending the outcome of all legal proceedings, including judicial review; requiring the High Court should deal as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the administration of justice, with judicial review of significant planning and infrastructure cases; requiring that applicants for judicial review should have previously shown an interest in the case in respect of which judicial review is sought, unless there is good and sufficient reason why he or she did not do so; requiring that any person seeking to extend the exceptions to the eight week time limit for seeking judicial review of a decision of An Bord Pleanála should have to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed that I would urgently address with my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, the legal and organisational implications of the establishment of a single decision making process for infrastructural projects affecting the foreshore. Contacts on this issue are ongoing between our two Departments and, depending on the outcome, may result in further amendments to the Planning and Development Bill.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, will fundamentally strengthen the role of local authorities in meeting the housing needs in their areas, including the need for social and affordable housing. Part V of the Bill will require each local authority to prepare, as part of its development plan, a housing strategy which must provide for the current and future housing needs in its area, including the need for social and <Col N="708" /> affordable housing. The Bill requires local authorities to ensure that sufficient land is zoned for housing needs for the period of the development plan and that a specified percentage, not being more than 20%, of such land shall be made available to the local authorities at existing use value for the purposes of social and affordable housing.</P>
      <P>Separately from the provisions of the Planning and Development Bill, local authorities are being encouraged by my Department to acquire the land required to meet the social and affordable housing output targets identified in the national development plan and more particularly to meet the target of 22,000 housing starts in the multi-annual local authority housing programme for the period 2000-03. The Housing Finance Agency assists local authorities with funding for land acquisition. The cost of any land acquisition, including holding charges incurred for up to five years, used for the development of local authority housing is funded by the housing capital allocations from my Department. My Department also meets the cost of loan charges relating to land acquired by a local authority to provide houses under the local authority affordable housing scheme. The subsidy is payable for a maximum period of three years or until the houses are constructed and sold, whichever is the lesser.</P>

      <P>A press release by the European Commission on 11 January <Col N="709" /> 2000, <i>inter alia</i>, indicated its intention to initiate proceedings concerning drinking water quality problems associated with private group water schemes and the adequacy of national regulations, having regard to the requirements of Directive 80/778/EEC. Formal notification of proceedings has not been received in my Department. I refer to the reply to Question No. 28 on today's Order Paper which outlines the extensive programme under way, and substantial funding in place, to resolve quality problems in rural water supplies.</P>
      <P>The Commission initiated court proceedings in respect of the incomplete transposition of Article 7 of Directive 87/217/EEC on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos on 27 January 2000. This is now the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Proceedings have been initiated before the European Court of Justice in respect of the failure to implement Directive 75/442/EEC, as amended, on waste, Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and Directive 94/62/EC on packaging waste, with regard to the making of waste management plans. Ireland was originally given until 13 January 2000 to lodge a defence. The Attorney General's office, with the support of the Commission, formally requested an extension of time which would allow the now advanced waste management planning process to be fully completed. An extension to 24 March 2000 has been granted by the court.</P>
      <P>Proceedings have been initiated before the European Court of Justice in respect of failure to implement Directive 97/68/EC concerning emissions of pollutants from engines in non-road mobile machinery. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, made the European Communities (Control of Emissions of Gaseous and Particulate Pollutants from Non-Road Mobile Machinery) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 396 of 1999) on 14 December 1999. These fully transpose the directive into Irish law and I expect they will enable the court proceedings to be concluded without further action.</P>
      <P>Proceedings at an earlier stage, by way of reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the Treaty on European Union, have been notified to Ireland by the Commission in relation to specific issues arising under Directive 76/464/EEC on the protection of water against pollution by dangerous substances, Directive 75/442/EC, and amendments, on compliance with waste legislation and Directive 91/692/EEC on the submission of reports on the implementation of water directives. A reply has issued in each case and the Commission response is awaited.</P>

      <P>Information and statistics on recycling performance in 1999 are not available at present. I understand the Environmental Protection Agency will shortly publish a national waste database for 1998. In view of the difficulties experienced in Ireland and internationally in relation to the recycling markets generally, some underachievement of targets set in 1994 may be unavoidable. In regard to factors influencing recovery and recycling performance, and action planned and under way in these regards, I also refer to the replies to Questions Nos. 25 and 59 on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>At 31 January 2000 some 89,400 applicants were on the waiting list for a driving test. Of these, some 28,700 have been given test appointments and some 15,600 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested. Due to limitations in the IT system, involved information on the average waiting time by centre is not available. The current position in relation to longest waiting periods by test centre is however set out in the table below.</P>
      <P>Very significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 101 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to over 200,000 tests annually. Two new test centres have been provided in Tallaght and Raheny. I will keep under review the question of recruitment of further testers, as necessary, to meet a quality service target of ten weeks maximum waiting time by the end of this year. As indicated in reply to previous questions, I am determined to bring progressive and substantial improvement to the quality of the driving test service provided for the public; and in particular to end present excessive and unacceptable waiting times: a maximum waiting period of ten weeks is being targeted by the end of this year.</P>

The necessary investment to provide for expansion of the local authority and voluntary housing programmes, increased support to facilitate home ownership for lower income households, the implementation of the local traveller accommodation programmes, the improvement of the physical condition of the social housing stock and other targeted home improvement measures has been provided for in the investment of £6 billion for social and affordable housing contained in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The programme reiterates the Government's commitment to comprehensively address the problem of homelessness. In this regard, the report of the cross Department team on homelessness is currently being finalised and its recommendations will be examined urgently by my Department. As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the report of the commission on the private rented residential sector, which is due by June of this year, will provide the basis for reform of the private rented sector.</P>

      <P>The most recent assessment of local authority housing needs and of homeless persons was carried out in March 1999. Using a broader definition of homeless persons which includes those who have no accommodation, those in hostels and in health board accommodation, there were 5,234 persons categorised as homeless.</P>
      <P>I am aware of efforts being made in other countries to tackle homelessness. The Government is committed to addressing the problem of homelessness, including, where possible, using the experience gained in other countries. This experience points towards the need for a comprehensive response to homelessness and this was acknowledged in the establishment of the cross-Department team on homelessness whose remit includes health, education, employment as well as accommodation needs. The team will present its report in the near future with recommendations on how the problem of homelessness should be addressed.</P>

      <P>Tax incentives were included in the Finance Act, 1999, to encourage private sector participation in the development of park and ride facilities in major cities, including Dublin. I issued guidelines in August 1999 on the criteria and requirements to be met by park and ride facilities and associated residential development for which tax relief is sought. Further guidelines will be issued in due course relating to tax incentives for associated commercial development when the necessary EU approval for such incentives has been obtained.</P>
      <P>While I am not aware that any local authority has, to date, issued a certificate under section 70 of the Finance Act, 1999, I understand that a number of private sector proposals for park and ride facilities may be at an early stage of development. In addition, DTO traffic management grants in 1999 included a total of some £2 million for the development of park and ride facilities in the Dublin area. Some 2,300 park and ride car parking spaces, mainly rail-based, have been provided to date under this programme which is continuing on the basis of funding to be provided by the DTO, as well as own resources expenditure by Iarnród Éireann and local authorities.</P>

      <P>FÁS is responsible for scheduling apprentices for all off-the-job phases in FÁS training centres and in the institutes of technology. All apprentices must be registered with FÁS, and each apprentice is required to undertake the training and assessments of all phases. Where possible, apprentices are assigned to FÁS training centres or to institutes of technology according to geographic catchment. Apprentices will be allocated training places in the institute of technology geographi<Col N="718" /> cally closest to them unless they specifically request a different institute of technology.</P>
      <P>All apprentices must be registered by their employers with FÁS within two weeks of commencing their apprenticeships. Phase two training places are allocated based on the apprentice's date of registration with FÁS. Subsequent progress through the apprenticeship depends on the successful completion of the modular and competence assessments at each stage. Therefore apprentices are allocated places on phase four and six training according to the length of time that they have been eligible to attend for that phase.</P>
      <P>The normal timescale for the three off-the-job phases is that phases two, four and six should be attended during the first, second and third year of apprenticeship respectively. Given the unprecedented increase in the numbers entering apprenticeship during the last three years, some delays have occurred in some trades, despite significant expansion of training places available to apprentices for the off-the-job training phases. In all cases, FÁS issues letters to both the apprentices and their employers advising of the course arrangements. There is then a process of follow-up contact with the employers in order to maximise apprentice release and course attendance.</P>

      <P>Apprentices from the construction, engineering &ndash; excluding electronics &ndash; and printing and paper sectors which have been subject to the apprenticeship levy are paid a training allowance by FÁS. Apprentices employed by firms in other industry sectors continue to be paid apprentice wages by their employers during the off-the-job phases. Wage rates as paid to apprentices by their employers are a matter between the apprentice, the employer and, as appropriate, the trade union concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal arrangements for the off-the-job phases are that phase two, four and six training is delivered during the first, second and third year respectively. The training allowance is normally based accordingly on first, second and third year wage rates, such allowance being based on what the individual would normally receive if being paid the agreed industry apprentice wage norm by the employer. Due to <Col N="719" /> the unprecedented increase in the numbers entering apprenticeship during the last three years, some delays have occurred in apprentice placement in off-the-job training in some trades, despite significant expansion of training places available to apprentices for the off-the-job training phases.</P>
    <P>In the case where an apprentice is called for an off-the-job training phase at a later stage than would be normal, and where the delay has been caused by an inability to provide the training place at the normal time, FÁS bases the training allowance on the apprentice's current year-of-apprenticeship wage norm. In such <Col N="720" /> circumstances, the maximum training allowance is based on the fourth year apprentice wage norm.</P>

      <Quest> the situation in regard to a new project for the former Atlantic Mills site at Clondra, County Longford; and if the Government will support a purchase of the site by the IDA for an industrial park in the event of failure to find a major project. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations for the sale of the Atlantic Mills site, for a new textile operation, to an interested party did not succeed. IDA has now actively resumed marketing the Atlantic Mills facility in Longford. A new marketing programme is under way through IDA's network of overseas offices.</P>
      <P>I established the Longford interagency group in December 1998 following the closure of Atlantic Mills at Clondra. The group is examining the issues that require attention in order to enhance Longford's potential to attract further overseas investment. Longford is a priority location for IDA who are working closely with the inter-agency group and with local business and community interests to actively market Longford for inward investment. IDA is confident that success will be achieved in the county in the coming year. My announcement on 16 February 2000 of Donnelly Electronics' intention to establish a manufacturing operation at Longford is a very positive development for the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that there is adequate provision of property for the purposes of industrial development in the State. The main elements of the policy in relation to industrial property include industrial land is to be provided by IDA Ireland directly and, where possible, in partnership with the local authorities and the private sector; provision of industrial buildings is to be made by the private sector;  the State should minimise its involvement in the pro<Col N="722" /> vision and ownership of individual buildings; and IDA Ireland should, as far as is practical, dispose of its holdings of industrial buildings.</P>
    <P>The management of the industrial property portfolio is a day to day matter for IDA Ireland. While no new factory space is now provided directly by IDA Ireland, the agency relies instead mainly on private developers and grant assistance to industrial investors to provide their own premises. However, IDA Ireland still plays a crucial role in ensuring there is adequate land zoned and developed for industrial purposes in the regions it serves.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties which have arisen for some owners of fishing boats in claiming on their insurance policies after loss; if she has satisfied herself with the regulatory regime in relation to insurance agents and to rein surance arrangements and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that I have received correspondence concerning the difficulties which have arisen for some owners of fishing boats. I am having the individual cases examined at present. I cannot stress too much the importance of placing insurance with or through EU-authorised companies. No direct life or non-life insurer may operate within the EU unless they are authorised to do so. My Department can quickly confirm to anyone seeking insurance, whether a company is authorised within the EU.</P>
      <P>By contrast, most EU countries, including Ireland, do not authorise or supervise reinsurance companies at present. However, in Ireland we are introducing measures which will subject reinsurance companies registered in Ireland to authorisation and supervision procedures.</P>
      <P>The majority of the reinsurance companies registered in Ireland contribute positively to Ireland's international reputation as a high quality financial services centre. One reinsurance company, not based in the IFSC, has been the subject of unfavourable reports for some time, including reports in the Irish media. I am also aware of a number of IRNR, Irish registered, non-resident, companies registered as reinsurance brokers, whose activities have also given rise to concern, particularly in the area of marine insurance. As far as can be ascertained the companies concerned operate exclusively outside of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition to the company law measures which have been taken to address the general IRNR issue, I have introduced regulations under the Insurance Act, which came into effect at the end of December 1999, which prescribe a detailed form of notification to be completed by new reinsurance companies.</P>
      <P>Also, the existing arrangement, whereby the Companies Registration Office will not register a new reinsurance company until it has been vetted by our Department's insurance division has been reinforced. Finally, the new Insurance Bill, which is currently before the Dáil, provides that the information to be provided by reinsurance companies under last year's regulations must be updated annually. It also brings reinsurance brokers within the new statutory system of supervision of insurance intermediaries. It also makes provision for the possible introduction at a future date of a statutory system of detailed authorisation and supervision of reinsurance companies, on the lines of the system that currently applies to insurance companies.</P>

      <P>The following are the terms of reference of the review group on auditing: (a) whether self-regulation in the auditing profession is working effectively and consistently; (b) whether any new or revised structures and arrangements are necessary to improve public confidence and, if so, what form should they take; (c) the role of the external auditor in providing other services to the same institution; (d) the impact of other functions such as tax advice and consultancy on the external audit process; (e) the determination of fees, bearing in mind shareholder interests; (f) the relationships between an external auditor and the management that appoints and remunerates him; (g) the statutory provisions on auditing in the Companies Acts and related codes; (h) the role of the external auditor in ensuring compliance with statutory provisions; (i) the possible role of the Central Bank in regard to management letters issued by external auditors to financial institutions; (j) the possible strengthening of audit standards relating to financial institutions; (k) the suitability of having joint auditors to financial institutions with one being appointed by the Central Bank; (l) the possible introduction of a maximum term of five years for an auditor to a financial institution; and (m) any matters directly related to the foregoing.</P>
      <P>These terms of reference are broader than that recommended in the DIRT inquiry report of the Committee of Public Accounts to the extent that I have also asked the review group to evaluate self-regulation in the auditing profession, that is, the first terms of reference above. The group has been asked to report to me by 31 May next.</P>

I am satisfied that the group comprises sufficient consumers of auditing services in the form of State, business and employee representatives and academic members.</P>

      <Quest> if she has examined the case being made by the Irish Institute of Credit Management; if she will make a statement on its contention that unscrupulous directors are availing of the strike-off provisions in the law by failing to file the necessary annual returns and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>I have recently received correspondence from the Irish Institute of Credit Management outlining its views on alleged difficulties associated with the present strike-off regime. I will be issuing a full reply to the institute's concerns shortly.</P>
      <P>The Companies Acts, 1963-1999 permit the strike-off of companies from the Register of Companies in circumstances where a company fails to file returns or where the registrar has reasonable cause to believe that a company is not carrying on business. The Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 has recently provided that a company is eligible for strike-off after failing to file an annual return for one year. Previously, the period of eligibility was two years.</P>
      <P>The Act has also made it easier for a creditor to restore a company to the register after strike-off by providing that such an application may be made to the Circuit Court rather than the High Court. It also now provides that the Circuit Court may appoint a liquidator to a company after it is struck off. Rather than denying creditors their entitlement, I would suggest that the recent legislative changes have in fact facilitated applications by creditors for the re-instatement or liquidation of a company.</P>
      <P>In its representations to me, the Irish Institute of Credit Management has suggested that the strike-off process is being used as a vehicle for tax evasion. I understand that the registrar of companies has had a series of meetings with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the new Act, and I am assured that Revenue plans to make full use of the powers available to it to counter any threat of tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute also suggested that the current strike-off policy may be unconstitutional. As the 1999 Act was drafted by the Office of the <Col N="726" /> Attorney General taking account of constitutional considerations, I am satisfied that it is compatible with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The current strike-off process is also consistent with the thrust of the Working Group on Company Law Compliance and Enforcement which advocated a stronger enforcement of company law.</P>
    <P>I note that the institute will be making a full submission on a number of related issues to the new Company Law Review Group. However, in the light of the above considerations, I do not intend to accede to the institute's request to suspend the current strike-off process, pending completion of the review group's report.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme, JI, is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of the programme is to progress participants into mainstream employment. The first phase of participants have completed their term and are now availing of a six month extension in order to address any training or development needs that the participants might have, and to allow time for the local employment service to engage more actively with participants to facilitate their progression to employment in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>In general, a redundancy situation exists where the employer dismisses the employee because the place of employment is being completely or partially closed down, or the employer's requirements for employees of that kind, or with those qualifications has decreased. In the case of JI participants the programme is being continued at the same level, therefore, a redundancy situation will not occur in the majority of cases. An entitlement to redundancy would appear to be limited to situations where a sponsor is withdrawing from the programme, or JI participants are not being replaced.</P>
      <P>The full implications of the Redundancy Payments Acts for the ongoing operation of the JI are currently being actively considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that there is representation for coarse angling interests on the regional fisheries boards. The elected members of the regional fisheries boards are elected by classes of electorate specified by order made under the Fisheries Act, 1980. The classes of electorate include the class of a person who is an ordinary member of a fisheries co-operative society and who is registered as a coarse fish angler with that society and who is entitled to vote. In the case of the Shannon board and the northern board the order specifies that two members shall be elected by this class of electorate and in the case of the other five boards the order specifies that one such member shall be elected.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy, the &ldquo;Investment Programme 2000-2006 for the water-based tourism and leisure sector in Ireland&rdquo; was prepared by the Marine Institute and presented to my predecessor during 1999. This report estimated that, with a total overall investment of IR£130 million over the period, coming from both public and private funds, an annual net additional economic impact of IR£184 million by 2006 could be generated.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this report, the Government included specific provision in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for this sector. In the plan, there will be, for the first time ever, a specific focus on the water-based tourism and leisure sector so as to bring development of the sector from its current embryonic state into line with the rest of the tourism and leisure sector. Access infrastructure and integrated product development have been identified as requiring particular investment effort. Within the total allocation for tourism in the Border, Midlands and Western Regional Operational Programmes, an amount of IR£14 million has been set aside for access infrastructure for marine and water-based tourism facilities and IR£10 million for ongoing development for angling and related tourism. A further total of IR£10 million has been devoted to improving marine tourism and tourist related angling facilities within the total allocation for Tourism in the Southern and Eastern Regional Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>This overall total of IR£34 million will form an integral part of the Regional Operational Programme 2000-2006 which has to be drawn up in order to access EU assistance under the Community Structural Funds for that period.</P>

      <P>There are 191 members of the World Health Organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All countries which are members of the United Nations may become members of the World Health Organisation by accepting its constitution. Other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly. Territories which are not responsible for the conduct of their international relations may be admitted as associate members upon application made on their behalf by the member <Col N="734" /> or other Authority responsible for their international relations.</P>
    <P>UNICEF is a fund established by the United Nations on foot of a General Assembly resolution in 1953. The executive board of UNICEF consists of 36 UN member states on the basis of equitable geographic representation and other relevant factors. The UNICEF board consists of eight African states, seven Asian and Mediterranean states, five Latin American and Caribbean states and 12 Western European and other states. Membership of the board is normally for a period of three years. Ireland will next become a member of UNICEF's executive board in 2002.</P>

      <P>Ireland Aid has a valuable and long-standing partnership relationship with Irish NGOs active in development and humanitarian relief assistance. Last year's OECD review of Ireland Aid confirmed that our funding through NGOs is high by international standards.</P>
      <P>Support for development activities carried out by NGOs may be funded under a number of headings within the bilateral aid programme including the NGO co-financing scheme, the human rights and democratisation scheme, and the emergency relief and rehabilitation assistance scheme. Funding arrangements are related to the purpose of the various spending programmes and not the nature of the recipient organisations. Funding is intended to support activities rather than organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> In recognition of their capacity and track record, five of the largest Irish NGOs &ndash; Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Self Help Development International and Christian Aid &ndash; receive an annual block grant from Ireland Aid for development projects. This provides both recipients and Ireland Aid greater administrative flexibility and allows block grant recipients freedom to select projects within agreed criteria. My Department is currently in discussions with these NGOs concerning putting these arrangements on a multi-annual basis.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements in respect of Ireland Aid &ndash; NGO collaboration are working well. I believe that no practical purpose would be served by having a separate NGO budget line, as it would still be necessary to apply existing criteria to funding applications for different activities.</P>
    <P>Details of all funding to NGOs are contained in the Irish Aid annual reports, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <Quest>the representations, if any, which he has made to the Israeli authorities in connection with the proposed visit of the Pilgrim House community to Israel; and the response of the Israeli authorities to those representations.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6245/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pilgrim House Community applied in July 1999 to the Israeli Embassy in Dublin for visas for an eight month stay in Israel. The community consists of a number of adult Irish nationals, an adult Colombian national and a number of children, six of whom are Romanian citizens. Irish and Colombian nationals do not require visas for stays in Israel of less than three months but Romanian nationals do require visas.</P>
      <P>On 14 September the community was informed by the Israeli Embassy that their application had been refused and the following day the Irish ambassador in Israel wrote to the Israeli authorities asking that they reconsider the application. The ambassador in his letter pointed out that the Pilgrim House Foundation is a registered charity involved with the mentally handicapped and that they had sufficient funds to support their stay in Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 September the community told our ambassador in Israel that they were departing for Israel by road and that their hope was that by the time they arrived at Haifa in Israel the visa issue would have been resolved. They were advised to continue to press their case directly with the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. The community arrived in Haifa on 10 October without visas. They were refused entry and the Israeli authorities compelled them to return to the ship from which they had disembarked. The ambassador travelled to Haifa as soon as he heard of what had happened. <Col N="736" /> Before doing so he contacted the Israeli authorities to say that he was extremely concerned about the manner in which the group had been treated by the immigration authorities at the port. On his arrival he asked the Israeli side to reduce their presence. He contacted the Israeli foreign ministry and emphasised strongly the manner in which the group was mistreated and manhandled. He asked the Israeli authorities to reconsider their decision and to permit the group to land.</P>
    <P>The following day, 11 October, after the Israeli foreign ministry had informed the ambassador that the Israeli authorities, having reviewed the facts at their disposal, had decided that the group would have to leave Israel, my predecessor, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. David Andrews spoke in Luxembourg with the Israeli Foreign Minister. He asked Mr. Levy to intervene to resolve the situation as a matter of urgency. He told him that respected clerical figures had testified that the community were bona fide pilgrims and said that the matter could adversely affect relations between the two countries. Simultaneously, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs called in the Israeli Chargé d'Affaires to convey the same message and to urge the authorities to grant entry. Later that day a member of Minister Levy's entourage claimed that the decision to refuse visas had been made on foot of information given to the Israelis by the Garda. The Israelis then informed the ambassador that their authorities viewed the arrival of the community without visas as a &ldquo;provocative&rdquo; step as they had been advised by the Israeli Embassy in Dublin not to travel to Israel without the necessary visas. The community departed Haifa later on the same ship on 11 October.</P>
    <P>The group had been described in the Israeli newspapers as a doomsday cult, extreme sect, etc. and similar stories appeared in the Cypriot, Greek and Irish newspapers. It would appear that this misrepresentation of the community came from Israeli sources.</P>
    <P>The community remained in Greece from 14 October until 8 November while efforts continued to have their application for visas reconsidered. Their movements were watched closely by the Greek police.</P>
    <P>While the community was in Greece the ambassador in Tel Aviv wrote on several occasions to the Foreign ministry in this connection. He repeated that the community is a legally registered charity and that they are known as a very committed group of people. He raised the question of the complaints of police mistreatment in Haifa. On 19 October the Israelis again repeated the decision not to allow the group to enter Israel.</P>
    <P>There was continuous contact between the Irish Embassy and the Israeli authorities during the month of November but without any fundamental change in the Israeli position. By early December the community had arrived in France and the Embassy again asked the Israeli auth<Col N="737" /> orities to reconsider the question of entry to Israel, specifically to allow them spend Christmas there. The community now said they were prepared to go to Israel for less than 90 days. My predecessor, Deputy David Andrews, wrote to the Israeli ambassador in Dublin on 8 December last again asking the Israel authorities to reconsider. This was pursued the following day with a letter from the Irish ambassador to say the community hoped to arrive on 20 December and to depart on 18 March. A letter from an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform confirming that, on the basis of information supplied by the Garda authorities, the group in question had not come to notice here in relation to engaging in unlawful activities or as representing a threat to public order was passed on to the Israeli authorities.</P>
    <P>On 16 December my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wrote to the Israeli Ministers for the Interior and for Public Safety. This followed discussions between a representative of the group and an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform during which the representative accepted that the description of the group was an accurate one in an Irish context but they were concerned at the interpretation of this description by the Israeli authorities. In the letter my colleague acknowledged the Garda authorities had described the community as a radical Christian group but he explained that should not be seen as critical of their behaviour or lifestyle. In this connection he emphasised that they had not come to notice here in relation to unlawful activities nor as a threat to public order.</P>
    <P>Following further meetings involving our ambassador to Israel and the Israeli ambassador to Ireland the Israeli authorities eventually informed us on 21 December that they had not changed their mind. In a letter of 28 December the Minister for Public Security in Israel, Ben Ami, said that upon receipt of Minister O'Donoghue's letter he requested a review of the matter. He said that for the time being the request could not be granted. Should the group apply for entry permits as tourists at a later stage the request would be given due consideration with a view to providing a solution. On 14 January Minister O'Donoghue wrote again to his counterpart reiterating what had been said in his previous letter.</P>
    <P>On 20 January last my predecessor again wrote at length to the Israeli Foreign Minister. He said the community had been harshly and unjustly treated and that representations by the Irish Government appeared to be of no avail. He asked the Israeli Foreign Minister to use his best efforts to enable the admission of the community to Israel without further delay. Five days later my predecessor met with representatives of the community while on a visit to Strasbourg. These efforts produced a positive response when on 1 February the Department of Foreign Affairs was informed by the Israeli ambassador that the Mini<Col N="738" /> ster for Public Security, Ben Ami, had withdrawn his objection to the visit. However, a number of conditions were set, for example, the visit could not take place until after 31 March, it should only last for 30 days and guarantees should be given about health insurance, etc.</P>
    <P>Following further representations from the community about the conditions attached to the visit by the Israeli authorities I wrote, on 3 February last, to Foreign Minister Levy. I rejected the inference that they were a security risk and pointed out the practical difficulties for the community of having to wait until April. I asked that they be allowed to make a visit of at least eight weeks.</P>
    <P>When I was informed that it would not be possible to accede to my request I asked our ambassador in Tel Aviv to make further direct approaches on my behalf to the Israeli side specifically on the date of arrival and on the duration of the visit. Following consultations there the ambassador reported that the Israeli authorities will not be amenable to any further representations and that they will hold firm to their decision of 1 February.</P>
    <P>I can understand the wish of the community to visit Israel as soon as possible. However, the question of permission to enter Israel remains a matter for the Israeli authorities. It is evident that they have reconsidered the matter as a result of our many representations and have said they will grant permission to the group to visit after 31 March. There is, we understand, a possibility that they will grant an extension beyond the 30 days for the visit.</P>
    <P>In the meanwhile I have asked our ambassador to continue to press the Israeli authorities for a response to the complaints of mistreatment made by the group when they originally landed at Haifa on 10 October.</P>

      <Quest>the discussions, if any, she has had with her British counterpart regarding the falsification of plutonium data at British nuclear fuels Sellafield plant, particularly in view of the statement made by the British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that the events at Sellafield showed a fundamental flaw in the management of BNFL which has to change.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6240/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>A report of the findings of an investigation carried out by the UK's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate into the falsification of MOX fuel pellet quality assurance data at the BNFL MOX Demonstration Facility at Sellafield was published on 18 February 2000 by the NII.</P>
      <P>The MDF has been closed since revelations about the falsified data emerged in September last from which time the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has, at my request, been maintaining contact with the NII.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> The NII report concludes that systematic management failure and significant shortcomings in the suitability of the MDF plant and safety culture contributed to the falsification of data. The report requires that the MDF plant will remain shut down until key recommendations in the report relating to rectification of quality checking processes and improvement of plant management and operations to bring about the required safety culture at the plant are implemented by BNFL to the NII's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The falsification of quality assurance data represents a serious indictment of safety standards at Sellafield. This report, along with two other reports on Sellafield, also published on the same date, raises serious question marks about the control and supervision of the plant and is a matter of the utmost concern to the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Immediately following the release of these reports, I instructed the RPII to meet the NII chief inspector. This meeting took place last week. I also wrote to the UK Ministers, M. Helen Liddell, whose Department oversees the NII, and Mr. Michael Meacher, expressing the Government's strong concerns about the findings of these reports and requesting that they give careful consideration to the suspension of operations at Sellafield, at least until the shortcomings at Sellafield are addressed. I also informed them that the onus is on the UK Government to demonstrate that its regulatory systems are adequate to overcome these problems and sought assurances that the risk to Ireland would be minimised. I have also sought an urgent meeting with Mini<Col N="740" /> ster Liddell which I expect will take place as soon as she returns from the United States. I am awaiting a response to my letters.</P>
    <P>Even though the MDF plant is closed and the NII has assured the RPII that the current operations at the site are safe, the fact remains that the NII, in its report on the control and supervision of operations at the Sellafield site, has questioned the safety standards at the Sellafield plant and has given BNFL two months to produce a programme for responding to the safety recommendations in the report. I will, therefore, be pressing UK Minister Liddell, in the strongest possible terms, for a suspension of operations at Sellafield at least until the safety deficiencies at the plant are addressed. In the meantime, I have asked the Attorney General's office to examine the NII reports to see if there are any grounds for taking legal action against BNFL. If I believe following the advice of the Attorney General that there is non-compliance with the provisions of international law, I will not hesitate to undertake appropriate litigation.</P>

      <P>Any use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter which falls to be considered by me, in consultation with the Minister for Defence, in the context of overall airports policy.</P>
      <P>The position of Baldonnell was considered in the recent consultancy report on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction which assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> I note that, with regard to Baldonnel, the advisers see no reason for the Government to hinder commercial development at the aerodrome subject to appropriate planning and Irish Aviation Authority approvals. They believe, however, that while the development of a corporate jet facility on a commercial basis could be viable, a larger scale passenger airport development at Baldonnel would be commercially challenging.</P>
    <P>These issues are addressed in the advisers' report which is now publicly available. I am now giving careful consideration to the findings and recommendations of that report and I will be submitting my proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a consultancy report commissioned by Shannon Development found, among other things, that the feasibility of constructing a rail spur from the Limerick-Ennis line to Shannon merited further detailed study. Such a study would, of course, have to determine the cost both of constructing and operating the line. My officials recently met representatives of Shannon Development and the consultants to discuss the study.</P>
      <P>My Department has indicated to Shannon Development that all the recommendations in the study might best be considered in the context of the Limerick planning, land use and transportation study which has been jointly commissioned by Limerick Corporation, Limerick County Council and Clare County Council.</P>

      <P>Security and reliability of supply is one of the main tenets of Irish energy policy. In line with this, the ESB operates a mixed fuel policy in the generation of electricity including the use of peat in a number of peat stations.</P>
      <P>The EU electricity directive contains provision for the use of indigenous fuel, for security of supply reasons, for up to 15% of primary energy requirements. The directive also makes separate provision for a public service obligation mechanism relating to security of supply.</P>
      <P>There is no change in Government policy on the continued use of peat on security grounds in the generation of electricity.</P>
      <P>On 17 February 2000, I announced a new milestone framework for the electricity market in Ireland. I indicated that, following consultations with the EU Commission in Brussels, two new state of the art peat stations, to be owned by ESB, would be built over the next few years in addition to the state of the art peat fired plant currently under construction in the East Midlands by Edenderry Power Limited. In the meantime, existing peat stations producing electricity will operate under an interim PSO arrangement to facilitate orderly closure as the new stations come on stream.</P>
      <P>The scenario outlined above is an optimum one which: guarantees the continued use of peat as a fuel in the generation of electricity for reasons of security of supply; provides environmental and efficiency requirements through the use of modern state of the art technology; and underpins longer term employment in the production of peat.</P>

      <Col N="754" /> The maximum grant of £10,000 will be reduced by any grant aid taken up in respect of the farm since 1994 with regard to pollution control investments under the control of farm pollution scheme, the dairy hygiene scheme and the farm improvement programme in the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry.</P>

This person also had a milk quota of 23,928 gallons in 1999, which when divided by his average yield of 922 gallons, accounts for 25.95 livestock units. The balance of livestock units available for the special beef premium is 1.69.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made the following applications for special beef-bull premium: five animals on 8 March 1999 and 11 animals on 22 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Four of the animals listed on the first application were proper to the ten month age category. The remaining animal was submitted for bull premium but was ineligible on age grounds. The 11 animals on the second application were proper to the ten month age category.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned is only entitled to payment on 1.69 livestock units payment can only issue in respect of 2.81 animals. (1.69 divided by .6) 90% amounting to £216.50 has issued in respect of 2.81 animals. The remaining animals are not due payment as the person named has exceeded his stocking density limit. They are, however, deemed to have received the premium for the category for which they were deemed eligible. Applications for special beef premium, once submitted, cannot be subsequently withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The European Commission is currently finalising the draft guidelines on Leader+ and incorporating the observations of the European Parliament which have been accepted by the member states.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the commission will shortly issue the approved guidelines and based on the member states will draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible. The commission, over a period of some months, will examine these programmes to ensure that the required standard for approval is evident.</P>
      <P>Additionally, a Leader mainstream programme is being funded under the national development plan.

      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and Leader mainstream activity under the national development plan, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the commission's intention is that funding for Leader+ will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustained development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the determination of local groups for delivery of programmes, the report of the Task Force <Col N="758" /> on the Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader type rural development programmes. Every effort will be made to establish the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures.</P>
    <P>In this context, it may be possible to progress the mainstream Leader measure which will apply nationwide at a more rapid rate then Leader+ will allow. I am examining this possibility. In the meantime, I have allocated funding to Comhar Leader na hEireann <i>inter alia</i> to ensure that existing groups are fully familiar with the administrative requirements in regard to mandatory financial reporting of the conclusion of Leader II projects.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the sheep headage scheme that applicants must have a minimum of three hectares to qualify for payment. The person registered under herd number U1091235 agreed to an amendment to her 1999 area aid application to allow two parcels of land included in her application to be transferred to another herdowner's application thus reducing the area on her own application to 0.71 hectares. Consequently, she does not satisfy the minimum three hectares required in order to qualify for headage payments.</P>
      <P>Similarly in the case of herdowner U1051829 the executor of his estate agreed to an amendment to the 1999 area aid application, giving another herdowner the right to claim the only parcel of land on the application. Since it is a condition of the sheep headage scheme that applicants farm at least three hectares the executor cannot be paid sheep headage in respect of the deceased herdowner's application unless it can be shown that she was compelled to let the holding of the deceased for acceptable <i>force majeure </i>reasons.</P>

      <Quest>if there was an agreement with the farming organisations in Agenda 2000 that his Department would be farmer friendly; the way in which he reconciles this with the situation where farmers are severely penalised for genuine errors in filling their area aid and other grant application forms; his views on whether it is fair that farmers can suffer the penalty of 100% loss of all livestock grants due to a genuine error; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6000/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development </P>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): My Department has always sought to be farmer friendly and considerable efforts have been made in recent years to enhance that position by the introduction of the charter of farmers' rights and the customer service action plan. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department is committed to  the introduction of a new protocol by 30 June 2000 for direct payments dealing specifically with applications, inspections, administration, penalties and their categorisation, payment deadlines, appeals, and monitoring; the automating and streamlining to the extent possible, of the documentation and procedures relating to FEOGA schemes; the establishment on a statutory basis of an independent, accessible and properly resourced appeals unit to review decisions made in relation to the payment of grants and the imposition of penalties; and pressing the European Commission to re-examine the penalty regime with particular reference to exclusion penalties applicable to direct payment schemes, and to apply the maximum proportionality in the imposition of all penalties.</P>
    <P>With regard to penalties, it should be stressed that this issue should be kept in proportion and in context. I would like to point out that the total number of livestock applications which attracted penalties under the 1998 headage and premium schemes represented only 2.6% of the 522,000 applications received in that year.</P>
    <P>Some two-thirds of penalties imposed under the headage and premium schemes were attributable to late submission of aid applications by farmers. A further number arose because of a shortfall in the number of eligible animals found by my Department in the course of on-farm inspections.</P>
    <P>The number of applications which attracted a one or two year penalty, that is, false declaration, intentionally or through serious negligence, represented no more than 0.1% of applications in the 1998 scheme year. The vast bulk of these applied in the sheep sector. A one year penalty would apply in cases where, for example, a proportion of ewes applied on are found not to be ewes at inspection. A two year penalty would apply where, for example, a farmer made application for premium/headage on sheep which he did not have at the time of application or indeed at time of inspection.</P>
    <P>In general, where an applicant makes an error in the completion of an application form my Department allows an opportunity to correct such errors. The most common error over the past few years has been the incorrect transcription of tag numbers on application forms. The level of such errors has however greatly decreased in the past year following the more widespread use of new information technology in the processing of the special beef premium scheme whereby farmers are no longer required to list the individual eartag number of all animals being applied on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> Given the overall value of these direct payments to farmers and the fact that that value is set to increase following from the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, it is inevitable that the EU Commission will wish to ensure that reasonable levels of controls are in place in the various member states.</P>
    <P>Since January 1999, greater emphasis has been placed on the need for farmers to fully respect the regulatory requirements for the identification and registration of bovine animals. These requirements are particularly important in the context of traceability and the national beef assurance scheme.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious, however, of the need to simplify the application and processing arrangements for the various direct payment schemes and to ensure that penalties are kept to a minimum. In the course of the negotiations on the detailed rules for implementing the Agenda 2000 changes and in the discussions on changes to the integrated administration and control regulations, my Department raised the question of simplification and proportionality of penalties. Some success was achieved in that regard.</P>

      <P>Under the EU hormone ban, those third countries where use of the hormones concerned is allowed for growth promotion purposes may export to the Union only product which has been produced free of hormones. In April 1999, the European Commission announced that tests conducted on 258 samples of bovine beef and liver imported from the US in the period May-November 1998, and produced under the US Hormone Free Cattle Programme, revealed a 12% positive level for three of the hormones in question. Following this discovery, mandatory testing at EU border inspection posts of all consignments imported from the US was introduced. In addition, following intensive dialogue between the EU and the US and recent on the spot inspections by EU inspectors of US systems, the US has been given until 15 March 2000 to fully satisfy the EU that its systems provide the necessary guarantees. In the event that the 15 March, 2000 deadline is not met there is provision for an EU-wide ban on imports from the US of meat for human consumption to come into effect.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of having received an application from the persons named for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 1999 national reserve.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for premium on 18 suckler cows under the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme on 3 June 1999. As they held a quota of 18 premium rights and as the animals they applied on were deemed eligible, they qualified for payment on all 18 animals.</P>
      <P>A 60% advance payment of £1,437.91 issued on 1 November 1999 and a euro compensation top-up of £127.62 on 20 December 1999. A balancing payment of £958.61 issued on 7 February 2000 making a total payment of £2,524.14 which is their full entitlement.</P>
      <P>The persons named have applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the year 2000 national reserve but as the demand for reserve quota far exceeded the amount available for distribution, applicants with a low level of livestock units are being given priority.

      <P>The agricultural prices proposals for 2000-01 were agreed by the EU Commission on 23 February, 2000. The only proposal affecting Irish agriculture is the proposed reduction in the monthly increments on the cereals intervention price from one euro-tonne at present to 0.93 euro-tonne for the 2000-01 marketing year and 0.85 euro-tonne for the 2001-02 marketing year. The Commission has justified this proposal on the grounds that it is in line with the price cut for cereals decided under the Agenda 2000 agreement.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement reached by the EU heads of Government in Berlin in March 1999 established the framework for the Common Agricultural Policy for the period 2000 to 2006 and any changes to that framework can be decided only by the Heads of Government. It is my firm position that there should be no dilution of the benefits to Irish agriculture from the Agenda 2000 agreement and I will maintain that position in forthcoming meetings of the Council of Ministers in relation to both the 2000-01 price proposals and any other proposals which the Commission may put forward.</P>

      <P>Information on the number of applications refused under REPS, the scheme of early retirement from farming and control of farmyard pollution scheme is not maintained centrally in my Department. Efforts are being made through local offices of the Department to collate the information sought and it will be forwarded to the Deputy in due course, together with details of applications under consideration. I can say, however, that a total of 18,427 applications were received nationwide under the control of farmyard pollution scheme 1994-99. Of these, 2,243 were made in Galway and this was the largest number for any county. Of the Galway applications, some 175 were later cancelled. Some 2,012 payments have issued in <Col N="769" /> respect of approved works which have been completed in County Galway.</P>
      <P>All valid CFP applications have been approved and paid, except in cases where the investment works have not yet been completed.

All REPS application, are subject to a desk check and more than 50% are subject to on farm inspections. These controls, which are necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulation, are carried out as expeditiously as possible. Where they give rise to follow up action, this must be completed before payment can be processed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the scheme of early retirement from farming, delays have arisen because of the large volume of applications which are dealt with by local office staff in conjunction with other high priority work. These delays have been exacerbated by the large number of applications received in the closing months of 1999. Notwithstanding the volume of cases on hand, every effort is being made to minimise delays in processing.</P>

      <P>Details of the external consultancies, work groups and specialist groups currently employed for carrying out studies in my Department are as follows.</P>
      <P>On 8 October 1997 the equality committee of the human resource implementation group commissioned a team led by the IPA, with members from the Department of Statistics and Centre for Women's Studies in TCD and Goodbody Economic Consultants, to produce a report on the topic: Gender Equality in the Civil Service. The final report will be published within the next four to five weeks.</P>
      <P>The commission on public service pensions was established in February 1996 to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements of public servants. As part of this work, the Department of Finance on behalf of the commission engaged a number of consultants to carry out actuarial and other research projects in relation to pension matters. These consultants have reported and their work will be reflected in the commission's final report. The commission is currently in the process of concluding its final report which is expected to be presented to Government in mid-2000.</P>
      <P>Arthur Andersen were hired in May 1997 to review systems for the financial control and management of assistance from the European Regional Development Fund, and of the Cohesion Fund. A report on the European Regional Development Fund has been completed. A report on the Cohesion Fund is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, it is normal practice as the need arises to form <i>ad hoc</i> working groups, composed mainly of officials and which do not involve external consultancy firms.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the tax treatment of the private rented accommodation sector is that the Finance (No. 2) Act of 1998 abolished the deductibility of interest for borrowings in respect of private rented residential accommodation pur<Col N="772" /> chased on or after 23 April 1998, subject to certain transitional provisions. The Act represented a significant part of the Government's package of measures aimed at addressing problems in the housing market. This approach was adopted on the basis of the report on house prices prepared by Peter Bacon and Associates.</P>
      <P>The measures in the Act were framed to address the situation identified in the report that investors were to some extent replacing first time buyers in the market, a development which is totally contrary to the thrust of housing policy over recent decades. The evidence since the Act was passed is that it has been successful in this aim. Restoration of tax relief for private landlords in respect of provision of private rented accommodation would result in a reversal of the improvement in the position of first time buyers brought about by the Finance (No. 2) Act of 1998.</P>
      <P>A further study by Peter Bacon and Associates to assess the impact of the Government action on house prices in 1998 included an assessment of the impact on the market for private rented residential accommodation. This report, which was published last year, did not recommend the restoration of deductibility of interest on borrowings undertaken for investment in residential property.</P>
      <P>In view of the considerations outlined above, I do not propose to make any changes to the tax treatment of the private rented accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>As I said in my Budget Statement and as I have informed the House since then, I propose to modify the existing excise duty rebate on diesel which is available to CIE and to certain other bus operators, by stipulating that this concession will only be available where low sulphur diesel is used. I believe that the introduction of low sulphur diesel in Ireland should result in significant emissions reduction with consequential health and environmental benefits. The improvements are needed now.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that low sulphur diesel is widely available in the UK and that 90% of the market share there is to this standard. I also understand that, with some technical adjustments at its Whitegate refinery, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation will be in a position to supply 50 ppm diesel. It is my own experience that where tax incentives are provided, and the ones available in this case are generous indeed, market forces will respond positively.</P>
      <P>Provision to give effect to the announcement in my Budget Statement has been made in the Finance Bill, currently being discussed in the House. The relevant sections will be implemented by way of a ministerial order, allowing time for the interested parties to make the switch to the cleaner and more environmentally sound low sulphur fuel from the present less cleaner alternative. I can assure the House that I will not sign the order until I am satisfied that supplies of low sulphur diesel can be obtained by transport operators.</P>

      <P>In the context of establishing a new national training fund, I announced in budget 2000 a reduction of 0.7% in employer class A and H contribution rates from April next. I have no further plans to reduce employer contribution rates for the year 2000-01.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that, since 1994, a reduced rate of employers' PRSI has applied in respect of lower earning employees. From 6 April next, a rate of 7.8%, as compared to the standard rate of 11.3%, will apply subject to an earnings limit of £14,560 per annum. This lower rate will apply to more than half of employees insurable at class A, that is, full rate PRSI, including those in the clothing and textile sector.</P>
      <P>In addition, the establishment from April of this year of a national training fund will have an important and beneficial impact in terms of maintaining national competitiveness. Moreover, there will be no additional financial imposition on employers as the introduction of a national training levy, payable in respect of all class A and H employees at a rate of 0.7% on the same income base as employers' PRSI, is being matched by the above mentioned reduction of 0.7% in the current employers' PRSI contribution rates.</P>
      <P>There are several schemes of support for both employers and employees to encourage the employment of long-term unemployed from the live register. Such schemes, including revenue job assist and the back to work allowance scheme, provide additional allowances and PRSI free holidays to employers to further support the reintegration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market, an increasingly important objective given the supply constraints evident in some parts of the labour market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Article 5 of Council Directive 95/59/EC, pipe tobacco comes under the definition of other smoking tobacco in the categorisation of excisable manufactured tobacco in that directive. Article 3(1) of Council Directive 92/80/EEC obliges member states to impose a minimum rate of excise duty on other smoking tobacco which is either 20% of the retail selling price inclusive of all taxes, or 18 euros per kilogram. Subject to the achievement of this minimum, the excise duty may be charged either on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis or as a specific duty expressed as an amount per kilogram or as a mixture of both, combining an <i>ad valorem</i> element and a specific element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excise duty applied here has always been applied as a specific amount by weight. Because the rate applied has always been above the minimum rate set down in EU law, that law has, in practice, no influence on the determination of our rates. On the basis of relative excise duty by weight of product, pipe tobacco has always been treated more favourably than other tobacco products. For example, following the recent budget increase, fine-cut tobacco for the rolling of ciga<Col N="777" /> rettes is taxed at £104.19 per kilogram whereas pipe tobacco is taxed at £85.66 per kilogram.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the point raised by the Deputy, I wish to confirm that I have no immediate plans to review the level of excise duty on pipe tobacco.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the coverage of the 10% rate of corporation tax on profits on manufacturing. The position in relation to this issue is that, in July 1998, following detailed negotiations with the European Commission, an agreement was reached to introduce a single rate of corporation tax of 12.5% across the board on all trading income. The standard corporation tax rate, which is currently 24%, is scheduled to fall to 12.5% by 2003 as part of this agreement. In addition, the existing 10% rate of corporation tax on profits from manufacturing, which was introduced with EU <Col N="779" /> approval in 1980, is being phased out. It is, therefore, not possible at this stage to extend the scope of the 10% manufacturing rate.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy, however, of the special measure, which I announced in my December budget, which is designed to help small and medium enterprises. Rather than waiting until 2003, I have brought forward the 12.5% rate for SMEs and it now applies from 1 January 2000. Thus any SME company whose trade consists of intensive nursery production and whose total trading income for an accounting period does not exceed £50,000, will now pay corporation tax at the 12.5% rate rather than at the standard rate of 24%. This measure, which will greatly benefit all SMEs over the next few years, is provided for in this year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, Register-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for the Superintendent Registrar, Dublin and Registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two separate offices located at Joyce House issuing certificates of births, deaths and marriages, the General Register Office and the above-mentioned Superintendent Registrar's <Col N="780" /> Office on the ground floor, which provides certificates for all births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages occurring within the Dublin city and county area.</P>
    <P>There have been some difficulties with these services from time to time and the Superintendent Registrar's Office is currently experiencing an increase in demand for certificates. A number of measures have been taken over the past 12 months to improve services supplied at Joyce House. In June 1999 the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the Superintendent Registrar's Office, transferred Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages, into new accommodation in the neighbouring Lucia House, which has been specially adapted to ensure that people are enabled to conduct sensitive registration matters with an appropriate degree of privacy. The transfer of registrars from accommodation on the ground floor of Joyce House facilitated the extension of the waiting area in the Superintendent Registrar's Office and improved waiting facilities for applicants for certificates. The board also took steps to improve staffing levels in the Superintendent Registrar's office in order to improve the rate of production of certificates.</P>
    <P>The transfer of the registrars to the new building also facilitated further improvements within the General Register Office, including the extension of the public search room to cater for the increased interest in family research. I also understand that the General Register Office is currently experiencing some delays in responding to postal applications but that additional resources have been provided to resolve this particular problem.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the General Register Office archive conversion project is currently under way in Roscommon. This project involves the capture of the records of over 150 years of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes. In addition my Department, together with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is currently engaged in planning the technological, legislative and structural changes necessary for the computerisation of the registration process. It will be appreciated that both these initiatives, when completed, will make a major contribution to the delivery of a flexible, effective and efficient service.</P>

    <P>The consultative council on hepatitis C was established in November 1996. Its functions are to advise and make recommendations to the Minister, at his request or on its own initiative, on all aspects of hepatitis C. The work of the council is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Prof. Hannah McGee, Health Services Research Centre, Royal College of Surgeons, was contracted on 14 July 1998 by the consultative council on hepatitis C to undertake a review of health services for persons with hepatitis C. Prof. McGee's draft final report has been submitted to the consultative council for comment and it is expected that the final report will be presented to the Minister in March 2000.</P>
    <P>The expert group on hepatitis C was established in September 1997 to make recommendations to the Minister on the clinical and non-clinical management of women who received anti-D which was infected or potentially infected with hepatitis C but who tested negative for the virus. The group's work is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The national blood users group was established in July 1998, comprising a number of specialists with a particular interest in blood utilisation. The functions of the group are to develop blood utilisation guidelines, key quality indicators and protocols for the administration of blood and blood products. Its work is ongoing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> Mercer Ltd. was contracted by the Department on 30 April 1999 to conduct a study into insurance difficulties experienced by certain persons with hepatitis C. Its final report is expected to be submitted to the Department in March 2000.</P>
    <P>A national advisory committee on palliative care was set up in September, 1999. The brief of the committee is to prepare a comprehensive national policy for the strategic planning and development of palliative care services. The committee will report before the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>A working group on elder abuse was established in October 1999. The working group has drawn up a two year time frame which will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, development of a training brief, the organisation of pilot projects, implementation of awareness and training programmes, preparation of evaluation report, and culminating in the presentation of a report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group was set up at the end of 1998 to establish a standard needs assessment protocol covering both the needs of the carers and the care recipient comprising representatives from the Department, the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs, the health boards and the voluntary sector. A pilot project is currently in the process of being established in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group comprising representatives from a number of Government Departments was established in 1999 to develop the national children's strategy. The national children's strategy is being developed to map out a direction for the development of supports and services over the next ten years through a set of realisable goals which will address all aspects of the life of children and young persons. The national children's strategy is being developed with the assistance of two advisory panels, NGO service providers panel and a research and information advisory panel.</P>
    <P>On 31 May 1999 the Department entered into a contract with Drury Communications for the drafting of a national traveller health policy in partnership with the traveller health advisory committee in the Department. A draft of the document is currently being finalised by the committee in consultation with Drury Communications.</P>
    <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland was engaged in August 1999 to inspect manufacturers of medical devices to assess compliance with the European Communities (Medical Devices) Regulations, 1994, S.I. 252 of 1994. The consultancy is due to be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>The Nursing Education Forum was established in January 1999 in accordance with a recommendation of the report of the commission on nursing. The forum is expected to report to the Minister by 30 September 2000.</P>
    <P>The forum on medical manpower was established in May 1998 to consider the entire question <Col N="784" /> of the future medical staffing of hospitals. The forum will publish a report shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 209 together.</P>
      <P>The decision to subject products containing St. John's Wort &ndash; hypericum perforatum &ndash; to prescription-only status was taken following a recommendation from the Irish Medicines Board which is the competent authority in this country for the assessment and licensing of medicinal products. The safety concerns identified by the IMB included effects of the product itself such as hypersensitivity to sunlight together with potential interactions with other medications &ndash; cyclosporin, the contraceptive pill, warfarin, digoxin and the ophylline. Following a submission from the Health Products Alliance last December, the IMB reviewed its decision concerning St. John's Wort and subsequently advised my Department that there were no grounds for changing its recommendation. Further evidence has subsequently emerged confirming the IBM's concerns in this matter, in particular two recent articles in the Lancet, the decision by the Swedish authorities to issue a public health warning statement in relation to authorised St. John's Wort products in Sweden, and the public health warning from the US Food and Drugs Administration regarding possible interactions between St. John's Wort and an AIDS treatment. In light of the foregoing, and in the interest of protecting public health, I have no plans to alter the current regulatory position regarding products containing St. John's Wort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Irish Medicines Board that it does not accept that there has been a ten year delay in considering applications for herbal medicinal products and that all appli<Col N="785" /> cations received under the 1989 review process were considered and many were licensed &ndash; including some vitamin, mineral and herbal applications. I understand that it was apparent at an early stage, however, that many of the herbal applications were not capable of being licensed under Council Directive 65/65/EEC &ndash; being the directive governing the licensing of all medicinal products in Ireland &ndash; and companies were informed at the time that the applications could not be processed.</P>
    <P>The recent debate about St. John's Wort has highlighted the lack of a common approach at EU level to the regulation of traditional medicinal products. While this matter is being addressed by a working group set up by the EU pharmaceutical committee last year, I do not anticipate an early resolution to the difficulties of harmonisation in this area and I have asked my officials and the IMB to investigate the possibility of establishing a simplified interim national licensing system for &ldquo;traditional-use&rdquo; medicinal products which would allow such products to be lawfully marketed in this country. Discussions are at a preliminary stage.</P>
    <P>The regulation of traditional use medicinal products including St. John's Wort was discussed at a recent meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committees on Health and Children and Enterprise and Small Business at which presentations were made by the Health Products Alliance and the Irish Medicines Board together with the Departments of Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand that a transcript of the proceedings will be made available in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The hospital in-patient enquiry collects detailed data on all patient discharges from publicly funded acute hospitals and is the only routine source of information allowing health service treatment costs to be attributed to specific illnesses. Consumption of tobacco increases the risk of morbidity from a wide range of conditions. These include cancers, diseases of the heart and circulatory system, and respiratory disorders. According to HIPE there were approximately 50,000 hospitalisations due to these illnesses in 1998 accounting for an estimated 20% of total hospital inpatient costs. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of these figures since they include all hospitalisations from the specified illnesses irrespective of whether or not they were due to smoking. Data on detailed hospital activity and costs for 1999 are not yet complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International studies indicate that 19% of all deaths in Ireland can be attributed to smoking. <Col N="786" /> This figure derives from the publication Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries, 1950-2000 by Richard Peto and others who used the results of epidemiological studies of mortality in smokers versus non-smokers in the United States to assign proportions of total mortality due to tobacco for each relevant cause of death. Similar proportions are not available for morbidity, and it is, therefore, not possible to estimate with any precision the cost of smoking related illness.</P>
    <P>In terms of improved treatment and prevention services for cancer and heart disease, my Department is in the process of implementing a number of major initiatives. Under the national cancer strategy a sum of £40 million has been spent on the development of cancer services between the years 1997 and 2000. The full implementation of the recently launched national cardiovascular strategy will cost upwards of £150 million with an investment of £70 million required over the next three years. The budget increase in excise duty on cigarettes will assist in providing for further investment in cardiac infrastructure; &ndash; £3.6 million extra provided next year; &ndash; cancer services &ndash; £8.3 million extra next year; &ndash; breast screening; &ndash; £2.4 million extra next year; &ndash; palliative care; &ndash;  £3.3 million extra next year; &ndash; cervical screening; &ndash; £3.6 million extra next year; &ndash; and the prevention and treatment of other smoking related illnesses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183, 200 and 204 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was intro<Col N="787" /> duced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is, therefore, in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under state reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items. There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>
    <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>The provision of eye tests and the employment of practitioners to conduct such tests in County Mayo is, in the first instance, a matter for the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>An adult optical scheme is available to clients in County Mayo. However, the specialist ophthalmology service cannot be provided due to the board's difficulty in recruiting a community ophthalmologist. The Western Health Board advertised the post of community ophthalmologist for the area concerned. Unfortunately, the advertisement did not attract any applicants. In the circumstances the board is meeting with an ophthalmologist on Friday, 3 March with a view to arranging an alternative way of providing the service. This may involve a private purchase of services for north Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 to 190, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The provision of drug treatment services including detoxification facilities for drug misusers in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that there is currently a 17 bed in-patient detoxification unit at Cuan Dara in Cherry Orchard Hospital. There is also a ten bed detoxification unit at Beaumont Hospital. This compares favourably with international standards and guidelines for such facilities which indicate an average of between 0.5 and 1.5 beds per 100,000 of population. In addition the Eastern Health Board provides resources for a post detoxification unit operated by the Merchants Quay Project in High Park, Drumcondra. It also provides funding for a post detoxification rehabilitation unit at Cuan Mhuire in Athy.</P>
      <P>The board is continuing to expand its drugs services including the number of detoxification beds available to drug misusers and will shortly open a 20 bed downstream detoxification unit in St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park and a 12 bed in-patient stabilisation unit is also being developed at Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
      <P>There is currently a waiting list for entering into the detoxification unit of between eight and twelve weeks. This may vary depending on circumstances. During this period of time all individuals who are awaiting a bed in the residential detoxification unit are linked in with an addiction counsellor at community level for ongoing support. Many of these clients are also linked to a methadone treatment programme at local level prior to entry into the unit.</P>
      <P>The board is confident that when the extra facilities open throughput will increase and as a result waiting times for entry into a detoxification programme will shorten.</P>
      <P>Irish Government policy on drug misuse is that a wide range of treatment options should be provided, including methadone treatment, detoxification and other programmes aimed at those addicted to drugs, especially people who are addicted to heroin. The ultimate aim of treatment programmes is to return those addicted to drugs to a drug free lifestyle. Methadone maintenance is internationally recognised as a valid and successful part of an integrated response to the drug problem. It has also been shown that it is possible to reduce the antisocial behaviour of intravenous drug users by taking them into treatment on methadone maintenance programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent report reviewing the services of the Eastern Health Board stated that methadone maintenance is one of the most widely evaluated treatments for opioid dependence worldwide. Internationally, there is a well established research and a clinical evidence-base for substi<Col N="790" /> tution treatment with methadone. On average, methadone maintenance is associated with lower rates of heroin consumption, reduced levels of crime and improved social functioning. A lower risk of premature mortality amongst maintained patients has been reported and substitution programmes have also contributed to the prevention of the spread of HIV infection. The report also found that a number of satellite clinics informally reported rates of 40% plus of those on methadone returning to work. Although it is acknowledged that this may partly be due to the current work climate which exists in Dublin, it also states that this high percentage is very striking as evidence of successful social habilitation or rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>Every patient on presentation to the drug treatment services is given the option of a drug-free route by detoxification, either as an in-patient or as an out-patient. In addition the initial assessment carried out on an individual recommends the most appropriate treatment option for that particular client.</P>
    <P>Detoxification and methadone maintenance are well recognised treatment options for an individual with a history of drug misuse. It should, however, be pointed out that success rates for detoxification either as an in-patient or as an out-patient are generally less than 20%. Support needs to be given to those who complete withdrawal in order to prevent relapse and it is often difficult for a client to maintain abstinence from drugs. The board also has in place a range of counselling and support services which will support drug misusers in their efforts to deal with their addiction.</P>
    <P>With regard to funding for the drug treatment services the following is a breakdown by pay and non-pay categories for the Eastern Health Board since 1997:</P>

    <P>In addition the board employs general practitioners and pharmacists on a contract basis to provide services to drug misusers in their own local areas. At the end of December 1999 there were 154 pharmacists and 122 general practitioners employed for this purpose by the board.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that all professional staff employed by the board in the addiction services, that is, medical, nursing, pharmacy, counselling, paramedical are properly qualified and registered with their relevant bodies. Qualifications are verified before commencement of duty and staff must continue to be registered with the appropriate body while employed by the board.</P>
    <P>In relation to training, some of the specialist staff, such as outreach workers, are given an induction course on commencement of duty with follow up in-service training days. A wide range of in-house programmes are provided for other disciplines on issues such as addiction, suicide, child abuse and constant medical updates. Specific training has been provided for general assistants. The training unit of the board is being expanded and it is envisaged that a more extensive programme will be established for this grade and other disciplines.</P>
    <P>With regard to counsellors, all counsellors are supervised continually by external supervisors as well as receiving specialist training. In September 1999 the board's training unit commenced a two year training course for 20 counsellors. All the trainees are qualified in case management in counselling and on successful completion of the training course they will be eligible to be accredited to the Irish Association of Alcohol and Addiction Counsellors (IAAC) and may be employed as counsellors in the addiction services. This course has been devised and facilitated by the board's training officer and assistant training officer and is overseen by a specialist management committee comprising a consultant psychiatrist, external psychotherapists and an independent moderator.</P>
    <P>The health board endeavours at all times to ensure that staff are properly qualified to work in their particular fields. It does this by adhering to a rigorous selection process, that is, public advertisement of all vacant posts, interview by people with relevant qualifications, experience in addiction services and verification that all staff possess the necessary qualifications and experience as stipulated in the particulars of office for each post. The board also carries out Garda clearance on all staff.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that James Connolly Memorial Hospital was originally a facility for the treatment and care of persons suffering from tuberculosis. It was subsequently redesignated as an acute general hospital and has been developed and expanded to provide a range of acute medical and surgical services. In this regard, upgrading works have taken place over the past number of years and these have included the following: upgrading and expansion of radiology services including provision of CT facilities, upgrading of theatre development, upgrading of medical and surgical block, upgrading of theatres and upgrading of out-patients department.</P>
      <P>I am aware that these measures have not fully met the growing needs of the hospital and that some difficulties with service provision have been experienced at peak periods in certain areas.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to address these difficulties, a major capital development costing in excess of £60 million is under way at the hospital. This proposed development will replace the older buildings on the site spread over a large area, with a modern facility utilising a combination of new buildings integrated with substantially upgraded existing structures. When complete, the development will lead to improved patient facilities and enhanced services in the following areas: accident and emergency services, intensive care, coronary care, medical and surgical day care, out-patients, theatre service and psychiatric service.</P>
      <P>Enabling works have already commenced on the development in anticipation of the tendering process being completed in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>This major development at the hospital reflects the emphasis on the provision of a modern acute hospital to meet the needs of its catchment area and in the meantime I assure the Deputy that, pending the completion of the project, facilities will be maintained to the optimum standard in terms of patient comfort.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>
      <P>An implementation group on the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, was established in 1993 to monitor the Act during the first year of its implementation. Subsequently, a working group to review the operation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 was set up in 1994. This working group recommended amendments to the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which are now reflected in SI No. 225 of 1996. This statutory instrument makes provision whereby health boards may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency. This amendment also permits health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes above the number contracted on 1 September 1993 and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. This amendment is to facilitate health boards which do not have sufficient accommodation in their hospitals and homes to meet the needs of those requiring nursing care and which have traditionally relied on the nursing home sector to meet this need.</P>

      <P>The drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drug refund scheme, DRS. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase in the threshold, the position is that the new threshold refers to family expenditure as opposed to the previous threshold in the DCSS which relates to individual expenditure. In addition, there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to make any adjustments to the £42 threshold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures quoted by the Deputy refer specifically to the increase in food poisoning, defined as bacterial other than salmonella.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland &ndash; FSAI &ndash; which has been in existence on a non-statutory basis since 1997, was formally established by the Government in January 1999. This honours the commitment contained in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium that an independent, science based statutory agency with responsibility for food safety be set up. In July last year, the FSAI took over responsibility for the enforcement of all food safety legislation which had prior to that date been the responsibility of a range of State agencies. The primary function of the FSAI is to ensure that food produced or marketed in Ireland meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. The authority also has a statutory function to foster at all stages of food production from primary production through to final use by the consumer, the establishment and maintenance of high standards of food hygiene and safety.</P>
      <P>The FSAI has a number of initiatives under way that are aimed at protecting public health and reducing the incidence of food borne illness and these include a campaign aimed at raising standards of food safety and hygiene practices among people working in the fast food sector. A breakdown of data from 1999 shows that over 50% of the reported outbreaks were associated with the catering sector of the food industry, most notably the fast food sector which includes takeaway restaurants. The FSAI has produced a guide for takeaway premises because of the relatively high risk associated with ready-to-go meals. Changing lifestyles have increased the demand for fast food, with the emphasis now on speed and convenience. This trend is reflected elsewhere in the world in that 56% of money spent on food in the United States goes to purchase foods eaten or prepared outside the home and this trend is also happening in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;food to go&rdquo; sector is enjoying a rapid growth; retailers are responding to changes in lifestyles by providing ready-to-eat meals and by expanding the range of convenience foods they supply. Some staff working in this area are untrained and inexperienced in food hygiene practices. In many such premises, there can be a rapid turnover of staff which can result in poor hygiene standards and lack of knowledge of good hygienic practices. It is imperative that employees know what causes food poisoning and what they must do to prevent it. The responsibility for good <Col N="800" /> food hygiene practices rests firmly on the owners of these food businesses.</P>
    <P>Another major initiative relates to the catering sector and the use of egg. Eggs have been associated with outbreaks of salmonella food poisoning. The salmonella strain primarily associated with poultry is salmonella enteritidis. There has been an aggressive salmonella control programme in table egg laying flocks in the Republic of Ireland for a lenghty period and I am advised by the FSAI that our flocks are virtually salmonella free. The flocks are monitored by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and flocks found to be positive with salmonella enteritidis are slaughtered.</P>
    <P>In 1998 there were three outbreaks of salmonella enteritidis all linked to eggs traced back to a Northern Ireland source. These outbreaks resulted in 88 people becoming ill, three of whom were hospitalised. In 1999 there were seven outbreaks of salmonella enteritidis in the Republic of Ireland, four of which were associated with eggs from a Northern Ireland source. The specific food contributing to the other three outbreaks was not established.</P>
    <P>According to the FSAI, all eggs are safe once cooked and the FSAI has issued advice to commercial catering companies, hospitals and other institutions about the risks associated with raw egg dishes such as tiramisu, baked Alaska, mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.</P>
    <P>The FSAI has collaborated with the Egg Association and Bord Bia in developing a quality assurance scheme that incorporates strict disease control and monitoring measures in flocks. Each individual egg is marked with the flock of origin and these flocks are all salmonella enteritidis free. The authority now recommends that caterers should use either pasteurised eggs or eggs sourced from proven salmonella controlled flocks such as those in the Bord Bia egg quality assurance scheme. In this context, there has been a reduction in the number of reported cases of food poisoning caused by salmonella nationally from 1,258 in 1998 to 956 in 1999. A combination of the availability of salmonella enteritidis free eggs from this quality assurance scheme and advice to all sectors of the industry about the risks associated with raw egg dishes where the source is not known should reduce the number of egg associated outbreaks of salmonella enteritidis.</P>
    <P>The FSAI has also had major initiatives focused at the control and prevention of e.coli 0157 in the food chain. This has involved working closely with the food sector in developing codes of best practice for reducing contamination of meat products during processing and the safety labelling of minced beef products with consumer instructions for the preparation and cooking of these foods. There was also a reduction in the reported incidence of e.coli 0157 infection from 76 in 1998 to 51 in 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> The FSAI has developed guidance notes to standardise the investigation of outbreaks and, while each health board co-ordinates the notification of outbreaks, members from other food agencies are called in to assist with tracing contaminated products back through the food chain. In addition, the FSAI has initiated a training programme on outbreak investigations and simulated outbreak exercises are used to develop expertise and team work in this area. They have also developed a surveillance system to collect details on all outbreaks that occur to ensure that lessons are learnt from the outbreaks. The system collects details on the germs involved, the implicated foods and the faulty hygiene practices that may have contributed to the outbreak, and the types of premises involved.</P>
    <P>The FSAI is now co-ordinating the work of the enforcement officers in the official agencies to ensure there are no gaps in the continuum of food safety controls from the farm to the point of sale. Over 1,800 people in the various front line agencies are working under contract to the FSAI as part of a multidisciplinary team to ensure food legislation is complied with and problems can be traced back through the food chain and appropriate corrective action taken.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that the FSAI not only has the capacity to tackle the problem of food poisoning but is actively involved in a number of initiatives which should help to minimise outbreaks in the future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that an outbreak of salmonella typhimurium DT104 has occurred within the past number of days in the North-Eastern Health Board region.</P>
    <P>There have been 34 confirmed cases, and ten people have been hospitalised to date. The North Eastern Health Board is co-ordinating an intensive investigation into the outbreak in conjunction with the FSAI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. A product recall of affected product was immediately arranged and is now complete. The North Eastern Health Board and the FSAI made available helplines to provide consumers and retailers with advice on control measures to be adopted.</P>

      <P>Directions on the recruitment and selection of staff to children's residential centres were issued by my Department in November 1994. Under these directions <Col N="802" /> employers must obtain Garda clearance on all staff being considered for appointment to a children's residential centre. In September 1995 these directions were extended to the recruitment of staff to any area of the health services where they would have substantial access to children and vulnerable individuals. The directions also stress that it is important that employers validate information supplied by candidates and verify references pro-actively.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, that the Garda clearance procedure also applies in respect of public service appointments and, on a pilot basis, to persons on a FÁS community employment project which involves regular unsupervised contact with children or other vulnerable persons.</P>
      <P>I also understand that in 1999 the Garda Commissioner commenced a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements. He established an internal working group to recommend improved clearance procedures which would allow the Garda Síochána to respond effectively to the increasing number of requests to extend the system. Arising from the recommendations of the working group, the Garda Commissioner has approved the establishment of an implementation group which will report on the practical and resource implications of establishing a new centralised unit to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>New national child protection guidelines Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children were published in September 1999 by my Department.

They state that all organisations providing services to children have an overall corporate duty and responsibility to safeguard children by, <i>inter alia</i>, adopting and consistently applying a safe and clearly defined method of recruiting and selecting staff and volunteers.</P>

      <P>Before taking up a nursing appointment it is necessary to be registered with An Bord Altranais. The board has statutory responsibility for the training and registration of nurses in this country and the recognition of qualifications obtained from abroad.</P>
      <P>A nurse from the Philippines applying for registration with An Bord Altranais must forward a completed application form and the appropriate fee to the board. The applicant must then arrange for a transcript of education and training, verification of registration/licence and references to be sent directly from source to the board. Applicants are then assessed on an individual basis and will be approved if the applicant meets the standards-criteria set down by the board.</P>
      <P>I understand that An Bord Altranais has been unable to process many of the applications on hand from nurses from the Philippines due to the extremely slow response of the Professional Registration Council in the Philippines to the board's requests for verification of applicants' education and training. However, the board states that decisions in relation to the requirements which must be fulfilled for registration have now been made on all the applications for which it has received the necessary documentation.</P>

      <P>In May 1999 I introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the scheme of thatching grants operated by my Department, which provides grants towards the cost of renewal or repair of thatched roofs. The basic maximum grant was increased from £2,400 to £3,000 and for houses on specified offshore islands from £3,600 to £4,500. Grants are payable to meet two thirds of the approved cost of the works, subject to the maximum limits.</P>
      <P>I also introduced a new measure to assist lower income households, for whom the cost of maintaining a thatched roof imposes a particular burden, whereby householders with medical cards are now eligible for thatching grants up to a maximum of £5,000, or £6,500 in the case of houses on the offshore islands. In addition, in such cases the grant may cover up to 80% of the approved cost of the works, subject to the maximum grant limits.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to further amend the terms of this scheme.</P>

Any person aggrieved by the order may, within three weeks of this publication, challenge the CPO by an application to the High Court.

      <P>The interest rate on local authority housing loans is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to mortgage rates prevailing in the financial market. The current variable rate is 4.25%. The current fixed interest rate available on local authority loans is 6.75% for a period of five years.</P>
      <P>The Government's recently published review of the Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to target support to home owners with high fixed interest rate local authority loans. This commitment relates to higher fixed interest rates on loans, advanced in the 1970s up to the mid 1980s, which reflected the cost of long-term funds available at that time. Borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free, since 1980, to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance in the private sector.

      <P>The national development plan includes a target of £100 million in private finance to support public investment in the area of water supply. In seeking to meet this target the Department has identified the sector involving the provision or upgrading of water supply and treatment facilities as being the most suitable for the use of private finance.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Clareville water treatment plant has been approved as a PPP project using the design, build, finance and operate model. This project forms part of an investment strategy, with a total investment of up to £100 million, which will significantly upgrade the water supply infrastructure in the Limerick region. The financial impact of using this model on Limerick Corporation is intended to be neutral in so far as capital spending is concerned.</P>
      <P>The expected benefits of carrying out this project using the PPP approach include better value for money, through the use of more innovative design and lower whole life costs, and faster implementation of the project in the context of the overall water strategy for the Limerick region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to addressing the problem of homelessness. The need for a comprehensive response to homelessness was acknowledged in the establishment of the cross-Department team on homelessness whose remit includes health, education, employment as well as accommodation needs. The team will present its report in the near future with recommendations on how the problem of homelessness should be addressed comprehensively.</P>
      <P>A special £5 million allocation over the two years, 2000 and 2001, was made in the recent budget for the provision of two high support hostels for homeless people suffering from drug and alcohol addictions and is being made available to Dublin Corporation to build or acquire and redevelop suitable premises for these purposes. This allocation will supplement the £4 million allocation in the public capital programme for the provision by local authorities of hostel accommodation this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is open to voluntary bodies to avail of funding under my Department's voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes to provide hostel and sheltered housing accommodation for homeless persons. My Department encourages voluntary bodies to avail of these schemes for the provision of voluntary housing accommodation and the financial provision for these schemes has been increased from £45 million in 1999 to £68 million for the year 2000. The upper thresholds for unit costs under these schemes have also been significantly increased.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are also empowered under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, to fund the provision of accommodation for homeless people and to make contributions to voluntary bodies towards the running costs of accommodation for homeless people operated by the voluntary bodies. My Department recoups 90% of local authorities expenditure on emergency accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
      <P>The local authority housing programme which also provides housing accommodation for homeless persons is being expanded to provide 22,000 housing starts over the next four years.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to note a continuing increase in the number of houses being registered. In 1998 a total of 23,296 houses were registered. This figure had increased to 26,111 by September 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>There is a range of accommodation available for homeless people and other groups, such as asylum seekers. Hostel accommodation is the main source of accommodation for homeless persons. The description &ldquo;hostel accommodation&rdquo; is a broad one and includes long-term, transitional or medium-term accommodation where people can stay for varying periods and over-night accommodation vacated every day, although in some cases the same persons might come back nightly.</P>
      <P>Information is not available in my Department on the number of people accommodated on a night by night basis. However, it is estimated that there are approximately 900 bed places available for homeless people in hostels in the Dublin city area and they are usually all occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the hostel accommodation which is operated by voluntary bodies has been newly built or redeveloped over the past ten years or so with the assistance of funding provided by my Department. The hostel accommodation operated directly by Dublin Corporation has either been provided in recent years, or in the case of <Col N="816" /> the older accommodation redeveloped, with capital funding from my Department. Apart from consisting of individual units of accommodation, these enable residents to remain on the premises during the day and, in some cases, provide meals and-or self-catering facilities and, in some cases, laundry facilities. I am satisfied that most of the accommodation available for homeless persons is of a high quality.</P>
    <P>In addition to the availability of hostel accommodation, bed and breakfast accommodation is also used to accommodate homeless people, where necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to emergency accommodation for other groups such as asylum seekers, the range of accommodation being availed of includes full board accommodation, emergency bed and breakfast accommodation and private rented accommodation. The sourcing of such accommodation is a matter for the directorate of asylum seeker services in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>The maximum mortgage loan available for house purchase to a one income family on the average industrial wage is, in the first instance, a matter for the lending institutions.</P>
      <P>A one income family on the industrial wage would qualify for the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. The income threshold of a single income household is that the gross income in the previous tax year must not exceed £20,000. There is no maximum loan limit set for the affordable housing scheme. However, the maximum loan cannot exceed 95% of the sale price of the house and account has to be taken of the purchaser's ability to repay by reference to net income of the household. In the case of the shared ownership scheme, a borrower must purchase at least 40% of the value of the house and rent the remaining share, 60% or less, from the local authority.</P>
      <P>Households with a gross income of £16,000 or less in the preceding tax year qualify for an annual subsidy towards their mortgage repayments under the affordable housing scheme and towards the rent payable under the shared ownership scheme.</P>
      <P>In general, house prices under the affordable and shared ownership schemes currently range from £70,000 to approximately £105,000.</P>

      <P>The Government approved a range of measures in <i>Action on House Prices</i> (April 1998) and <i>Action on the Housing Market </i>(March 1999) to accelerate the provision of additional housing supply and bring balance to the housing market. Copies of these documents are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The most recent comprehensive assessment of local authority housing needs was carried out in March 1999 and the results were published in the September quarter 1999 housing statistics Bulletin. In response to increased need, the local authority housing programme has been significantly expanded to provide 22,000 additional local authority house starts over a four-year multi-annual programme, 2000-2003. The multi-annual nature of the programme will enable the more effective planning and implementation of local authority housing delivery. Significantly increased levels of funding assistance are being provided to voluntary housing bodies under the voluntary housing schemes, including for the first time additional assistance towards site acquisition costs. A voluntary and co-operative housing unit has been established in my Department which will be responsible for developing the voluntary and co-operative housing sector with a view to increasing output to a target of over 4,000 units per year. I also established a housing supply unit in my Department to ensure urgent and effective delivery of the housing supply measures and to identify any additional measures that might be put in place to further increase housing supply. The £6 billion investment in social and affordable housing in the national development plan will ensure that the housing needs of over 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the plan period.</P>
      <P>Most recently, the Government agreed a wide range of housing commitments with the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 to 249, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The affordable housing scheme involves the provision by local authorities of additional new <Col N="821" /> houses specifically for low income house purchasers on land provided by the local authorities. Housing authorities were requested in April last to assess the extent to which the new affordable housing scheme could appropriately be used in their areas and to formulate proposals for specific developments which should be brought to construction at the earliest possible date. The development of suitable sites, including, where necessary, the acquisition of land, and the planning and construction of houses does, of necessity, require some time to arrange. Local authorities may obtain funding for land acquisition from the housing finance agency. The cost of loan charges relating to land acquired by a local authority to provide houses under the local authority affordable housing scheme will be met by my Department, for a maximum period of three years or until the houses are constructed and sold, whichever is the lesser. Kildare County Council has not sought funding from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of land acquisition for affordable housing so the payment of the loan charges in their case has not as yet arisen. In October 1999 Kildare County Council appointed a project officer to co-ordinate the provision of affordable housing throughout the county.</P>
    <P>I understand that Naas UDC is currently in the process of finalising plans for a 115 unit scheme at Carragh Road, Naas. Of these, 52 units will be made available under the affordable housing scheme and 60 will be for social housing. The final three units will be made available to disabled persons under the local authority programme. This scheme is due to commence in July of this year.</P>
    <P>The county council is also at various stages of negotiations with developers with a view to providing affordable housing schemes at a number of locations, including Maynooth. At present I understand that Kildare County Council has no immediate plans for affordable housing in Kilcock.</P>

      <P>Section 32 (1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, provides that a person shall not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. This general duty of care applies, <i>inter alia</i>, to the owner of an end-of-life vehicle, ELV.</P>
      <P>Section 71 of the 1996 Act specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land, and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with abandoned vehicles. ELVs may be transferred to one of a number of facilities that have been permitted under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, to undertake the dismantling and recovery of ELVs.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are required under the 1996 Act to provide or arrange for the provision of such facilities as appear to be necessary and reasonable, at which vehicles may be discarded.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the discussions between the Local Government Management Services Board, representing local authority management, and the unions representing local authority administrative and technical staff on management proposals for strengthening local authority management and staffing structures, the implementation of which is one element in the Government's programme for renewing the local government system.</P>
      <P>After almost three years of negotiations, final management proposals for the new structures, were formally put to the staff side on 19 October 1999. Following ballots, the proposals were accepted by IMPACT, representing the clerical-administrative side but rejected by SIPTU, representing the engineering side, who referred the matter to the Labour Relations Commission, LRC. At a meeting involving all the parties in the LRC on 8 February 2000, SIPTU was requested by the LRC to put its case in writing. It has done so in the past few days and management will now be invited to respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>The legislative provisions governing the rates of payment of child benefit, CB, including the entitlements in respect of twins and multiple births of three or more children, are provided for in the Social Welfare Acts. The position in relation to this issue is that, prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, CB was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.  In the case of twins, CB was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of 4 and 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced two key additional measures in the Social Welfare Act, 1998. First, the rate of CB payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal CB rate. Prior to the election, we promised to increase child benefit for twins by 50% and we carried out this commitment in full <Col N="825" /> in our first budget. Second, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to also include families with multiple births of three or more children. These measures took effect in September 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million. In the interim, I have also provided for very substantial additional investments in the CB scheme. The 1999 budget provided for an additional full-year investment in the scheme of over £40 million, while the recent budget provides for a full-year investment of almost £106 million. From September of this year, the basic CB monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of the first two children and £56.00 in respect of the third and subsequent children. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including, of course, families with twins and represent, in my view, the most effective use of the available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided last year to extend the term of the Department's contract with An Post for the delivery of social welfare payments for an additional period of <Col N="826" /> three years. Following this decision, certain legal issues regarding the extension of the contract have been raised with the EU Commission by a third party which feels aggrieved by the Government's decision. In accordance with its usual practice in these matters, the Commission referred these complaints to my Department for its observations.</P>
      <P>Responses to the complaints have been sent to the Commission. The Commission is currently examining the arguments advanced by the complainant and the observations supplied by my Department. These matters are being processed by the Commission in accordance with the normal procedures which apply in matters of this nature and I am confident the Government decision will stand up to this scrutiny. The question of pressure or coercion forming part of this process does not arise.</P>
      <P>The Government intends to comply fully with its EU obligations in this matter, once they have been definitively established.</P>
      <P>The necessity to address and resolve the issues raised with the EU Commission has delayed the completion of a new three year contract with An Post. In the meantime, recognising that the payment delivery service which An Post provides to my Department's customers must continue without interruption, my Department and An Post have agreed that the company will continue to provide these services on an interim basis. The Commission has been notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate my own and the Government's commitment to maintain a network of post offices. Our policy in this regard has been clearly stated by my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the living alone allowance of £6 per week is to recognise the extra cost of living alone. It is payable as an addition to weekly social welfare pensions to people aged 66 years of age or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments, and who reside alone.</P>
      <P>The allowance is an integral part of the Irish pension system and is designed to cover a specific contingency. As such, it has no applicability<i> vis-à-vis</i> pension payments made under the social security regimes of other EU member states or countries with which Ireland has bilateral agreements. This is fully in accordance with the EU regulations which allow all member states to decide which benefits are granted and under what conditions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been receiving long-term unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £137.90, including a fuel allowance of £8.00. He claimed disability benefit from 5 January 2000 to 27 January 2000 after which date he was certified fit to resume work. He then resumed claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The rate of disability benefit payable was £74.20. However he continued to receive unemployment assistance up to 18 January, and, consequently, there was an over-payment for the period between 5 January and 18 January. This over-payment is not being recovered. Payment of disability benefit was made from 19 January to 27 January 2000 at the rate of £74.20 per week.</P>
      <P>In addition, he qualified for an additional payment of supplementary welfare allowance in the amount of £29.80 for the period 19 January to 27 January. That amount was subsequently recovered from him in error but arrangements have since been made to have it refunded to him.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997, I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under it. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and, accordingly, a sum of £5 million has been provided for this scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50% to 90% of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment, with the exclusion of the conventional intruder alarm. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90% of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. Priority in allocating the available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in 1998, a voluntary organisation applied for funding on behalf of some 37 individuals, including the person referred to in the Deputy's question. The group in question received funding of £6,286 in that year to assist the individuals indicated in their application and I understand that the individual indicated in the Deputy's question received some assistance that year. While the group made a further application in 1999 to the Department it did not include an application on behalf of the individual indicated.</P>
      <P>I propose to advertise this year's scheme in both the national and provincial press by mid-March, by which time any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may submit applications for funding. If a further application for funding on behalf of the person concerned is received under this year's scheme it will be given full consideration taking into account the level of assistance sought and the overall demands to be met under the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons cut off unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit from June 1999 to January 2000 on a monthly, county to county basis due to his Department claiming they are not genuinely seeking work; the number of these cases appealed; and the number successful and disallowed.</Quest>

      <P>To be entitled to an unemployment payment a person must satisfy the statutory conditions of being capable of, being available for and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment. Where a deciding officer decides, following an interview with the person, that she or he does not fulfil the conditions the claim is formally disallowed.</P>
      <P>In all, in the period from June 1999 to January 2000, 8,014 claims were disallowed on the grounds that the person in question failed to satisfy the statutory conditions of genuinely seeking suitable employment or of being available for employment. Details for each category and for each month are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Figures are not maintained on a county by county basis.</P>
      <P>Apart from those whose claims were disallowed for failure to fulfil the statutory conditions substantial numbers of persons withdrew their claims or ceased claiming following interview by my Department. These are not included in the figures quoted. If a person is dissatisfied with the deciding officer's decision she or he has a right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>During the period in question, 2,511 appeals relating to unemployment payments were received in that office. Of these 1,399 related to unemployment assistance and 1,112 to unemployment benefit. These figures include persons disallowed for reasons other than the &ldquo;not genuinely seeking&rdquo; and &ldquo;not available&rdquo; conditions.</P>
      <P>Of the unemployment payment appeals dealt with by the appeals office during the period in question, 26.6% were favourable to the appellant and 73.4% were not successful.</P>

    <P>I am also providing that CDA increases will continue to be paid at the full rate until the income of the spouse exceeds £135.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that similar tapering arrangements are being introduced from April 2000 in respect of claimants of retirement pension and invalidity pension. As regards other social welfare payments, tapering arrangements already exist in the case of all other relevant schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> These measures will have a positive effect on households where the spouse of an OAP claimant wishes to avail of employment opportunities. From May 2000, for instance, in the case of a household comprising an OAP claimant, a spouse aged under 66 and two dependent children, and where the spouse has income of £80 per week, the household income will increase by £67 per week as a result of the measures I am introducing. If the couple had no child dependants, the household income would increase by £51.80 for the same earnings.</P>

      <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is in receipt of an annual grant of £1 million from my Department. The purpose of the grant is primarily to support their charitable work over the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>Christmas time has traditionally been the time of greatest demand for the society's services as those affected by poverty, unemployment and disadvantage feel the effects of their situation most acutely at this time of year.</P>
      <P>The allocation made to the society in 1999 included an additional once-off grant of £100,000 towards the cost of developing a co-ordinated administration and development structure for the society.</P>
      <P>Local conferences of St. Vincent de Paul have also made funding applications over the years under the various once-off grant schemes operated by my Department. Information relating to the total amount of once-off grants approved last year in respect of these conferences is not currently available.</P>

      <P>Individualisation of the social welfare system was considered in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting, and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, which was published in August last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group noted that individualisation already exists to a certain extent, firstly, in the social insurance system to the extent that those who meet the contribution conditions receive a payment in their own right; and also in the old age <Col N="835" /> non-contributory pension arrangements whereby in the case of a couple, each over age 66, there is a joint means test and payment is then on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>The group considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individuals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements. Much has already been achieved in this area over the last 12 years with coverage being extended to the self employed &ndash; 1988 &ndash; part-time workers &ndash; 1991 &ndash; and new civil-public servants &ndash; 1995. In addition, measures were introduced in 1994 to protect the insurance records of those who take time out from the paid workforce for caring duties.</P>
    <P>Where the spouse or cohabiting partner of a social welfare recipient does not qualify for a payment in his or her own right he or she is catered for through the payment of a qualified adult allowance  &ndash; QAA. In principle, the QAA rate is set at less than 100% of the personal rate on the basis that there are economies of scale where two people live together in the same household, and that account should be taken of these economies where the second person does not have a direct entitlement to a social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>The working group also considered administrative individualisation which, for example, would allow for the payment of the QAA direct to the person concerned. There was general agreement towards extending the administrative arrangements in the area of separate payments.</P>
    <P>The question of making such separate payments in all cases involves some complex social issues which need to be considered carefully. It also raises questions about the position of the qualified adult when the social welfare payment is no longer payable, for example, when the recipient takes up employment. In addition there would be some administrative and cost implications.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is to develop proposals to progress the individualisation of social welfare payments in the context of the continuation of joint assessment of means. In this regard working groups will be established under the programme</P>
    <P>to produce proposals to progress the implementation of administrative individualisation within the social welfare system and to produce proposals for the development of a fully inclusive social insurance model which would facilitate combining work and family responsibilities in the context of changing working and social patterns.</P>

      <Quest>the best estimate of the extent of child poverty; his views on whether one of the best ways to tackle this effectively is through child benefit; and the reason there have not been major improvements in the level of child benefit in recent years.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest ESRI figures from the living in Ireland survey show that the percentage of children experiencing consistent poverty fell from 18-23% in 1994 to 15-17% in 1997, while the numbers living in households below the 50% relative income line fell from 29% in 1994 to 24% in 1997. This reduction in child poverty is largely attributable to falling unemployment levels which have enabled many families to release themselves from dependency on social welfare payments and improve their incomes. Under this Government, there have been further record increases in employment. The latest unemployment rate, at January 2000, is 4.9%.</P>
      <P>In June 1999, the Government asked the national anti-poverty strategy inter-departmental policy committee to draw up new targets to reflect the changing social and economic environment, including, for example, a child poverty target. This issue is being pursued further in the context of the proposed new social partnership agreement.</P>
      <P>The view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty is widely acknowledged and is fully shared by the Government. As a universal payment, which is not taxable and which is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards etc, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or to improving wages. The value of the scheme is reflected in the very substantial investment which the Government has made in the scheme in recent budgets.</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget, for instance, provided for a full-year investment of over £40 million in the scheme, while the recent 2000 budget provides for a further full-year investment of almost £106 million. From September of this year, the basic CB monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of each of the first two children and £56.00 in respect of the third and subsequent children.</P>

      <P>The Government has approved the Arts Council Arts Plan, 1999-2001. The implementation of the plan is a matter for the Arts Council which is an independent autonomous body under the Arts Acts. The Deputy will be aware that in 1998 I commissioned an independent review of the Arts Council first arts plan which was in its final year and this review informed the development by the council of the current plan. I will give consideration to a review of the Arts Plan, 1999-2001, at the appropriate time.      </P>

      <P>In announcing last October my intention to initiate a radical review of arts legislation to get under way this year, I intimated that this review must be rooted in the recognition of the arts as an important and grow<Col N="839" /> ing contributor to the economy and the general quality of life.</P>
      <P>The arts environment has changed dramatically since the Arts Acts of 1951 and 1973 were enacted. This of itself bespeaks the need for a fundamental review of structures as does the declared intention to the Arts Council to reposition itself as a development agency for the arts. Accordingly, the review will incorporate an examination of the current policy and executive structures and their effectiveness. Work on scoping the agenda for the review and the manner for which it is to be conducted is already under way in my Department. The project will involve consultation with all the partners involved in development and support of the arts including the Arts Council, the arts sector and individual artists, State agencies and local authorities and the general public. I will draw on the outcome of this comprehensive review when formulating my proposals for amending arts legislation which I would hope to be in a position to bring to Cabinet by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware it is not the practice of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to comment on individual Garda investigations save in the most exceptional of circumstances. I should also point out to the Deputy that I have no responsibility for the prosecution of offences. Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is independent in operational matters and Garda investigations are not carried out under the aegis of my Department or any other Department of State.</P>
      <P>All I propose to say in this case is that the matter has been the subject of a detailed Garda investigation and that an individual is facing a number of charges. As the case is currently before the courts the Deputy will understand that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>

      <P>With regard to anti-theft security in cars, the national crime prevention office and the stolen vehicle recovery unit, both based at Garda headquarters, Harcourt Square, maintain regular contact with motor distributors and retailers. I understand that, in accordance with recent EU legislation, all new vehicles sold in Ireland are fitted with an immobiliser as standard. I am also informed that there is a wide range of anti-theft devices on the market.

      <P>I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, by way of reply to parliamentary questions, the position regarding ground rents.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the position is that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents)(No.2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwelling houses. Part III of the (No.2) Act provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwelling houses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 15 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is also no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the (No. 2) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill, introduced as a Private Members' Bill in 1997, raised constitutional, technical and practical difficulties of a kind which cannot be easily overcome. If and when those difficulties can be met in a way that would substantially improve on the already good and reasonable sys<Col N="850" /> tem that exists for the purchase of ground rent, the necessary legislative details will be announced in the normal way.</P>

      <P>My Department has been allocated £250 million to develop child care provision over the next seven years under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The funding will facilitate my Department's child care measure, details of which I announced in December 1999. The criteria and the eligibility requirements for these measures are being developed at present and it is intended to promote some of the initiatives in the coming weeks, at which stage detailed information leaflets and application forms will be available from the equal opportunities child care section of my Department.</P>
      <P>The initiatives that will be funded by my Department include the following measures: expansion of the equal opportunities child care programme combining the following aspects, capital grants to community based-not for profit organisations to support the establishment, upgrading and enhancement of child care facilities; staffing grants to assist community based-not for profit projects to fund the salary costs of child care workers; training supports designed to improve and expand the provision of child care training; and support for innovative projects in the child care area.</P>
      <P>Funding will also be provided towards the development of local child care network initiatives to provide mutual support for providers and facilitate the dissemination of information and learning materials, thereby assisting the provision of a high quality service to parents and children.</P>
      <P>A further element will be the provision of a new capital grant scheme for self-employed child care providers, providing up to 20 child care places, to assist in establishing and upgrading their facilities thus helping them to provide a better quality environment for children under their care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also been given the responsibility to co-ordinate child care in the context of the national development plan. My Department has established and is chairing a national co-ordinating child care committee which will oversee the development of a child care infrastructure in a co-ordinated manner throughout the country. In addition, a synergies group has been established which focuses on co-operation and co-ordinating between Departments and State agencies which have a role in child care funding or training. County child care committees will also be established to advance <Col N="851" /> the provision of child care facilities on a county basis.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the French and German languages have been included for European language training purposes on the curriculum for student gardaí since 1993 to assist them in dealing with people who speak these languages. The language training provided at the Garda college also requires that students already have the basis of the language being taught, that is, leaving certificate level. When European languages were added to the student Garda curriculum in 1993, approximately 75% of second-level school leavers had studied French to leaving certificate level and 20% had studied German to the same level. These percentages were also reflected in the students joining the Garda Síochána. The number of students commencing Garda training with a background in Spanish was, and still is, negligible. However, to redress this imbalance, classes are provided by the Civil Service language training centre for up to 60 gardaí a year in European languages, including Spanish, Italian and Russian. Up to 15 gardaí per year undergo the Spanish classes.</P>
      <P>The recently approved review of student Garda education training programme report acknowledges that consideration should be given in the future to extending the European language programme at the Garda college to include Spanish and Italian. This will become more feasible if a higher percentage of students who commence training have a foundation in these languages.</P>

      <P>Arrangements have been in place since 1994 whereby the Garda Síochána carries out clearance checks in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals. These arrangements, which were introduced by my predecessor at that time at the request of the Department of Health and Children in response to allegations of abuse of children in residential child care centres, are implemented by the Garda Síochána in strict adherence to legal advices received in the matter from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> The clearance procedure requires that a prospective employee sign a consent form which the hospital or health board forwards to the Garda authorities.

      <P>While the use of illicit drugs is a nationwide problem, the local drugs task forces were set up in the areas experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse, particularly in relation to heroin.</P>
      <P>Understandably, the focus over the past number of years has been on tackling the heroin problem, in view of its public health implications and close association with crime. However, funding is also available to a range of State agencies, including the health boards, to respond to the drug problem outside the task force areas. This funding is available to agencies not only to deliver their own plans, but also to enable them to support community and voluntary groups in responding to the problem in their areas.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Eastern Health Board to contact the group referred to in the Deputy's question about how it might contribute to the board's anti-drug strategy. Meanwhile, I have also initiated an overall review of the national drugs strategy, with a view to considering necessary changes to current strategy before year end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 to 314, inclusive, and No. 316  together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before addressing the issues raised by the Deputy, I feel it would be helpful to briefly set out some background information. Community schools are established under a deed of trust and managed by an 11-member board of management separate from my Department. The board comprises three representatives of the religious communities, three representatives of the vocational education committee, two parent and two teacher representatives. The principal teacher of the school is a non-voting member of the board of management. My Department is not represented on the board. Each board is responsible for the governance and direction of the school and for the procedures in place to inform board members concerning the affairs of the school. My Department provides guidance to boards in relation to school management generally and it also supports initiatives taken by the representative management body for boards &ndash; the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools &ndash; in this regard so as to ensure that best practice obtains. <Col N="860" /> Where internal board difficulties arise, these fall to be dealt with by the board in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Over recent years there has been a number of complaints and allegations concerning Carndonagh community school. These have centred in the main upon issues of financial accountability and the accuracy of returns of pupil enrolments submitted to my Department.</P>
    <P>More recently, the Teachers Union of Ireland and the board of management of the school agreed with my Department that a facilitation-mediation process should be put in place as a means of making progress in relation to the matters in contention in the school. Both parties agreed to the appointment of a facilitator of considerable professional standing and reputation to undertake this task.</P>
    <P>In his report the facilitator sought, as far as possible, to deal with issues of concern and grievance. In his conclusions the facilitator noted that full audits of the school by the Department's internal audit unit, as well as visits to the school by officials of the Department in relation to administrative and financial matters which followed the complaint, did not disclose any impropriety or inappropriate personal gain on anybody's part nor were there any specific allegations in that regard. In addition, although given the opportunity to do so, nobody has produced any evidence of misappropriation or other such offence. In this regard I should stress that it is my Department's approach that if evidence that a breach of criminal law took place is produced such evidence will be placed in the hands of the Garda. Similarly, if evidence is provided that there was impropriety in respect of taxation or related issues, our approach will be to place the matter in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In relation to specific matters raised by the Deputy the position is as follows. My Department is prepared to make enrolment information for the period referred to by the Deputy available to the board of management.</P>
    <P>My Department's auditors, as part of its audit of Carndonagh community school, examined and evaluated the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control systems in place in relation to the operation of the tuck shop-canteen area. The audit objectives were achieved and the findings and recommendations were outlined in detail in the audit reports. These reports were issued to the board of management and the principal. The recommendations contained therein have been accepted by the board.</P>
    <P>Guidance is given to schools in the administrative and financial guidelines issued by my Department to all community and comprehensive schools. These guidelines include guidance in relation to borrowing. A copy of the guidelines can be made available to the Deputy if he so wishes. It is accepted by the board that there were shortcomings in the observation of these guidelines. However, the board now recognises its responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> My Department's auditors also identified deficiencies in payroll procedures which included the use of bank drafts. While the Department considered that this practice was unsatisfactory, there was not at that time any specific prohibition on the use of bank drafts. This situation has now been addressed under the revised administrative and financial guidelines.</P>
    <P>Certain shortcomings were identified in the deduction of PAYE and PRSI from employees' pay in the Department's audit report. Small errors of both under and over deduction were identified. On foot of this information the Department sanctioned the appointment of an independent accountant to examine the matter in greater detail. He confirmed the initial findings and established the definitive position in regard to each employee. He also made recommendations to the board designed to regularise deductions and to settle outstanding matters with the Revenue Commissioners. The board accepted these recommendations and acted accordingly.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Department's audit it was identified that the school held an account in Derry. It was explained that this account was used for the purpose of making deposits of sterling coin which would not be accepted by local banks and that the account was also used to finance purchases in Northern Ireland for the school. This account has since been closed as part of a recommended restructuring of bank accounts following audit.</P>
    <P>In 1997, with the approval of the leaving certificate vocational programme office, the school was permitted to place all year one leaving certificate pupils, 268 pupils, through the programme on the basis that the cross curricular approach would benefit all pupils and would ease timetabling. However, a large number of these pupils did not meet the programme eligibility criteria and were not included by the school in its October return for funding and teacher allocation purposes. The numbers returned by the school in this respect were 113 in year one in 1997 and 103 in year two in 1998 and funding was provided on this basis.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to pupil numbers is that in March 1994 the principal notified the Department that, owing to inadequate checking, the return of pupils for that year was overstated by 35. Subsequently the Department was informed by three members of the board of management that pupil returns had been overstated for the years 1991-92 to 1994-95 inclusive. Lists of pupils were produced which indicated that numbers were overstated as follows: 1991-92, 49; 1992-93, 57; 1993-94, 115; and 1994-95, 71.</P>
    <P>The Department's capacity to arrive at a definitive conclusion in relation to the issue of overstatement was hampered by the fact that the school did not fully comply with procedures for maintaining roll books prior to 1994-95. The Department recalled the school rolls for that year and compared them with pupil returns for 1994-95. This disclosed a discrepancy of two between the rolls and the returns for that year, as cor<Col N="862" /> rected by the principal following his notification of the issue to the Department. This exercise also led the Department to conclude that listings supplied by the three board members could not be relied upon as accurate indicators of school numbers.</P>
    <P>The Department also crosschecked pupil returns by the school with the listing of pupils who sat the junior certificate and leaving certificate examination for each of the years 1990-91 to 1993-94. During a visit to the school an official sought explanations for listings of pupils who were scheduled to sit examinations but who did not do so and he sought the school's opinion on the possible reason for an exceptional drop out rate. A listing of a total of 85 pupils who enrolled for the first year of the senior cycle in September 1993 but who did not return for the second year in 1994 was identified and the school's views on the possible reasons for it were sought. Having heard the views of the principal, the official concluded that, in the absence of comprehensive school pupil attendance records, there was no reliable way of establishing what the exact position in relation to student numbers was prior to 1994-95. The principal conceded that he could not stand over some of the names on the school records for the period.</P>
    <P>The Department recognises that any overstatement of pupil numbers has resource implications arising from teaching posts and capitation. In regard to teaching and promotional posts the position is that teacher allocation for a second level school for a particular school year consists of approved ex-quota posts together with the allocation warranted by the enrolment in the school at the end of the preceding September on the basis of the current pupil teacher ratio. Prior to the implementation of the terms of the PCW agreement on teachers pay and conditions, the number and level of posts of responsibility were decided by the points rating of the school as determined by the number and ages of the pupils. Comprehensive and community school budgets are designed to cover normal school running costs apart from salaries of teachers and major capital expenditure which are paid directly by the Department. The level of the approved budget is decided by the Department based on factors which include enrolments.</P>
    <P>Since the school year 1994-95 proper roll keeping procedures have been in place in Carndonagh community school. The facilitator considered this issue in the course of his report and concluded as follows:</P>
    <P>An investigation by the official of the Department into the matter of pupil numbers established that these had been overstated. It was noted that the principal could not stand over some of the pupil details returned to the Department. There was no evidence, however, to suggest that the over statement was engineered to secure additional financial or teaching resources from the Department or for personal gain. Having examined the pupil records then <Col N="863" /> being kept, the official was satisfied that proper pupil recording procedures had been put in place and that there would not be a recurrence of the problem. The matter should be allowed to rest there.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a teacher, suspended by the board of management of Carndonagh community school in October 1998, was not afforded the right of natural justice to put his case to the board; and if he will establish an independent inquiry into the history, reason and manner by which this teacher was suspended.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The teacher referred to by the Deputy was suspended by the board of management in October 1998 because of alleged misconduct relating to a refusal to teach certain classes for which he was timetabled. I understand that, prior to the suspension decision being taken, the teacher was invited to meet with the board and that he left the meeting in question &ldquo;in protest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The management of staff in any school is primarily the function of the board of that school and it is inappropriate for the Minister for Education and Science to become involved in such matters, except where this is specifically provided for in legislation. In the present case I have no statutory power to intervene in this matter and in particular I have no power to establish and conduct an inquiry of the kind proposed by the Deputy. I am advised, therefore, that I have no capacity to require the parties in the present case to engage with any inquiry which I may establish. In the absence of statutory powers any attempt on my part to try to require the parties to co-operate is likely to be met with a legal challenge on the grounds that I was acting <i>ultra vires</i>.</P>
      <P>While I do not have statutory powers and in general I am of the view that matters relating to the management and discipline of staff is exclusively a concern of the board of management, I am prepared in the circumstances of this case to appoint a person to carry out an inquiry into the alleged misconduct of the teacher concerned. For the reasons I outlined above any such inquiry could be held only with the agreement of all the parties and even then it would not be possible for such an inquiry to take evidence on oath or to compel any person to give evidence. The teacher concerned has been advised of my position and I am awaiting his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 and 342 together.</P>
      <P>The revised programme for pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994. The programme is funded by the Department of Health and Children and is fully operational since 1998. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. While undertaking the diploma programme, the students' fees are paid by the relevant health agency and they receive an annual non means-tested maintenance grant and other supports.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children consulted with a number of colleges in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes, which would be open both to nurses graduating under the revised programme and to nurses who graduated under the traditional model of education and training. These programmes were intended to offer post-registration qualifications on a part-time basis. A number of part-time degree programmes have been introduced on a self-financing basis and I understand that it is open to nurses who are employed by health agencies to apply to their employers for financial support towards the cost of undertaking such courses. Part-time courses do not come within the scope of the free fees initiative. I would point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate, under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>
      <P>The National University of Ireland, Galway, has introduced a one year full-time nursing degree programme for students who have completed the three year nursing diploma programme. As the Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children has stated that his Department is not in a position to meet the fees of students undertaking this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This degree course has not been included within the scope of my Department's free fees initiative. As this matter is at issue in the case of Sarena Tansey and Others <i>v. </i>the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Health and Children, the Western Health Board, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not consider it <Col N="865" /> appropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I would, however, refer to the recommendation of the Commission on Nursing that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses be based on a four year degree programme, the third year of which will be a 12 month continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. The commission further recommended that no third level institution should introduce a pre-registration nursing degree programme before the start of 2002-03 academic year. The nursing education forum has been established to prepare a strategy for the implementation of the new four year pre-registration nursing degree programme for the intake of nursing students in 2002.</P>

      <P>The following actions have been taken by my Department in relation to radon levels in schools: following indications of a problem with radon the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was commissioned to carry out a survey of radon levels in all primary and post-primary schools through out the country; all schools received information on radon and are being kept informed of new developments; the results of the first phase of the three year national survey relating to 685 schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow were issued to the schools concerned.</P>
      <P>The first survey indicated none of the rooms tested in 510 schools had a radon concentration above the reference level set of 200 (Bq/m3) above which remedial action is advised. Of the remaining 175 schools the RPII advised that 13 schools showing the highest level of radon require attention as soon as possible. My Department has appointed a consultant to undertake this work. Five schools have been inspected by the consultant who is preparing a mitigation programme for each. This is expected to be ready shortly. The remaining eight schools will be inspected by the consultant in early March.</P>
      <P>Remediation programmes for the remaining less affected schools will be drawn up following the appointment in the near future of a expert consultant who will advise on mitigation in these schools.</P>
      <P>The full cost of the entire mitigation programme will be borne by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>My Department's first priority has been to ensure that all schools have access to a remedial teacher service. This was achieved from September 1999 when the service was extended to every primary school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios may also seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants a service.</P>
      <P>The special education review committee recommended that the general criteria for establishing remedial need should relate to pupils identified as being below the tenth percentile on standardised tests in basic literacy and numeracy. The committee also recommended that the caseload of a remedial teacher catering for a single school should be 40 pupils. Where the post serves a cluster of schools, the committee recommended that the caseload be reduced by two for each school which is additional to the base school, subject to a maximum reduction of eight pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In extending the service to all schools, my Department sought to deploy the available resources in a manner which reflected the approach recommended by the special education committee. In some situations, including the case to which the Deputy refers, the small size of the schools involved and their geographical locations required that posts be deployed on a shared basis. In all such instances, every effort was made to <Col N="867" /> structure the clusters in a manner which minimised travelling times between schools.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools to which he refers will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to further improve existing services.</P>

      <P>The Government, in June 1997, decided to appoint a body under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, to advise the Higher Education Authority on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university under sections 12 and 13, the Dublin Institute of Technology should be established as a university.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group, chaired by Dr. Dermot Nally, was published in November 1998. The review group recommended that, while there should not be immediate university status for the Dublin Institute of Technology, it might become a university within a three to five year period subject to it meeting a number of criteria set out in its report. Following detailed consideration and analysis of the advice prepared by the review group the Higher Education Authority published its recommendations in March 1999.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority recommended against the immediate establishment of Dublin Institute of Technology as a university and indicated that a further statutory review of the Institute in line with section 9 of the Universities Act would be necessary for the Dublin Institute of Technology to be established as a university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a further statutory review under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, can only arise should the Dublin Institute of Tech<Col N="870" /> nology, at some future date, apply for establishment as a university and should the Government decide that the application be considered.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it was announced some months ago that, with effect from the beginning of the current school year, all second level schools in the free education scheme would have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> The actual entitlement of an individual school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more pupils qualify for the allocation of a full post while schools with enrolments below 600 qualify for the allocation of 0.5 of a post.</P>
    <P>In the vocational sector the teacher allocation is generally determined on a VEC scheme basis rather than on an individual school basis. In the case of County Meath VEC, the teacher allocation for the current school year includes an increased allocation in respect of remedial teaching compared to that allocated last year.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the chief executive officer, with the agreement of the VEC, to allocate teaching resources to individual schools in the scheme from within the overall approved allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of their pre-service training, all teachers undergo curriculum courses on the teaching of literacy and numeracy to pupils of different abilities. Class teachers have the competence and the responsibility to match their teaching to the needs and abilities of their pupils, including pupils with learning difficulties in the area of literacy and numeracy.</P>
      <P>The ultimate responsibility for pupils with learning difficulties lies with the class teacher even where a special support teacher is in place to give the pupils additional help. It would be incorrect to suggest that the qualified class teacher would not already have the skills and competencies to work with pupils with learning difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Learning support-remedial teachers have access to additional training because of their dedicated role in supporting numbers of pupils with learning difficulties. My Department arranges for a number of such teachers to attend special courses at six colleges each year. The courses are geographically spread, two in Dublin and one each in Sligo, Galway, Limerick and <Col N="873" /> Cork. The number of graduates from these courses over the two years 1998 and 1999 was 148 and 158 respectively; for the year 1999-00, 172 applicants were given places on the courses.</P>
    <P>The staff in these colleges have other responsibilities in teacher training besides those specifically associated with the training of learning support teachers. It is considered that, having regard to the range of courses which these colleges are required to provide and the level of expertise required in this area, the present geographical spread of courses represents the most suitable and feasible arrangement that can be made.</P>
    <P>Many shorter inservice courses for learning support-remedial teachers are financially supported by my Department. These are provided mainly through the network of education centres, teachers organisations and the programme of summer courses for teachers. Further in-service will be provided to meet evolving requirements of these teachers. The intention would be to involve the education centre at Enniscorthy, as well as other education centres, to the greatest extent possible in any developments there will be.</P>

      <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, became effective on 3 December 1998. Under the terms of the Act a teacher who is the natural or adoptive parent of a child is entitled to parental leave for a period of 14 working weeks.</P>
      <P>Following discussions between representatives of the relevant management organisations, teacher unions and my Department it was agreed that an eligible second level teacher could take parental leave as follows:</P>
      <P>as one continuous period of 14 weeks, or in two separate periods of seven weeks, or in a maximum of three separate periods with one of the periods being a minimum of two weeks and a second being a minimum period of four weeks.</P>
      <P>In exceptional circumstances a teacher may avail of parental leave where a child has particular medical problems which require the attendance of a parent with the child at a hospital or clinic on a regular basis. In such cases certification from the hospital or clinic in respect of the absence must be submitted to the managerial authority.</P>

      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was introduced in 33 urban and 123 rural schools in 1996 to test models of intervention, which would offset the effects of educational disadvantage, over a five-year period.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, was commissioned to evaluate the pilot project and carried out a programme of testing in English and mathematics in third and sixth class in the project schools in 1996 to establish baseline data against which future attainment test results will be compared. It is proposed to assess pupils' literacy and numeracy attainment again in May 2000 and the initial impact of the initiative on pupil achievement will be measured in this context. Any extension of the project's provisions to further schools will be considered in light of the final evaluation report.</P>
      <P>On 15 December 1999 the Taoiseach launched The New Deal &ndash; A Plan for Educational Opportunity. This involves a three-year programme and the allocation of £194 million to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. The initial step in implementing the programme will involve a survey of all primary schools during the current school term to identify the precise concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The allocation of additional resources to the schools will be decided in the light of the survey information and the level and nature of the supports will reflect the level of need identified.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to attach particular priority to the issue of educational disadvantage and to ensure that an efficient and effective system of support for disadvantaged pupils is put in place by my Department.</P>

      <P>All primary teachers trained in Ireland are qualified to teach Irish. Some take Irish as a main degree subject in the BEd and the rest are required to complete successfully courses in professional Irish. All must attend approved three-week courses in the Gaeltacht in order to be recognised as being fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Teachers not trained in Ireland must pass the qualifying examination in Irish, An Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge. This is held twice a year and comprises an aural, an oral and two written modules. Candidates may sit each of the modules separately and obtain a pass in the overall examination on a cumulative basis over a period of years. The standard required for a pass in the examination is the equivalent of that applying to teachers who have qualified in the colleges of education in Ireland. As a minimum requirement, candidates must demonstrate that they have attained the level of mastery of the language required to teach Irish to pupils in sixth class in the primary school. Since 1996, qualified teachers from other EU countries have been given provisional recognition for up to three years without having passed the qualifying examination.</P>
      <P>All primary teachers in ordinary classes teach Irish on a daily basis. The number involved is approximately 17,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has recently completed a revision of the primary curriculum. As was done in the case of all subjects, teachers were issued with new programmes in Irish in September 1999. These were set out in two booklets &ndash; a curriculum statement incorporating the aims, objectives and content for each class level and teacher <Col N="878" /> guidelines containing suggested approaches to the teaching of the subject. The revised primary curriculum contains two programmes in Irish, a programme for all-Irish and Gaeltacht schools and a programme for schools whose teaching medium is English.</P>
      <P>These programmes are based on modern approaches to language teaching and have as their basic tenet an emphasis on communication through the spoken language. The communicative method requires that a message is to be transmitted, understood and responded to through the target language. It involves pupils working in pairs and in small groups and includes games, tasks and activities which engage the learners' attention. There is little or no emphasis, particularly at the early stages, on rote learning nor on grammatical and language drills. Grammatical errors are accepted and regarded as a normal, necessary stage in the learning process. Pupils should enjoy communicating through the second language during activities such as role-play, sketches, drama and dialogue.</P>
      <P>The sets of objectives in the revised programmes are set out under four strands, namely listening, speaking, reading and writing. Theses are further sub-divided into strand units, which are developing interest, understanding language and using language. In addition, there is an emphasis on language functions and language awareness. Teachers are encouraged to use a variety of methodologies in their teaching, depending on the topic in hand and on the learning needs of the pupils. The teacher guidelines contain many recommendations and exemplars designed to assist teachers in their efforts to make the pupils' learning interesting, active and enjoyable. The use of Irish as a language of daily communication in the schools is strongly advocated.</P>
      <P>The minimum time recommended for the teaching of Irish in the revised primary curriculum is 2.5 hours in infant classes and 3.5 hours in classes I to VI per week. It is envisaged that an appropriate proportion of the discretionary curriculum time of one hour per week for infant classes and two hours per week for classes I to VI would also be devoted to the teaching of Irish.</P>
      <P>At second level, Irish is taught in accordance with syllabi approved by my Department. These aim to develop the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. Provision is made for the development of language awareness and cultural awareness, especially in the syllabi for the established leaving certificate. Irish can be studied at higher, ordinary or foundation level for the junior certificate and for the established leaving certificate. The junior certificate and leaving certificate syllabi are based on the same general principles of language learning and teaching which underpin the revised programme for Irish in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The curriculum of a secondary school must include instruction in a syllabus approved by the Minister in Irish as one of a number of subjects. The approved course for junior pupils in second<Col N="879" /> ary schools must include a number of specified subjects one of which is Irish. In the case of the established leaving certificate, the approved course for recognised senior pupils must include not less than five subjects from a specified list. One of these must be Irish.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied have specific requirements regarding subjects to be studied. The study of Irish is a requirement for both of these courses.</P>
    <P>The rules of the Department of Education and Science for second level schools do not prescribe a specific amount of time to be devoted to the teaching of Irish each day. Depending on the year of study and on the programme being followed, it is estimated that, in general, between two hours and three hours 20 minutes per class group per week are allocated to the teaching of Irish.</P>
