    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding promised legislation arising from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, does the Taoiseach share my concern that the announced rates of inflation this year have entirely wiped out the value of the first pay increase under the agreement, thereby undermining social consensus? Has the Minister for Finance, whose budget is partly responsible for the high inflation figures, plans to introduce supplementary measures to reduce other purchase taxes, such as VAT, in a compensatory measure so as to reduce the current rate of inflation, given <Col N="729" /> that the Government has the fiscal capacity to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is legislation in this regard and I do not know to what Bill the Deputy referred. The increase in the inflation rate for March was in line with expectations. The figures have been pushed upwards by a number of exceptional factors, including the tax on tobacco products and the price of oil. The predictions for later this year and next year are known and are for a downward spiral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the shocking revelations yesterday in Dublin Castle regarding the activities of a lobbyist, Mr. Dunlop, and the widespread concern that these activities are corrupting the body politic, is the Government prepared to consider taking No. 74, the Registration of Lobbyists (No. 2) Bill, 1999 in my name, on the Order Paper in Government time? Do Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats think we would be doing every elected Member of the House a service, as Deputy O'Kennedy said, by registering these very unsavoury activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the Private Member's Bill, as I said last June in the House, if there is a way of regulating this I am in favour of it, as it would protect public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>To do so would be a major task. As I said last year, would we include the IFA&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and every other organisation as lobbyists, and if so how would this be done? If people are serious about it, I would support a committee of the House examining how it could be done properly, rather than just putting together a few ideas and calling it a Bill. We do not have a Bill which would be workable. If Deputy Quinn in interested, we can ask a committee of the House to examine the issue to see if we can achieve what is being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach has said and suggest that the way forward is to take the Bill, which has already been printed, on Second Stage and to amend it in line with precedent. There are public representatives in the House who are sickened by the revelations. It is presumed that their families are associated with these practices and that for all intents are purposes all politicians are the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not all the same and for our mutual self-protection Second Stage of the Bill should be taken without delay. A committee of the House can then amend the Bill as it wishes. If the Taoiseach does not move quickly on this, he will damage the very fibre of the democratic process. I urge the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party to reconsider the issue. There is a time honoured precedent for taking a Bill on Second Stage and amending it on Committee Stage. The Taoiseach raises a serious question by refusing to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Quinn is serious about this matter, and he says he is, it can be referred to a committee of the House which has done a good job with the public offices legislation, which we will hopefully have this summer, and on other matters. The first item can be the Bill referred to by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it has no definition as to what a lobbyist is &ndash; it is hopeless. As I said last summer, if we are serious about it I will co-operate with having it considered by a committee, something I think we should do as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Government is proposing that the matter be referred to a committee, can I take it the Government will take on its responsibilities and put a proposal before the committee, rather than simply throwing the problem to a committee without a Government lead as could be expected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton can take that as read. As the Deputy knows, when this matter was examined by the previous Government, when much legislation was introduced concerning many of these issues, the issue of lobbyists was the one issue which was left out as the Government could <Col N="731" /> not find an easy definition. Comprehensive legislation was introduced, but that issue was omitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The easiest thing in the world for the Government to do is to pass the matter over to a committee. To demonstrate that this matter is not being kicked to touch by the Government it should bring forward a worked out proposal, however difficult that may be to draft. I do not doubt that the difficulties referred to by the Taoiseach exist. The Government has a responsibility to propose something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the statements yesterday on the Nevin licensing issue, legislation to deal with the removal of a judge, should it come to pass, is required as recommended in the report on the courts and the Judiciary and the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I accept that it will take some time to introduce the constitutional changes recommended in the report. Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce legislation to deal with the more narrow issue, namely, how this can be handled by the Houses to ensure that whatever procedure might be used in the removal of a judge will not be open to judicial review thereafter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make any comment on that matter until the inquiry is complete. With regard to the Deputy's first question, the Government is examining seriously the constitutional amendment, which his committee has recommended and, hopefully, it will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the proposed constitutional changes but the committee also proposed that judges' inquiry legislation would be necessary to deal with the procedures in the Houses. There is an urgency in bringing forward that legislation. There will not be the delay associated with <Col N="732" /> a constitutional change. Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that, possibly during the recess and without relating it to any particular case, that procedure will be put in place and a Bill will be ready when we resume business after the recess?</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 6 adds a new paragraph, section 7(3)(<i>e</i>), which indicates that where the educational establishment is a university or other third level institution, it is not discrimination to provide different treatment to mature students at that establishment. Existing legislation, the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1992, provides a definition of a mature student in the context of the administration by local authorities of the higher education grant scheme. A mature student is a person of 23 years or older in the year of entry to third level. This amendment was brought forward because concern has been expressed to me that the Equal Status Bill took no account of existing admissions policies at universities which afford preferential treatment when admitting mature students. I accordingly made an appropriate amendment to ensure these policies are not overridden by the Equal Status Bill.</P>

    <P>When the Equal Status Bill was discussed on Report Stage on 16 February, I was pressed to accept a number of amendments to sections of the Bill dealing with discriminating clubs, particularly with reference to the impact of those provisions on golf clubs and for women golfers. I indicated that it was my intention to consider the issues raised, to consult with the Attorney General and to meet the Golfing Union of Ireland and the Irish Ladies Golf Union. While I gave no undertaking on that occasion on a substantive amendment, I said I would ensure the matters raised were given careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Arising from further consideration of the issues raised, the consultations with the Attorney General and the meetings I held with the two golfing bodies, amendments were made in the Seanad to the provisions dealing with registered clubs. The purpose of amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 13 is to introduce a greater degree of flexibility into procedures related to discriminating clubs. Under the new procedures, on the first finding by a District Court that the club is a discriminating club, the certificate of registration is suspended for a per<Col N="740" /> iod of up to 30 days. The suspension may be appealed and, on appeal, affirmed or varied. On subsequent finding of discrimination, section 10 comes into play &ndash; the club is liable to forfeit its certificate of registration.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of the Bill there has been an opportunity not only for the club to appeal against the finding that it is a discriminating club, but to seek a reversal of that finding on the basis that it has put its house in order. Under section 10, if the club seeks such a reversal, its certificate of registration can be renewed while the case is pending.</P>
    <P>The amendment I propose will act as a warning system for discriminating clubs. A club will not be liable to lose its certificate of registration the first time it discriminates but, ultimately, if a club continues to discriminate, it is liable to lose its certificate of registration. Many golf clubs operate a dual structure with separate streams for men and women. If the golf clubs are not to be found discriminating, they will have to adjust their rules and practices. The area is complex and, once the legislation is in place, I will ask the Equality Authority to draw up a code of practice in this area. Such a code of practice, as provided for under section 56 of the Employment Equality Act, will be admissible as evidence in court.</P>

      <P>This issue has been debated at length on all Stages of the Bill. I regret the Minister has taken the easy option regarding clubs which discriminate. The issue arose in the context of golf clubs which discriminate against women but has wider implications in relation to other clubs which discriminate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister will ask the Equality Authority to draw up codes of practice but what powers of enforcement will those codes of practice have? The courts will deal with the provisional suspension of the licence of a club. Under the amendment, a club can be suspended for 30 days and can then appeal. The club could win that appeal. This is not a strong way to deal with clubs which discriminate against people on any of the grounds in the legislation.</P>
      <P>How would the code of practice influence a court? Does the Minister envisage any way, if the measure is found to be ineffective, this could be dealt with? Genuine concerns were raised by the bodies which approached us to say that clubs which want to discriminate will find ways round the legislation. This is not as strong as we had hoped. We wanted it to be clear that a club which discriminates will be severely punished.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in reaction to the concerns expressed by the clubs, has given them a second chance. He has said that if they discriminate there will be a period before the licence is taken from them. The legislation is being watered down. Many people would say these clubs had plenty of opportunities to get their houses in order. I hope this does not become an excuse for clubs to go back to court again and again. Will <Col N="741" /> the Minister give an assurance that this will not become a delaying tactic used and abused by clubs which discriminate? </P>
      <P>We cannot underestimate the challenge it will be for some clubs to introduce a dual form of membership. That is a good and interesting way to handle the problems which were there. We cannot underestimate the resistance to change which there has been and the difficulty in setting a non-discriminatory way of operating in some clubs. I hope this does not become a delaying tactic for clubs and that they react to the positive aspects of equal status legislation rather than fight against them in the District Court and then have to go to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised to hear Deputy O'Sullivan suggest and that Deputy Fitzgerald holds the view that the measures in this legislation are not strong enough. On the first occasion, the legislation provides for the suspension of the certificate of registration. That, in itself, is a serious enough step. On a subsequent occasion, there is provision in the legislation for the forfeiture of the certificate of registration. Clearly, that is a very serious sanction and is something about which the clubs are quite worried. It is felt these are the sanctions required in the legislation and no apology is made for them. To suggest that these sanctions are minor, technical or are not strong enough is grossly mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>

      <P>In regard to the guidelines and whether they are mandatory, they are obviously guidelines in accordance with the legislation. In section 56(4), it is specified that an approved code of practice will be admissible in evidence. Clearly, any such evidence will have a cogent effect. I would not anticipate that it would have been worth our while including the provision in the legislation if it were to be negated. In those circumstances, I hope Deputies are reassured in terms of the legislation, that is, the codes of practice, the sanctions and the possibility of going to court.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>Section 9: In page 15, subsection (1), lines 46 and 47, and in page 16, lines 1 and 2, paragraph (<i>a</i>) deleted and the following new paragraph substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) if its principal purpose is to cater only for the needs of &ndash;</P>
      <P>(i) persons of a particular gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, nationality or ethnic or national origin,</P>
      <P>(ii) persons who are members of the Traveller community, or</P>
      <P>(iii) persons who have no religious belief,</P>
      <P>it refuses membership to other persons,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which was made on the advice of the Attorney General, Mr. McDowell, is intended to protect rights of freedom of association. The Attorney General has advised that the existing exemption in section 9 (1)(<i>a</i>) does not sufficiently protect such rights. For example, the Free Masons are not a religious body and, therefore, cannot avail of the exemption in section 9(1)(<i>a</i>). It is, however, a body which is set up to encourage interpersonal bonds of a fraternal nature and are thus, <i>par excellence</i>, as a body of individuals who are exercising their constitutional right of freedom of association. Our advice is that it would be extremely difficult to justify in law a refusal to renew the Mason's certificate of registration which is based not on any drink related ground, but on their refusal to admit women.</P>
      <P>The same logic extends to many other groups, lesbian and gay organisations, the ICA and Traveller groups, which might well wish to exclude members of a particular category. There is no rational basis on which to suggest that such groups do not enjoy the same right as others to drink together in the privacy of their own clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment extends the exemption to protect clubs whose principal purpose is to cater only for persons of a particular gender, marital status, <Col N="743" /> family status, sexual orientation, religious belief or no belief, age, disability, nationality or ethnic or national origin or members of the Traveller community. It does not include race or colour based clubs. Thus a club catering for the needs of widows, Travellers, Free Masons, Italians and so on will not risk forfeiture of its certificate of registration if it refuses to admit other persons. I stress that these changes were included on the advice of the Attorney General and have been carefully formulated to pass constitutional muster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I see from where the Minister is coming and that organisations would want to gather for particular purposes &ndash; for example, the ICA and gay and lesbian organisations and so on. I see why the Minister would want to protect such organisations. Is it his opinion that it cannot be used as a way to discriminate? That is the danger in this clause. The definition of the principal purpose of the organisation is what I am concerned about, that is, that an organisation could not just exclude women for example in a discriminatory way by using this clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister lobbied by many groups in relation to this protection? If so, who lobbied him? The Minister mentioned the Free Masons. The point Deputy O'Sullivan raised was interesting. While we understand the principle of protection of free association of groups, is there a danger that it could be abused or, as used to happen in golf clubs, access to services, which should be available to all people, could be narrowed down and people could be excluded from them? I will be interested to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with this is that there will always be the danger that some loophole will be found. I was not subjected to any pressure in terms of this amendment. It was the strong advice of the Attorney General that the amendment should be made. It stands to reason if one examines it. For example, nobody would suggest that I should insist that I become a member of the Irish Countrywomen's Association. I am certain I would not be admitted and it would be ludicrous if I was able to insist. There might be men who feel they should be members of the Irish Countrywomen's Association and they may have an objection to being refused, but there is little I can do for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It makes sense to ensure we have a bit of commonsense and that is what we are engaged in here. Obviously, there are tremendous legal niceties here and one would expect nothing less from the Attorney General. He has drafted this as tightly as he possibly could. I have confidence that the legislation would pass a constitutional test. I cannot be expected, in the final analysis, to <Col N="744" /> put square pegs in round holes nor should round holes be expected to accept square pegs.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (1), between lines 12 and 13, the following new paragraphs inserted: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) it has different types of membership, access to which is not based on any discriminatory ground,</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) for the purpose of reducing or eliminating the effect of any rule or practice of the club (whether adopted before or after the commencement of this section) restricting access to particular types of membership to persons of a particular gender it offers concessionary rates, fees or membership arrangements to persons who were or are disadvantaged by any such rule or practice,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments were introduced in response to various concerns expressed by women golfers that the Equal Status Bill, although intended to promote greater equality, might not achieve this aim or could even be disadvantageous to women. The new paragraph (c) of section 9(1) will make it clear that clubs can continue to have more than one category of membership, provided that access to such categories is not determined on the basis of a discriminatory ground. It will thus be permissible, for example, for a club to continue to have both full members and associate members so long as men and women can access both categories without discrimination. This was already implicit in the Bill before the present amendment, but there were some misconceptions that the Bill would require the abolition of the associate membership category.</P>
      <P>I have included a new paragraph (d) in section 9(1) which extends the concept of positive action to include concessionary arrangements introduced by a club to mitigate the effect of past gender based discrimination. Thus, for example, a club will not be regarded as discriminatory if it makes concessionary arrangements for former associate members who were excluded from full membership because of their gender. I would emphasise that the new text permits concessionary arrangements but imposes no obligation on clubs to make such arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am aware that women golfers would like us to go further. They have made known to me that they consider it unjust that they could be charged the full levy for joining as full members despite their long association with a club. I have given careful consideration to formulating an amendment to meet these concerns. However, I am advised that it would not be appropriate to go further than I have in addressing the position of women in golf clubs. I assure the House that I have made absolutely certain that I have gone as far as I possibly could.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the balance the Minister has tried to bring in, it is difficult to make up for past discrimination. This confronts people in society all the time. People are constantly hampered because of discrimination in the past. An example is the issue of women's representation in public life. Clearly there has been exclusion of women from public life, but does one immediately move on to introduce quota systems, take positive action and so on, and how does one do that? As much positive action as possible should be built in to make up for past discrimination. However, it is a question of balancing rights in the here and now.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the main issue is that both full and associate membership should be available equally to men and women. That is a very good basic principle and I certainly accept it. It appears that clubs cannot be obliged to make up for past discrimination by bringing in a particular rate for women who have been discriminated against over a long period. However, the amendment certainly allows them the possibility to take account of the discrimination. I hope clubs will look seriously at this legislation and exercise discretion where it is allowed in the case of women who wanted to be full members but could not be. The legislation allows for a discretionary approach by clubs and, now that fees have gone up substantially and extremely large fees now have to be paid, they should build on it wherever possible.</P>
      <P>Experience is that where there is no legislation, action to adjust past discrimination and deal with the effects of it has not been strong. That is why legislation is always so important. It sets a standard, and attitudes and behaviour change once legislation is in place. We know that from experience.</P>
      <P>On balance the Minister has gone as far as he could. There is discretion for clubs to deal with past discrimination. The point is that making up for past discrimination is not easy. It is very challenging, and there is no easy way in law to do it. It behoves us, therefore, to have the strongest legislation we can to deal with discrimination so that we do not find ourselves again in 20 years' time trying to make up for past discrimination in whatever area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has come this distance. We all regret that he cannot go any further to address past discrimination. Having gone through this with a fine toothcomb, we realise the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Equality Authority drawing up a code of practice in relation to clubs, loss of licences and so on. Does he intend that the code of practice would incorporate issues of discrimination so that, for example, male golfers will be made aware that they can now become associate members of clubs or that their club can facilitate them in becoming associate members? I am sure there are many men who would prefer to pay the lower associate member<Col N="746" /> ship fee. I hope the male golfing union, the Irish Golfing Union, will now adopt a positive approach in encouraging clubs to provide for the different categories without discrimination and to make allowances for the fact that in the past women members could not become full members by not charging the large membership fees to such members who, through no fault of their own, could not be full members in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies have graciously acknowledged, the provision now introduced in the legislation goes as far as possible. Golf clubs should take the opportunity provided in the legislation to offer the concessionary rates suggested. It must be clear to everybody that people who have been members of a club for a very long time are in a different category to new members. It is my sincere wish that clubs throughout the country will accept the spirit of this legislation, understand why I could not go any further, and implement the measures in accordance with the wishes of the Oireachtas and society generally, which the Oireachtas reflects.</P>
      <P>There may be some clubs which will not exercise discretion by way of positive discrimination and there is little I can do by way of sanction to ensure that they do. However, it must be clear to everybody that sometimes justice must be done without there being a stick to ensure that it is done. There are some things in life that one must do because they are morally right. It is morally right in this case that clubs should give sympathetic consideration to the women concerned but there is little I can do if they do not. Clearly, society will be the best judge in that event.</P>

      <P>We have concluded very important legislation today. I pay tribute to all <Col N="748" /> who have been involved, to the Minister and the staff in his Department who have worked so hard over such a long period on this Bill. Many people have been awaiting this legislation. It is worth noting that the Equality Authority is receiving about 1,000 inquiries per month relating to issues of discrimination and equality. In our Celtic tiger economy there is no room for complacency on how issues of discrimination are being tackled and the amount of discrimination being experienced. For many people, the gay and lesbian community, the disabled, those of a different race, Travellers and so on, access to services, quite apart from discrimination in employment, is a big issue. We must continue to monitor the accommodation of such people within services and the outcome for them of access to those services. This legislation will be an important arm in dealing with these issues. It is necessary to give the Equality Authority the resources it needs to do the job as well as it can.</P>

I echo what Niall Crowley, chief executive of the Equality Authority, said last week that this part of the legislation needs to be tested to see how far it can go.

    <P>In particular, I thank the staff of my Department for all their work in drafting and carrying through the amendments to the legislation. It took a considerable length of time and a great deal of expertise for which we are all extremely grateful. When enacted I intend to bring this measure into operation as soon as practicable. It will be necessary to make regulations to put in place staff, the Equality Authority, the office of the Director of Equality Investigations and make other administrative changes. I envisage this will <Col N="749" /> take some months. As Deputies are aware, I cannot ratify the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination until this legislation is in place. When it is I confirm we will be taking the necessary steps to ratify it. I thank the staff of the House for their considerable assistance during the passage of the legislation.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The enactment of this short but important Bill will enable Ireland to accede to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December 1994. The purpose of the convention is to secure the better protection of personnel engaged in UN efforts in the field of preventive diplomacy, peace making, peacekeeping, peace building and humanitarian and other operations. The current position is that 43 states have signed the convention and, of that number, 31 are parties to the convention, having ratified, acceded to or approved its terms. The convention entered into force on 15 January 1999.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a long and distinguished record of involvement with peacekeeping missions throughout the world and it will come as no surprise to Members that we were active in promoting agreement on the adoption of this international instrument, in fact we were a co-sponsor of the resolution which led to the convention. The adoption of the convention reflected the concern felt among the international community generally at the growing number of deaths and injuries resulting from deliberate attacks against UN personnel.</P>
      <P>It is fitting that we should reflect on the dedication shown by our men and women of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces who volunteer for what are often dangerous missions with the United Nations. I have had the privilege of seeing at first hand the work done by gardaí on such missions. Likewise, my colleague, the Minister for Defence, has seen the tremendous contribution made by the members of the Defence Forces to UN missions. Last May a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, as it was then known, visited the Irish troops serving with UNIFIL. That delegation received extensive briefings from the officer commanding the battalion and his staff officers and also had the opportunity to meet the troops and see at first hand the conditions under which they operate in the Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving abroad is of paramount importance to the Government and every effort is made to ensure that those who volunteer for foreign missions are adequately trained and equipped to carry them out. Sadly, however, <Col N="750" /> not all those who volunteer for UN missions return safely. I want to remember today those who lost their lives while serving with such missions. One member of the Garda Síochána lost his life in Sarajevo in 1995. Eighty one members of the Defence Forces have also lost their lives. This figure includes the four young soldiers who died in the tragic traffic accident in the Lebanon on 14 February last. Today, too, we must remember the many others who have been injured, some quite seriously, in the course of duty with UN missions.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the bravery of all who have given their lives serving with missions striving for peace in war torn parts of the world should be remembered with fitting memorials. Deputies might like to know that a memorial to the memory of all those who have died on UN duty is located at the headquarters of the Irish United Nations Veterans Association in Dublin. I also understand from my colleague, the Minister for Defence, that there are a number of memorials at various Army barracks around the country to the memory of the deceased members of the Defence Forces who have lost their lives while serving abroad.</P>
    <P>The convention applies not only to soldiers and police but also to civilians who come within the definition of &ldquo;United Nations worker&rdquo; contained in section 1. What the convention means in practical terms for the members of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and others serving with peacekeeping missions is that, following the passing of this legislation and the completion of the accession process, they will have the added protection that the convention provides. I will give a brief outline of where the members of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces who will benefit from the terms of the convention are currently serving. As regards the Garda contingents, at present there are 50 members engaged in peacekeeping duties with the United Nations overseas to whom the convention applies, 35 members are with the UN international police task force in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 15 members are with the UN force in Cyprus. We have about 650 members of the Defence Forces serving with eight UN missions overseas who will benefit from the provisions of this convention. The vast bulk of them are in the Lebanon, approximately 600.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that Article 2 of the convention specifically excludes operations sanctioned under chapter VII of the UN Charter in which any of the personnel are engaged as combatants against organised armed forces and to which the law of international armed conflict applies. At present we have 197 members of the Defence Forces serving with missions sanctioned under chapter VII. Fifty one members are located in Bosnia-Herzegovina with the stabilisation force for that country. A further 100 or so personnel are in Kosovo and 40 personnel are serving with the United Nations transitional administration in East Timor. While these members of the Defence Forces do not come within the remit of this con<Col N="751" /> vention, they do have the protection afforded by the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Effect was given to the Geneva Conventions in Irish law by the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962.</P>
    <P>Dwelling for a few moments on the role of the gardaí in peacekeeping operations, I refer to a discussion paper on Ireland's involvement in international police missions which I published last December. It outlines the history of Garda involvement with peacekeeping missions stretching back ten years. I was of the view that it was right we should evaluate the significant contribution made by the Garda in that ten year period and also plan for the future. I arranged that a copy of the discussion paper be placed in the Oireachtas Library of this House on 7 December 1999. For those who have had an opportunity to read it I think they will agree that the gardaí have done us proud in the contribution they have made to the many missions abroad. Since 1989 more than 500 gardaí have served with United Nations missions and with the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, in locations such as Namibia, Cambodia, Cyprus, East Timor, the Balkans and many others. I look forward to receiving the views of interested individuals, groups and organisations on the issues raised in the document.</P>
    <P>Returning to the provisions of the Bill, the key requirements of the Convention are in Article 9 which requires us to make:</P>
    <P>&ndash;attacks upon the person or liberty of United Nations personnel and associated personnel;</P>
    <P>&ndash;attacks on property used by such personnel; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;certain threats against such personnel offences under our law.</P>
    <P>In addition we are required to establish jurisdiction over these offences where the alleged offender is found on our territory and we do not extradite him or her &ndash; in that event we are obliged to submit the case to the competent authority for the purpose of prosecuting the person in our courts.</P>
    <P>The main provisions are to be found in the first four sections. Sections 6 to 9 provide for consequential amendments to other legislation.</P>
    <P>The offences under the Bill relate specifically to attacks on &ldquo;United Nations workers&rdquo; and on the premises of vehicles of those workers. The definitions of &ldquo;United Nations personnel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Associated personnel&rdquo; in the Convention have been combined to form the definition of &ldquo;United Nations worker&rdquo; in section 1. Similarly, the definition of what amounts to a &ldquo;United Nations operation&rdquo; is as set out in the Convention. I have scheduled the Convention to the Bill for ease of reference.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the situation where a &ldquo;United Nations worker&rdquo; is attacked. The section provides that an act done outside the State <Col N="752" /> against a UN worker, that, if done in the State, would constitute one of the offences specified in Part I of the Second Schedule to the Bill, shall be an offence and punishable as if done in the State. The approach taken in Part I of the Second Schedule is to list the relevant offences against the person under our existing law. The list includes sexual offences under the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990; the offences against the person provided for in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, and the offence of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or property under section 2 of the Explosives Substances Act, 1883 .</P>
    <P>Attacks on the property of a &ldquo;United Nations worker&rdquo; are dealt with in section 3 and Part II of the Second Schedule to the Bill specifies the relevant offences under our law. This section provides that an act done outside the State in connection with an attack on the premises or vehicle of a UN worker, that, if done in the State, would amount to an offence set out in Part II of the Second Schedule to the Bill, shall be an offence and punishable as if done in the State. The offences listed in Part II of the Second Schedule are the offences against property set out in the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, and an offence under section 2 of the Explosives Substances Act, 1883. The section also includes a definition of what constitutes &ldquo;premises&rdquo; or a &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; of a &ldquo;United Nations worker&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 rely on existing offences under our criminal law while section 4(3) creates a new offence of threatening, carrying a penalty of up to ten years imprisonment. In accordance with subsection (2) of the section a person commits the offence if in order to compel a person to do or to refrain from doing any act, that person threatens to commit an act which is an offence under section 2 or section 3 of the Bill and the perpetrator intends that the person to whom the threat is made shall fear that the threat will, in fact, be carried out.</P>
    <P>All trials on indictment are conducted at the suit of the Director of Public Prosecutions but prosecutions for summary offences and the institution of preliminary examinations for indictable offences, while such examinations continue, may be commenced by others. Because of the unusual and international character of the offences we are dealing with here, all prosecutions under the Act will, in accordance with section 5, require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That section also contains a provision to take account of overlapping provisions in legislation relating to extraterritorial jurisdiction. Already under section 38 of the Extradition Act, 1965, an offence committed outside the State by an Irish national is in certain circumstances an offence under Irish law. In the event of an Irish national finding himself or herself accused of an offence under the Bill which has been committed abroad, any proceedings will be taken under <Col N="753" /> this Bill and not under section 38 of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 to 9 deal with consequential amendments to other statutes. I will mention briefly, what those amendments entail. The Defence Act, 1954, is being amended as regards the jurisdiction of courts-martial to deal with offences under the Bill. The effect of the amendments of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, is that pleas of guilty in preliminary examinations, while such examinations continue, in relation to offences in the Bill will be sent forward for sentence to the court of trial and that applications for bail may be made only to the High Court. The Criminal Justice Act, 1999, contains provisions abolishing the preliminary examination in the District Court with the necessary consequential changes. However, until such time as those provisions are brought into effect we must continue to make provision in relation to the preliminary examination. My Department is in consultation with the courts in relation to the changes in court rules which will be required before the relevant provisions of the 1999 Act can be brought into force.</P>
    <P>Offence under the Bill will be added to the Schedule to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, by virtue of section 8. This means that the offences cannot be considered to be political offences and consequently extradition cannot be refused in relation to them on that ground. Given the seriousness of the offences in this Bill I have decided that they should be subject to the bail regime provided for in the Bail Act, 1997 &ndash; section 9 so provides.</P>
    <P>The Convention requires States Parties to take jurisdiction over Convention offences. This means that prosecutions for the same act could, therefore, be possible in several countries. Section 10 has regard to that by providing that where a person has been acquitted or convicted outside Ireland of an offence, then that person shall not be proceeded against for an offence under the Bill here, in respect of the act constituting the first-mentioned offence.</P>
    <P>I hope the proposals in this short but significant Bill will meet with the approval of all Deputies. I was glad to be able to give priority to the drafting of this Bill within my substantial legislative programme. Since taking office, 25 Bills which I have brought before the Oireachtas have been enacted. I have a further 14 Bills before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am determined to continue with my reform of the law both on the criminal and the civil side and to that end I have another 25 Bills in course of preparation &ndash; in all, the legislative programme for my Department amounts to close to one third of the Government's overall legislative work programme. Maybe Deputy Jim Higgins will seek an increase from his Leader.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill can be enacted at the earliest opportunity so that the accession process can be put in train and the added protection afforded by the Convention will be available to all those who serve with the UN on peacekeeping missions. <Col N="754" /> Those dedicated men and women serving with UN peacekeeping missions abroad deserve no less from us as legislators.</P>
    <P>I will listen carefully to all comments and suggestions during the debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I thank the Minister for recognising our capacity for keeping him on his toes and the need for due monetary recognition for same.</P>
      <P>One of the most gratifying experiences I had as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence was the visits to Irish personnel serving overseas with the United Nations. The Irish personnel in Israel, Syria, Bosnia-Herzegovina and in other parts of the world are a credit to Ireland. I had the pleasure of seeing at first hand on two occasions the peace maintenance role of the Garda and Irish soldiers in Cyprus as part of the UNFICYP operation For many years Irish personnel have been to the forefront in patrolling the peace line between the Greek and Turkisk sectors in the island and have been extremely successful in ensuring the integrity of the peace line by being firm and fair in the handling of situations which can arise from time to time.</P>
      <P>I also had the pleasure of visiting south Lebanon on two occasions. The UNIFIL operation in south Lebanon is in one of the most hazardous trouble spots in the world. The Irish contingent serve side by side with contingents from Fiji, France, Holland and so on. One has only to look at the number of young Irish soldiers who have died in the service of international peace in Lebanon alone, including a neighbour of mine, Private Billy Kedian, last May to appreciate just how dangerous the situation is on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>The most harrowing experience I came across was on a visit to Kano in the Fiji battalion area. An Israeli shell hit a compound where almost 100 Lebanese women and children were sheltering. They were all wiped out. The evidence of the carnage is still splattered on the walls and floor of the ruined building. At both of the medal parades which I attended in south Lebanon one listened with considerable pride when in the presence of officers from all the other UNIFIL battalions the force commander Wozniak lavished profuse but well deserved praise on the skills of the Irish and particularly the diplomatic skills they bring with them as peacekeepers and as peacemakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the secrets of the success of Irish UN activity abroad has been that the Irish do not see themselves as peacekeepers or peace enforcers. They see their role as the more constructive one of building peace. To see practical examples of this is very gratifying. Irish engineers from the engineering corps make themselves available for local water and sewerage schemes and the Irish involve themselves in assisting and building local community projects. One of my most satisfying experiences was to visit an orphanage near Tibnin <Col N="755" /> which is largely funded by Irish soldiers from their own salaries. I vividly recollect an officer called Mick Doherty sitting on the floor in the midst of a group of Lebanese orphan children who were counting from one to five in Dublin accents given to them by Mick Doherty, may God forgive him.</P>
    <P>At home we hear only of the major incidents when soldiers die or are badly wounded. We do not realise, and I did not realise until I went to Lebanon, that incidents occur almost every day. These are recorded as &ldquo;firings close&rdquo;. Every morning the roads must be mine-swept, which is another precarious exercise. One never knows when the Hizbollah will decide to strike at the Israeli occupied sectors and this is guaranteed to invite a swift and deadly Israeli response. In such situations the Irish and other UN contingents are like the meat in a sandwich. They are doing what we and the UN Security Council give them the mandate to do &ndash; underpinning and enforcing a UN mandate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure before the Dáil to improve the protection of our personnel serving abroad by acceding to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. Once again, however, we have been exposed for our incomprehensible tardiness in ratifying international conventions which we have enthusiastically promoted and embraced. How ironic &ndash; indeed one would be tempted to say how hypocritical &ndash; that Ireland sponsored, as one of the co-sponsors, the resolution which led to the convention being adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1994 yet we still have not ratified the convention more than five years later. This is caused not so much by hypocrisy as by a combination of administrative lethargy and a kind of innate caution. We prefer to wait to see how the convention affects other signatory states before we ratify it ourselves. Having sponsored the idea, instead of leading the way as we should have done, we are now coming in at number 30 in the league of signatory countries.</P>
    <P>Because the role of peacemaker is not always understood, it involves risks and dangers. Because warring factions are often ruthless they tend to have scant regard for the presence of peacekeepers or anyone else who gets in their way. It is not good enough that members of a neutral force, doing the bidding of the UN Security Council should be shot at or physically harmed. Will the Minister indicate to the House how, in practical terms, the convention and its powers have contributed to improving the safety of UN personnel abroad? For example, how many charges have been brought in respect of the provisions of this convention against the signatory countries? How many convictions have been won in respect of aggression or attacks on UN personnel?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It affords us an opportunity of recognising the unique contribution which UN personnel from Ireland, both gardaí and Army, <Col N="756" /> have made overseas. Long before Ireland took its place on the world stage or gained significance or prominence in the spheres of culture, sport, politics or humanitarian work, Irish soldiers abroad carried the Irish flag very proudly. All of us who heard the news of the Niemba ambush in the Congo recall that moment vividly. We recall the sense of national trauma as the cortege drove up O'Connell Street in Dublin bearing the bodies of Captain Gleeson and his comrades who lost their lives in far away Niemba. We recognise the ongoing contribution and the daily hazards which soldiers from this country face in the far corners of the world in ensuring that a UN mandate passed in New York is enforced in the interest of world peace.</P>
    <P>We must also remember the wives and children of our soldiers who make considerable sacrifices. They remain at home for six months in the case of personnel serving in South Lebanon and much longer in the case of personnel serving in other parts of the world such as Cyprus. They make a unique contribution towards ensuring that Ireland plays its part in the maintenance of world peace.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and I do not see how we can improve on it. The Minister will be delighted to hear it is unlikely that Fine Gael will propose any amendments on Committee Stage. The Bill has already been passed by the Seanad and the sooner it passes both Houses the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the belated introduction of this legislation although unfortunately, many UN conventions remain to be ratified and become part of Irish law. Some have been incorporated in amendments to the Human Rights Commission Bill, Committee Stage of which will be debated tomorrow. It is regrettable that it takes so long to enact legislation such as this. It has taken a particularly long time to bring this Bill forward. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the Bill is being debated and, like Deputy Higgins, I do not wish to delay its passage.</P>
      <P>The Bill will allow Ireland to accede to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, which was adopted in 1994. The convention contains a total of 29 Articles, and it details how the convention should be applied. It defines crimes against the UN and associated personnel and anyone who works abroad in a UN capacity is more than likely to be working in an extraordinary and potentially hazardous situation.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a long and proud tradition of service in the UN family. Our defence forces, gardaí and civilian workers have made a massive contribution to the development of the UN. Not all of these people work abroad in a national capacity but they assist in serious international disputes or in crises. Anyone who is working in this capacity will now have the protection of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is 40 years since Irish troops first went abroad to serve with the United Nations. For a small country we have made an enormous contri<Col N="757" /> bution. Close to 10% of our military personnel are serving abroad and we are the sixth largest provider of troops to the UN peace missions. In the course of four decades Ireland has paid a high price in terms of the commitment of financial resources and personnel to the pursuit of world peace. However, this pales into insignificance when compared with the price paid by Defence Forces personnel who have been killed or injured in the course of these operations. In recent years our troops have gone to such trouble spots as East Timor and Kosova but the area that has taken the greatest toll, in personnel and casualties, has been Lebanon. It is more than 20 years since UNIFIL was established and tens of thousands of Irish troops have served there in the intervening period. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their willingness to put themselves in danger in the interest of bringing peace to the trouble spots of the world.</P>
    <P>I visited Lebanon with Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy McGennis as part of the delegation referred to by the Minister. We saw at first hand the wonderful work being done by our soldiers and its effect on the local population. We have heard a great deal about the military and peacekeeping aspect of what our soldiers do but their work also has a human side. Deputy Higgins has referred to the orphanage in Tibnin. We were amazed to see people carrying on normal lives in such a situation. We saw young children and elderly people tending animals on the roads. The presence of our troops makes life safer and a little easier for these people. The minesweeping operations to which Deputy Higgins has referred are particularly important. It was brought home to us &ndash; we spent a lot of time in the bunkers &ndash; that those on duty in lookout posts and other outlying areas in particular are in constant danger. We saw the marks caused by shells in Camp Shamrock. The lookout posts are situated at a height facing the positions of the various warring factions on the surrounding hills. It is extremely dangerous and we must pay tribute to the bravery of our forces serving in the area.</P>
    <P>Our troops in Lebanon find themselves in a particularly difficult situation, caught between the two conflicting sides. Most of the casualties and most of the difficulties for our troops result from the activities of the Southern Lebanese Army or the <i>de facto </i>forces as they are described in the report. It is unacceptable that a Government with which we maintain friendly relations, the Government of Israel, should arm, train and finance those who are harassing and attacking our troops. While representations have been made by the Government to the Israeli authorities on this matter, it is essential that the pressure is maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the Dáil on 19 October last that between January and December there were 102 firings recorded at or close to Irish UNIFIL positions, the bulk of which were carried out by the <i>de facto </i>forces, supported by the Israeli defence forces. We are aware of the difficult security situation and the horrific terrorist attacks <Col N="758" /> which have taken place in Israel during the years but this does not and cannot justify a policy of tolerating and encouraging attacks on our troops and those of other nations on peacekeeping missions in south Lebanon. One can only hope the situation in the Middle East will continue to improve and it will not be long before our troops and the entire UNIFIL force can be withdrawn. The progress being made in the implementation of the agreement between Israel and the Palestinians provides grounds for hope. I hope the discussions will continue and reach a fruitful conclusion.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government to provide not just political and moral support for our forces serving with the United Nations but also to ensure when our troops serve abroad on peacekeeping operations that they have the equipment and training necessary to guarantee the maximum possible levels of safety and security. Training is not a problem as our troops have always been well prepared for operations abroad. This is acknowledged in the respect with which they are held by other contingents with which they have served. We witnessed their professionalism at first hand during our visit.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to equipment is much less satisfactory. The long delay in providing the Army with modern armoured personnel carriers is particularly unfortunate. Troops in areas of conflict cannot rely on trucks and jeeps alone. The shortage of adequate equipment, APCs in particular, has meant that our troops have had to depend to some extent on other contingents for protection. This is not operationally desirable. Neither it is good for morale. If we want our troops to be able to play an active role in peacekeeping operations throughout the world the necessary resources and equipment will have to be provided. Money is available. Now that the controversy over the White Paper is behind us the Government must expedite the delivery of the long promised armoured personnel carriers.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána have, as the Minister said, also played a key role in many UN operations abroad. The numbers involved may be smaller but their role is no less important and the dangers no less great. Gardaí have served in countries such as Namibia where they have assisted in the delicate transition to democracy. More recently gardaí have served in countries such as Cyprus and Bosnia Herzegovina.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome as it will give our soldiers, gardaí and civilians who work under the umbrella of the United Nations the full backing and sanction of international law to ensure their safety in areas of conflict. The safety and protection of anyone serving overseas with the United Nations is very important. Although such a convention cannot absolutely guarantee the safety of workers, it will give them and their families an extra degree of comfort that the law is behind them in their important work.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4 which creates a new offence of threatening. It is important to recog<Col N="759" /> nise the pressures which may affect mental as much as physical health. Such pressures should be outlawed and a way found to deal with them in legislation. It is recognised increasingly that bullying is a feature of the workplace. I have received representations from soldiers who believe they were subjected to such pressures during their time in the Army. Will the Minister elaborate on how he sees this section operating in practice?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is important that it becomes law as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is important that we ratify as quickly as possible UN conventions and EU directives. We have been slow to do so in the past, although it may be an administrative issue as opposed to a lack of motivation. It is increasingly being recognised that there is a need for institutions with world authority. This can be seen in the international war tribunals and the support for and development of international law among civilised countries which care about democracy. It should also be seen in the ratification of UN conventions.</P>
      <P>The development of international jurisprudence and tribunals is extremely important in an era of mass communications when one can discover what is happening on the other side of the world within a short period and it is very easy to move quickly from one jurisdiction to another. Universal respect for human rights and standards should not just be an aspiration, it should be translated into law. It is very important that we respect international law and we are showing that respect by transposing into Irish law the convention which is the subject of the Bill. It means that those whom we send or who volunteer to work abroad for the United Nations, whether military or civilian personnel, will have the backup and protection of Irish law.</P>
      <P>The international commitment we are giving in transposing the convention into Irish law is an extremely important aspect of the Bill. The more we can create respect for international institutions, whether the United Nations or tribunals, the better the chance of introducing law where it does not exist or pursuing war criminals to ensure their crimes do not go unpunished. The stronger we can make international law the better we will be able to fight drug dealing and drug pushing. As a general principle, therefore, we should try to transpose conventions into Irish law more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pursued this issue for a long time by way of parliamentary questions relating to the number of conventions outstanding. Time and again I have been surprised at just how slow we have been. Although the political commitment is there, the conventions sometimes tend to be bypassed by domestic legislation. We do not always appreciate the moral power and importance of ratifying conventions. As Deputy Higgins said, <Col N="760" /> there is a need to show the way. We should not always wait until they have been tested elsewhere. We should show our own moral fibre in supporting them.</P>
    <P>The convention provides protection for gardaí, members of the Defence Forces and civilians. In this context the increasing role of NGOs in missions abroad should be noted. We must be more innovative in our training of gardaí and Defence Forces personnel who work with the United Nations. Joint training programmes and courses must be organised for the different groups working abroad. The success of peacekeeping operations abroad will become more dependent on the work done between the Garda, the Defence Forces, the NGOs and the local population. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, this happens in Lebanon all the time. We should pay tribute to the NGOs and to the members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces serving abroad.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the families of all who serve abroad. They support those who go abroad to represent and work for this country in increasingly dangerous circumstances. It is a demanding job when one has to leave one's family for six months or a year and it is worrying for families to hear reports of action abroad. In the past year we have signed orders in the House to send our troops and gardaí to East Timor and Kosovo. Peacekeeping operations can be dangerous. There are risks and people will lose their lives but we must minimise the dangers by giving personnel as much protection as possible.</P>
    <P>I support the suggestion by other Members that a memorial should be located in the House in recognition of the work of those who have gone abroad and those who have sacrificed their lives in the service of this country. We sign the orders to send people abroad and it would be fitting to have a memorial in the House. The Minister should ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>More than 800 people are serving abroad in a variety of missions. The Lebanon is one of the older type peacekeeping missions but there is an increasing number of smaller observer based missions. Having seen at first hand the work troops do abroad, as Deputy Jim Higgins did when he was Minister of State at the Department of Defence and Deputy O'Sullivan and I did last year when we visited Lebanon, one can only marvel at how well they do it over such a long period.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason we have not had more casualties is the discipline, professionalism and standards of our Defence Forces and Garda personnel when they work abroad. I do not want to over-emphasise the dangers and upset family members, but it is only when one visits places, such as Lebanon, and sees the daily risks that one realises the danger of being involved in peacekeeping operations. Mines are cleared every morning and Deputy Jim Higgins mentioned the close firing which happens all the time. The tension and demands on personnel cannot be underestimated. It is important that they have the pro<Col N="761" /> tection of this legislation and that they know we support them in their work.</P>
    <P>The best way to ensure our troops do well when they are abroad is to give them proper training and equipment before they leave. It is disturbing that the United Nations has noted that many armies who go on peacekeeping duties arrive without proper equipment and training. The United Nations has called on member states to improve levels of training and equipment. It is important that we face up to that obligation. The new type of peacekeeping means training must be done here and that equipment will not be supplied as it was in Lebanon. If we are to meet this challenge in the new world order it is essential that we invest in our Defence Forces, particularly if we want to be fully involved in the type of peacekeeping which is necessary in many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>It is becoming clear that our Defence Forces will not be dealing with inter-state conflict but with intra-state conflict. We have seen this develop in Zimbabwe in recent days and weeks. We can see the demands such volatile conflicts would place on all those involved in trying to make peacekeeping effective. Skills, training and logistical support will be needed in many places around the world.</P>
    <P>It is to our credit that we have a good track record in peacekeeping operations and it will be important to develop and enhance that in the future. One way to do that is to invest in training and equipment. Cutbacks in the Defence Forces means it is becoming more difficult for them to have proper training for peacekeeping operations. It is difficult for the Defence Forces to meet current demands let alone become involved in peacekeeping. The extra demands of Partnership for Peace means it will be more difficult for the Defence Forces to carve out time for the type of training needed. We must take some of the tasks of the Defence Forces away from them because they are outdated. Today is not the day to debate that but it is an issue which must be examined.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work done by the United Nations training school in the Curragh in analysing peacekeeping missions in which we have been involved and preparing for future ones. There is scope for giving it more resources and for the Garda and NGOs to become more involved in training. It is a centre of excellence and it is possible, in the context of our commitment to the United Nations, to develop it.</P>

The professionalism and safety of our personnel serving abroad are key issues in that school. It is part of our commitment to the highest standards for those who serve this country here and abroad. We will become more committed to peacekeeping as the years go by and safety, training and international co-operation are central to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies for their welcome for the Bill. I hope it will be enacted quickly so the protections provided by the Convention will be available to our men and women who serve with distinction with UN peacekeeping missions in the quest for peace. Ireland has a long and proud tradition of serving with peacekeeping missions. For a small country we have been able to provide men and women of the highest calibre and dedication to duty to serve abroad.</P>
      <P>Ireland was a co-sponsor of the resolution leading to the Convention and I was glad to be in a position to give priority to the drafting of this Bill. Close to one-third of the Government's legislative programme comes from my Department so I must of necessity prioritise Bills. This is one such Bill which I wish to see passed at the earliest opportunity. The tone of the debate reflects the wish on all sides of the House to enact the Bill quickly and I thank Opposition spokespersons for their support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald raised the issue of a memorial. This proposal has been forwarded by Members before and I indicated that there are a number of memorials around the country. I have no strong view one way or the other about locating a memorial on Leinster lawn. As legislators, perhaps the best recognition we can give to those who died is to ensure the swift passage of the Bill so we give better protection to soldiers and gardaí currently serving abroad or those who will do so in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins and Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the delay in introducing ratification legislation. However, in general, Ireland has a very good record in incorporating conventions into law. This convention was open for signature until December 1995 but we must not lose sight of the fact that the convention only came into effect in January 1999. The Government approved the drafting of this Bill on 9 February 1999 and the Bill was published within six months. This is clear evidence of my wish to ensure that Ireland can accede to the convention at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave priority to the drafting of the Bill and, with the support of all sides in the House, I hope <Col N="763" /> it will become law at an early date. In that context, there is considerable legislation in the pipeline which I am attempting to progress as quickly as possible. The fact that we published this legislation in the context of all other legislation is indicative of the seriousness and importance I attach to it. My priority is to ensure that the protections of the convention are available to Irish personnel.</P>
    <P>As regards conventions and Bills before the House, it is important to state that five of the 14 Bills before the Oireachtas from my Department contain proposals to allow Ireland to give effect to conventions. My record speaks for itself in this respect and I am happy to be judged on it. Work is ongoing within the Department on a number of Bills to give effect in Irish law to conventions, including a Bill to give effect to two UN conventions on extradition which I hope to publish by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Bills before the House relating to conventions include the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1999, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill, 1998, the Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Bill, 1999, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and the Criminal Justice (Illicit Trafficking by Sea) Bill, 2000. Other Bills under preparation which deal with conventions include the Convention on Extradition Procedures between EU Member States Bill, the Contractual Obligations Applicable Law Bill and a Trusts Bill. We have also enacted the Europol Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Higgins and O'Sullivan for commenting favourably on the Garda's excellent peacekeeping record while serving with the UN. This is something of which we can be very proud. Deputy Higgins asked about the number of prosecutions and charges brought in various countries. Deputy Fitzgerald also referred to this issue when she mentioned the practical effect. I regret that I do not have information about the number of prosecutions, if any, which have occurred but I will make inquiries in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked how section 4 would operate. I am not exactly sure what the Deputy has in mind but prosecutions will be taken in states which have satisfied the convention in the normal way if sufficient evidence is available. We will have the opportunity of discussing this and other significant matters on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962. At present, the principal provision is that legislation requires that any person proposing to manufacture cement may do so only in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. During the passage of the Bill through Seanad Éireann, the Minister, Deputy Harney, made it clear that the Government considers the continuation of such a licensing regime unnecessary in current circumstances.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a short, straightforward measure consisting of only two sections. Section 1 provides for the repeal of the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962. Section 2 outlines the Short Title and provides for the ommencement of the Act. The original legislation has been largely unused for over 20 years; therefore, the purpose of this Bill is to remove redundant legislation from the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>The principal provision still remaining in the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962, is that a company must obtain a licence from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if it wishes to manufacture cement in this State. The Cement Act, 1933, gave the then Minister for Industry and Commerce control over the manufacture of cement, namely, who manufactured it and where and how it was done. In addition, the Act provided for the compulsory acquisition of land for the development of cement factories and regulated the construction, maintenance and operation of transport for the purposes of the manufacture and importation of cement.</P>
      <P>The cement legislation was brought forward by the late Seán Lemass in the 1930s to facilitate the development of an indigenous cement industry and has been successful in achieving this aim. The establishment of the first cement manufacturing facility addressed a strategic requirement for the development of the national economy and provided much needed employment throughout the country. The cement plants developed as a consequence of the enactment of this legislation were among the largest industrial developments ever built in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cement Acts provided a protective cocoon which enabled the licensee to invest the significant capital required for the erection of cement works with the assurance that this investment would be protected against unreasonable compe<Col N="765" /> tition, whether from outside or inside the State. The legislation achieved its objective by establishing an indigenous manufacturing base for the production of cement.</P>
    <P>During the passage of this Bill through the Seanad a number of issues were raised concerning the activities of the sole licensee. Only one company, Irish Cement Limited, was granted a licence to manufacture cement. The original licence was granted in 1936 and is currently held by Cement Roadstone Holdings. The Minister made it clear in the Seanad that she would look into certain matters raised in the debate and inquiries are still being pursued in that regard. However, allegations of unfair competition and possible breaches of company law are not directly relevant to this Bill. I am stating this to ensure that it is clearly understood that there is no hidden agenda involved in the repeal of the cement legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation has been amended twice since its enactment. In 1938 and 1962 the original Act was amended with consequential changes in the framework of the statute. The most significant amendment was made in 1962 when those provisions relating to the control of the importation of cement were repealed. That amendment was made in anticipation of Ireland's entry to the EEC, or the Common Market as it was properly known.</P>
    <P>Further changes to the legislation were considered a decade later in the context of Ireland's accession to the EEC. The power to issue licences was reckoned to be in accord with the Treaty of Rome provided that licences were issued on a non-discriminatory basis, irrespective of the nationality of the applicants. Accordingly, no further amendment was made to the legislation at that time.</P>
    <P>In September 1999, the Government decided that the continued existence of a licensing regime for the manufacture of cement originating in the era of protection was no longer necessary in current economic circumstances. During the debate in the Seanad concern was expressed by some Senators that the repeal of the cement legislation might create a regulatory vacuum. There was a particular concern about the environmental impact of cement manufacturing.</P>
    <P>The regulatory standards which apply today, whether in relation to health and safety conditions in the industry or the planning and environmental implications of planned construction, emissions and the transport operations associated with the manufacture of cement, are all radically different from the regime instituted under the Cement Acts. The operation of a plant for the production of cement requires an integrated pollution control licence under the Environmental Protection Agency Act. All such plants must comply with the agency's guidelines on various issues, including noise, dust, air emissions and water. A far wider and more effective range of planning and protective measures is now in place to cover cement manufacturing than was <Col N="766" /> envisaged in the licensing provisions which apply under the Cement Acts.</P>
    <P>In the past, the relatively small size of the cement market and the fact that the sole cement manufacturer in this State was capable of catering for the market, may have proved a major factor in the retention of the Cement Acts. Their removal from the Statute Book serves as a signal of the Government's commitment to improving competitiveness and eschewing unnecessary regulation. At present, at least two new investors have already advanced proposals to establish cement manufacturing plants at various locations in the State. In so far as this Bill does away with the licensing requirement for cement manufacturing, it will be of benefit to those investors also.</P>
    <P>The emergence of new cement manufacturing companies will, I expect, make for a more competitive market throughout Ireland. In such circumstances, individual manufacturers will need to increase their competitiveness and explore opportunities for export. The move towards a more competitive market will be driven by market forces and should no longer be inhibited by unnecessary regulatory controls.</P>
    <P>I request Dáil Éireann to approve the Second Stage of this Bill, repealing the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962, thereby removing the requirement that a person who wishes to manufacture cement must obtain a licence from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The enactment of this Bill will not give rise to any direct cost to the Exchequer and will not have any significant implications for the economy. I trust this is to the satisfaction of the Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to repeal the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962. The principal provision of the Cement Acts is that a company cannot manufacture cement without a licence from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is important that we are changing this. The legislation facilitated the establishment of an indigenous manufacturing base for the production of cement. The repeal of the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962, is proposed on the grounds that the industry is operating successfully, given the current economic boom and unprecedented growth, and the need for regulation has become redundant. It is important to have competition in the industry.</P>
      <P>The Cement Acts bestowed a uniquely favourable position on Cement Limited, by granting a cement manufacturing licence to it in 1933 which ensured its monopoly status in cement manufacturing in the Republic to this day. It is clear that, from the inception of the Cement Act, the intention of the State was to assist in the creation of an efficient indigenous cement industry. It is also clear that Cement Limited was not to enjoy super normal profits as a result of its cement monopoly, which apparently was the case. CRH incorporated many companies and had a unique monopoly in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> In 1969 Roadstone took over Cement Limited and is now Cement Roadstone Holdings Limited. CRH went on to control the Irish market for industrial explosives, a key ingredient in the production of aggregates, by taking effective control of Irish Industrial Explosives, the monopoly producer and supplier of explosives in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the mid-1980s the Government again stepped in to enhance the dominant position of CRH by introducing the cement certification scheme. This scheme, although introduced by the Government, clearly breached the Treaty of Rome, as it had the effect of eliminating and-or preventing competition in the cement market, to the detriment of concrete producers and the public. The European Commission had established that this was a barrier to trade.</P>
    <P>In 1991, CRH purchased Glen Ding through a secret sale of this reserve by the State. The price paid by CRH for the Glen Ding reserve and its freehold was a tiny fraction of its worth. CRH had an immensely dominant position in the market for aggregates. It should have been specifically excluded from purchasing Glen Ding, rather than being specifically favoured with its purchase.</P>
    <P>In 1985 there was an agreement between CRH and the ESB for the purchase of PFA. The State, through the Competition Authority, permitted the signing of an agreement between CRH and the ESB which allowed CRH to purchase PFA &ndash; pulverised fuel ash &ndash; from the ESB. Logistically, this agreement has had the effect of exclusivity. PFA is a waste product produced by the ESB at Moneypoint, which can be used as a substitute for up to 35% of cement usage. Rather than ensuring the PFA was sold to independent concrete producers, where part of its cost savings could be passed on to consumers, CRH was favoured with being allowed to absorb what would normally have been a competing product. This was a fundamentally flawed decision on the part of the previous Competition Authority and gave a unique opportunity to CRH.</P>
    <P>The issue of the Greencore quarries arose in 1996, when CRH, which already held an immensely dominant position in the market for aggregates in the State, was allowed to take over the sugar company quarries without any reference to the Competition Authority or declaration of its existing dominant position in the market for aggregates. The Barley Hill and Mount Nugent quarries also originally belonged to Irish Sugar but were sold to CRH in the early 1980s. When added to CRH's existing lime capacity at Trim, County Meath, and its subsequent takeover of Stoneford lime quarries in Duleek, County Meath, this gave CRH a virtual monopoly in the production of agricultural ground limestone in the Leinster region. This dominance in ground lime has spread throughout the Republic through an incessant policy of takeovers, both hidden and transparent, once again giving CRH a dominant position in yet another market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> It is important to have competition in every industry. There was an exclusive market in cement, which is a vastly profitable business, and small quarries were bought out because they could not get the aggregate ingredient to make cement. CRH has also secured a dominant or monopoly position in the Republic in the highly lucrative markets for superfines for fertilisers, animal feedstuffs, etc, mainly through the acquisition of Milverton Quarries, Skerries, in the 1980s and the recent acquisition of Castlemore Quarries in Cork. This market sector, although much smaller in terms of volume, is known to be one of the most lucrative divisions within the CRH group.</P>
    <P>Dolomitic limestone is a scheduled mineral under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, and is quarried predominantly for ground limestone with State mining leases, and in the knowledge of the Geological Survey of Ireland and the exploration and mining division of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. There is currently one mining lease for dolomite-dolomitic limestone. This was obtained in 1969 by Pfizer Chemicals, which is now operated by CRH, which pays a royalty on material used in the high value fertiliser market only. CRH operates other similar reserves without a licence and, apparently, without a demand for royalties. This contrasts greatly with one independent operator we know who has been unfairly levied with massive royalty demands from the exploration and mining division.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to repeal the monopoly provided for in the Cement Acts, 1933 to 1962. CRH had a huge monopoly for a long time and dominated the market. It was a one family business throughout the State. There were acquisitions of title, but by and large the majority shareholder was CRH.</P>
    <P>This legislation will encourage fair competition. If one company has a monopoly on the manufacture of aggregates, that is, the components to make cement, it will be a closed shop. No doubt it is an expensive business to develop, but the objective should be to introduce competition. In the new millennium there is unprecedented demand in the housing market and this will continue in the next five years. While we are all aware of the price of houses and the margin of profit of developers, we should be aware of the costs of production. The market is being manipulated by developers and suppliers to the trades. The consumers, that is, the young couple buying a home, are paying prices which are three and four times the cost of production. There is a cost of product and an operating margin of profit in any business, but whether it is cement or the provision of houses which follows on from that, it is unbelievable that people can make profits of 300% and 400%.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State the construction industry has been dominated by one major player in the cement business, that is, CRH. A new alliance of smaller players in the market has <Col N="769" /> been formed and it is important they it should get assistance in order to be in a position to offer competition. It is in the interests of the consumer that the cartel, which was clearly evident from the manufacturer of cement down to the developer carrying out the work, is broken.</P>
    <P>The continuation of a licensing regime is unnecessary and may have had the effect of discouraging or eliminating competition. There are two major players, but the Government is clearly establishing that it welcomes competition. If there are secret acquisitions being made or the larger player is buying out a smaller company, this is not seen in the public domain, although obviously the Companies Registration Office would be notified of the change of ownership. When a company has a limitless chequebook, it is hard for a smaller player to resist.</P>
    <P>If there is a monopoly in any business, be it retailing or anything else, it is the consumer who will lose. The operation of free trade, which is not anti-competitive, is important. We all heard the debate about the grocery order. The Competition Authority found that the grocery order was anti-competitive. For an authority with few resources, it spent a huge amount of time analysing that market. If it had done a study on the cement market, I am quite certain it would have seen anomalies in the dominance of one major supplier in the trade.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the Short Title and the commencement of the Act. The Bill does not have any financial implications, but it is important that there is a level playing field and that people who are hoping to get into the market should be able to do so without having to go through rigorous dated legislation to acquire a licence to manufacture.</P>
    <P>In 1969, Roadstone took over Cement Limited and became Cement Roadstone Holdings Limited. Explosives are a key ingredient in the production of aggregates and CRH took effective control of Irish Industrial Explosives. It is important that under the Bill the new companies coming into the market will have access to this monopolised market controlled by an existing company. A new company entering the market should have access to the ingredient dolomitic limestone. Companies should have access to the markets in aggregates and fertilisers also, and there should not be a monopoly in those markets.</P>
    <P>The company has held a monopoly for 66 years. It is outrageous. The Acts bestowed a uniquely favourable position on Cement Limited by granting a cement manufacturing licence for that period. Cement Limited is still the only entity producing cement in the State. This would indicate the power of the company and the effectiveness of the Act. I am astonished that these Acts have not been amended before now, but I suppose it is better late than never. The legislation will be important in the future.</P>
    <P>Last week I saw a case in Sligo where a house, which was £65,000 18 months ago, was sold for £125,000. The market has been affected by devel<Col N="770" /> opers and property speculators. It is important that people should be aware of the cost of building a house. If a person is building a house of 2,500 sq. ft. or 3,000 sq. ft., the cost of product should be clear in order to establish the level of profits. Under the Insurance Bill, 1999, the level of commission must be included in a policy in order that people will see how much they are paying in commission. Likewise, it is important that a person buying a house can see clearly how much profit the developer has made. It should be easy to benchmark the level of profit which a developer has made on a given estate. That information should come into the public domain. People are becoming very selfish. They are not happy taking 25% or 30%; they want 200% or 300% profits. There was a monopoly in the cement industry and equally there is a cartel in the housing market in most counties. It is hard to change that. In most counties the housing market is controlled by three or four people. They were quite happy with the way it was. They could well afford to pay inflated prices, if that was the case, because the consumer was paying quadruple the price on purchasing that home.</P>
    <P>We welcome competition. I am not an expert on the detail of this complex issue. It is very important that new companies enter the market and that those which are dominant in the market do not control supply totally. If CRH has a monopoly in the supply of components for making cement, new companies will find it very difficult to establish themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important Bill and I hope that ultimately the consumer will gain through a free and competitive market in terms of the supply of cement. There is no point in making developers richer by providing cheaper cement. It is very important that the beneficiaries will be those purchasing homes, but regrettably that is not the case. Last week a constituent came to my office who is paying £700 per month for rented accommodation. She looked at a home which would cost £110,000, but was unable to get a mortgage on her income. Some years ago repayments of £700 would have serviced a substantial mortgage. However, one must now pay between £1,100 and £1,200 per month to service a mortgage of £110,000 or £120,000. This is a clear problem. A new poor is emerging despite the economic boom.</P>
    <P>Last week I spoke to an auctioneer who said his biggest problem was that when he tells a client who is looking for £100,000 for his house that he has found a buyer, the client says he will wait longer and asks the auctioneer to increase the price to £125,000. Everybody is going for the last pound. Despite the boom in the economy a vast number of people will not be able to afford a mortgage.</P>
    <P>Repealing the cement enactments is very welcome because they guaranteed a monopoly to one dominant player in the market since 1933. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure there is transparency in the market so that there is a defi<Col N="771" /> nite price per square foot, be it £25 or £30, for each development. This must be benchmarked in future in terms of affordable housing.</P>
    <P>In a very worthwhile initiative local authorities in each development are now costing the site and the houses and are assessing people whose incomes are under £20,000 to see if they can afford to buy such houses. Such an approach is very important in every development, not just in terms of local authority housing. Developers are getting richer and are making millions of pounds on the backs of building societies. Building societies are dishing out not only two and half but three times people's salaries. They are not even looking for P60s &ndash; all they are seeking is a certification of income on which any figure can be inserted. I know regulation is being introduced, and that is very important. Consumers are very anxious to get a mortgage and more often than not they will come up with the necessary documentation.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are creeping upwards again. People are saying that interest rates are low, but regardless of interest rates people forget that the principal must be repaid and I think this is where the real problem will lie. Apart from interest people are paying huge amounts of their income repaying the principal and this is very much related to transparency in the market.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to cement and related concrete products, the major ingredients in house building. It is a vast industry and the competition being provided for will bring benefits, not only to other companies which in turn could become monopolies, but to our constituents who are hoping to buy homes. The Bill should not allow more people to make further millions of pounds. There should be transparency in the market in terms of the cost of product and the cost of building a house should be widely known. I am quite certain the Department can provide benchmarks in this regard. The Minister will introduce legislation whereby brokers will have to declare their commission, for example, of £25 on a car insurance policy, and it is very important that the net profit on developments is clearly evident and properly audited to see if it is justifiable. If excessive profits are made then developers should be taxed accordingly. This would help home purchasers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on the Bill and hope that the beneficiaries will be the consumers.</P>

      <P>This is the second short Bill published by the Department in the past two weeks which does not amount to a hill of beans. The Bill is of little consequence and does no more than remove from the Statute Book legislation which is redundant, although that is to be welcomed. It should also be welcomed in so far as it sends out a signal in terms of competition in an important industry. However, the Minister of State in his speech said:</P>

    <P>The original legislation has been largely unused for over 20 years. The purpose of the <Col N="772" /> Bill, therefore, is to remove a piece of redundant legislation from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it does not seem that the Bill will make much difference. I would like him to elaborate on this point. What does he mean when he says it has been unused for 20 years? Were there applications over that period for licences from other companies to enter the market? I am not sure what is meant by unused. I understand what is meant when the Minister of State says the legislation is redundant, although if the legislation is still on the Statute Book I would have thought it was still mandatory on prospective manufacturers of cement to seek a licence. In that sense the legislation is not redundant. Does he mean it has had no practical effect in the marketplace? I am not sure, but I hope he is. I welcome the Bill in so far as it is desirable to remove redundant legislation from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>We could have a wide-ranging debate on the nature of competition and its absence for so many years in this area. From the debate in the Seanad I recall there was a wide-ranging debate which was not always relevant to the Bill. There was a very interesting discourse on the nature of the CRH monopoly and the manner in which senior people in CRH interact with other leading companies, especially the financial institutions. That is a very interesting debate but I am not sure it has much to do with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course, the incestuous interaction of a small number of senior industrialists who pop up in all the main places, be it on the boards of the banks or leading industrial holding companies, is a phenomenon which is not healthy. Presumably, it has something to do with the smallness of our society and economy and it has taken on another character because of recent revelations and inquiries in which the Minister of State's Department is engaged. I am not sure it has a great deal to do with this legislation and I do not purport to go down that road.</P>
    <P>I recall, however, that people who wanted to enter this industry made representations to me on a number of occasions over the years but they felt that monopoly power was used to suppress their ability to enter the market. They have not made contact with me since the Bill was published. I have had no discussion with them and my memory is unreliable but I am sure the Minister of State is aware of who the people concerned are. They feel very hard done by.</P>
    <P>I saw a further reference to a High Court case in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Friday, 14 April. It stated:</P>
    <P>A High Court judge yesterday said that evidence before him had established that, far from coming to court with &ldquo;clean hands&rdquo;, the cement manufacturing firm, Sean Quinn Group Ltd., was involved in &ldquo;doubtful practices&rdquo; regarding an application by another company to establish a £40 million (51 million) cement facility near Kinnegad.</P>
    <P>Mr Justice Quirke said the group had made &ldquo;surreptitious&rdquo; payments worth £30,000 to a <Col N="773" /> residents' group opposed to the Kinnegad development.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and his officials are also familiar with that case. Murky practices seem to go on in the industry. It seems extraordinary that a company which applied to open a cement facility at that location was engaged in funding protesters under the counter. To some extent that has characterised parts of this industry down through the years. Will the Minister of State respond specifically on that? He stated that the legislation is redundant and has had no relevance for 20 years. Is he saying that it was easy for outsiders to enter this market over that period? Were there obstacles? What does he know about the case I mentioned, for example? It is important that we hear about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not provide figures on the usage of cement in this economy over recent years but, obviously, as Deputy Perry said, it must have been a major increasing factor in recent years, given the boom in the house building sector, the expenditure of EU Structural Funds and so on. As I understand it, CRH has 80% market share, which is manifestly a dominant position. No Irish law prevents a dominant position but there is one which is supposed to prevent abuse of dominant position. They are two different concepts and it is possible to be in a dominant position in this economy without transgressing the law and, arguably, without engaging in anti-competitive practices in terms of preventing entry to the market of other players. Sean Quinn Group Ltd. has 15% of the market and the remaining 5% of the market comprises imports. I would like the Minister of State to outline who has tried to enter the market in recent years or who has made application to his Department for a licence.</P>
    <P>What has prompted the legislation? There must be many Acts on the Statute Book which are redundant and which should be repealed. Deputy Owen and I completed deliberations on Committee Stage of the Copyright Bill, 1999, yesterday at the Oireachtas Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. The purpose of the final amendment to the Bill, which was mine, was to remove the Copyright Act, 1963, from the Statute Book because only one small section of it remains extant. My amendment intended to insert that section in the new legislation and repeal the Copyright Act, 1963. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, could not tell us why he would not do that except to say that his way was better than mine and he is the Minister of State, and since I am in Opposition he wins the argument. He has more Members to support him for the moment anyway. What has prompted the Minister of State in this instance to take action to remove redundant legislation from the Statute Book but not to do so in other areas?</P>
    <P>We are dealing with legislation that is an anachronistic hangover from the era of protectionism. It was considered appropriate in the <Col N="774" /> 1930s that we ought to build a protectionist economy, behind which we could shelter from the winds of free trade and in the process develop strong indigenous industries behind that barrier. It is one of the great tragedies of our economic history that that policy prevailed for as long as it did. The former Taoiseach, Séan Lemass, who introduced this legislation in the 1930s, was also the man who started to dismantle the protectionist economy and it was also a tragedy for the generations of young people who were forced out of Ireland because they could not obtain employment that Mr. Lemass did not come to power in 1948 rather than in 1959. The period 1948-59 was a lifetime in the history of people from my part of the country and that of the Minister of State. They had to go to England and the United States to make a living because the protectionist economy was an endemic failure as employment was not created.</P>
    <P>It seems we are dealing with legislation from that era which has long since had no relevance. We are removing it from the Statute Book but I am not sure about making claims for it beyond that. It is useful but it does not send much of a signal about competition. There are a few prospective new entrants to the market. How many applications does the Minister of State have to hand? I do not know what their relationship with him has been up to now. It is pity we do not have figures for expenditure on cement over recent years. The other main factor in the industry is price and Ireland is the fifth most expensive cement producer in the EU &ndash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong. That is quite material. I do not know whether economic studies have been carried out in terms of what contribution the lack of competition has made to that statistic.</P>
    <P>Against a background of a £40 billion investment in infrastructure and EU Structural Fund programmes, the spend on cement must be enormous. For one company to have 80 per cent of that market is unhealthy. I would, however, be interested to hear from the Minister how that is likely to change. The cement manufacturer Quinn was shut down and started to manufacture on the other side of the Border. That company is now seeking permission to open a plant in County Cavan. The Minister should be frank about the casualties which have resulted from this monopoly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry spent some time dealing with house building. Obviously that is a major issue confronting society and he took a more optimistic view than I do. This Government will not take on the builders' cartel. In this quiet Chamber one can hear the thunder claps from Dublin Castle which signify that the Minister and his party will not take on the builders. The situation is grossly exploitative at the moment in terms of the average young person trying to buy a house, there is a psychosis in the housing market.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that the big five auctioneering companies in this city are also contributing to the current problems. There is an unhealthy arrange<Col N="775" /> ment between them and the property pages of the newspapers which must be examined. There is a psychosis designed to drive up the prices beyond the reach of ordinary people because of the imbalance between supply and demand. Perhaps the Government will tackle the cartel but what basis have we to believe it will? It has done nothing in three years. The perfectly groomed Minister for the Environment and Local Government hides behind Mr. Bacon and tampers at the edges but the price rises continue. The best we can be told is that there is now a slowing down of the rate of acceleration of increases. It is extraordinary that young couples whose own parents could secure a mortgage are now denied access to home ownership because they cannot afford a mortgage.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his Department wanted to make a fuss about repealing the legislation he could have given the House an economic assessment of the contribution the absence of competition in this industry has made to the phenomenon of spiralling house prices. There is no point coming in with the anodyne script the Minister read; there was nothing in it. It told us that the Act was brought in by Seán Lemass in the 1930s and it is now being repealed, that it has been irrelevant for 20 years and that the Government is committed to competition, apple pie, motherhood and whatever you are having yourself. The House deserves, if precious legislative time is to be devoted to a Bill like this, some economic presentation of its implications, otherwise it has no meaning.</P>
    <P>Would I be right in saying that even though the requirement for a licence to manufacture cement is being abolished in this Bill, there is still a requirement to get a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency? Pollution is one of the major factors in the manufacture of cement. It would require a major investment to comply with proper standards in that area. That must also be a barrier for new entrants, the costs must be huge. If we are repealing this, will the Environmental Protection Agency continue to have a role? I am aware that when this legislation was enacted and for many years after there was no planning legislation worth talking about. There is planning legislation now, however, to cope with new entrants.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more competition in this market. If we do see it, it will because of the state of economic activity rather than the repeal of this legislation. If I was to consider opening a cement plant today and I had to apply to the Department for a licence, I would get one. That brings me back to the relevance of this Bill. Is it internal housekeeping? If so, that is fine but it does not go any further.</P>
    <P>We have not straightened out our view of competition. There are areas which readily come to mind. Deputy Perry expressed a view on the situation obtaining in the grocery trade in respect of the groceries order. Equally the situations with <Col N="776" /> pubs or taxis could be examined. One issue which should be of major concern to this House is the newspaper industry. Talking about newspapers is a delicate matter for politicians because the newspapers are oxygen for them and, therefore, there is a feeling that one should turn a blind eye to practices in that industry. It is worrying that in a democracy there is such a concentration of ownership of the print media. So long as the owners of the dominant position are favourable to the Government and help them to get elected, I do not suppose they will do anything about it but it is unhealthy that it should be allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The current role of the National Centre for Partnership, as described in Partnership 2000, is the promotion of the partnership approach in both the public and private sectors through the organisation and facilitation of seminars, workshops and training programmes. <Col N="777" /> The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, recognising the progress which has been made, proposes a new approach signalled by a new title and role for the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP). It is envisaged that the centre will work with IBEC and ICTU in supporting the deepening of partnership including, through deliberation, consensus-building and dissemination, monitoring, research and analysis, and training and facilitation.</P>
      <P>This will enable the centre to contribute to more effectively tackling the challenges of ensuring that enterprises, both public and private, are better equipped to adapt to change, including new forms of work organisation, underpinned by effective arrangements of lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to initiate discussions with IBEC and ICTU on the detailed arrangements now that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been ratified.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the arrangements for the National Centre for Partnership to work in the public sector? In this context will the public sector include organisations in State ownership, such as CIE, which is in grave need of improvement in the partnership approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that organisation and others will be included in the new arrangements but the details of how they will operate have yet to be worked out. It will work in the same building as NESC and NESF. It has done very good work in the past two years but it was felt by the social partners that that could be extended, as I have outlined in the reply. The centre will now be able to implement the partnership approach in various bodies, as Deputy Bruton has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the programme, the reference to the public service specifically excludes commercial State-sponsored bodies? If the public service arrangements for co-operation with the National Centre for Partnership exclude bodies like CIE, what arrangements would include CIE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE was probably discussed in the talks more than any other body. The arrangements with both IBEC and ICTU will enable the centre to contribute to more effective tackling of challenges and to ensuring that enterprises both public and private can work better. The question of CIE was raised. However, there has to be agreement between IBEC and ICTU and the Government before they can go into any organisation. It happens that it was CIE which was discussed in the course of the talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed in the talks, because of time constraints, that the details of how the arrangements will operate will have to <Col N="778" /> be worked out. The question of CIE was raised. However, the social partners would not agree to any initiative in any organisation until a framework is agreed. That will be done. The social partners are conscious of the needs in CIE, and the Government is anxious that it should be involved. If we are to promote partnership arrangements and restructuring, that has to be done in the context of partnership. The details will be worked out. I have no problem with the details being discussed. That is what was agreed. However, CIE was an obvious example which was raised in the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in what was raised. I am interested in what was agreed or not agreed. Why was agreement not reached on an arrangement for CIE to be involved in the operations of the National Centre of Partnership? Is this not an important enough issue for the Government to have sought to have agreed as part of the programme? Why was this postponed in view of the appalling state of industrial relations in CIE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will restate what I have already said. Time did not allow for working out the framework for involvement in various areas. Until that is worked out, the social partners would be reluctant to sign their names to it. However, they have agreed that as soon as the programme is finished they will work out the details. That will now be done as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically three months were spent on the entire negotiations which covered hundreds of issues. Arrangements were made for an extension of the remit of the National Centre for Partnership. It was agreed that it would be involved in public private partnerships. It was agreed what kinds of areas it would extend into. It is a national agreement and, having negotiated four such agreements, I know it is not possible to tie down every little bit in the overall negotiations. However, that will be done in working out the detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that this far from a little bit. Anybody who is not well off has to rely on CIE as their means of getting around. It provides bus and train services. Its industrial relations record is dreadful and services have been interrupted. Any Government with eyes and ears could see and hear that there is a necessity for an improved partnership arrangement in CIE, yet the Government spent three months negotiating an agreement with the unions and employers and failed to nail down an arrangement for introducing special partnership arrangements in its own company, CIE, which <Col N="779" /> partnership arrangements it was preaching at everybody else. Surely the Government, which owns CIE, should be setting an example in introducing partnership structures rather than preaching at other people and failing, on the entirely spurious grounds of lack of time, given that the Taoiseach has admitted he had three months to deal with this and to deal with the issue of introducing a proper arrangement in CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to range widely because there are many important questions to be answered. The National Centre for Partnership has changed its remit. That has been agreed in negotiations. The areas to be looked at have been agreed in negotiations. The final details will be subject to further discussion. If the Deputy wants to pursue details about CIE and proposals that were made yesterday and other things which I think he is getting at, he should put down a separate question.</P>

It recommends a change management group to look at all aspects of the office and recommends proposals to improve communication with Departments. It <Col N="781" /> highlights deficiencies and then puts together the areas which should be remedied. It goes into great detail, from filing systems to technology systems to training systems.

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that he has ministerial responsibility to the Dáil for both the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor's Office? Does he accept the CSSO has found that there was no consistency in the provision of directives from the DPP's office and in the case of files provided by the DPP's office case references and case law were not always quoted when they should have been? Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a requirement of accountability for such an administrative lapse and if this lapse had occurred when Deputy Owen was Minister for Justice he and his colleagues would have been screaming blue murder? We have a report that condemns failures in two offices for which the Taoiseach has ministerial responsibility and he is seeking to pass it away in a welter of managerial gobbledygook and evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept that from Deputy Bruton. I will tell him the summary of the recommendations in the report. It will take some time but if that is the way we are to answer questions we will do so.</P>
      <P>It recommends that a change management group that has the confidence and co-operation of management and staff be established. The group will oversee the implementation of all recommendations contained in the report. It will serve as a mechanism to drive change and encourage staff participation in the process. It will continue to manage further change after the current work management project has been completed. The functions of the change management group have been incorporated into the partnership committee. The recommendations in the report are constantly under discussion and are being implemented appropriately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recommended that an efficient system be implemented for the opening of all incoming correspondence, including electronic mail and faxes. The system should ensure that all incoming items are examined, addressed to the correct officer, logged on a computer system and delivered to the sections as quickly as possible. As part of this implementation, the feasibility of subscribing to the Dublin Document Exchange service and of receiving faxes directly on computers should be investigated. Discussions should be held with the Attorney General's office in order to learn from its experience in this area. A facility is being put in place under direction of my office allowing all staff to send electronic mail and faxes from their desktop computer. It is expected that negotiations will commence very shortly on the instal<Col N="782" /> lation of file and case tracking systems. Active discussions are taking place with the Dublin Document Exchange with a view to subscribing to its services in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is recommended that secretarial support teams comprising current clerical staff and typists redeployed from the typing section be set up within the sections. All the staff on these teams would carry out a range of clerical duties. The arrangement would fit well with the work management system in that clerical and legal staff in the sections would be working together and sharing information in a more organised way. Each team will have a staff officer who will be responsible for staff supervision and for helping to manage the clerical workload in co-operation with the head of section and the rest of the team.</P>
    <P>The secretarial support teams will have wide implications for the staff. A sub-group is to be set up reporting to the change management group to make proposals on their formation. The sub-group is to investigate current volumes of work, staff levels, accommodation and predicted future trends. It should also take into account any concerns raised by staff that have been mentioned in the report. The proposals are to include the make-up of the teams for each section and the procedures that should be followed to ensure smooth day to day running of the teams. Provision for the efficient preparation of the books of evidence are to be included in the arrangement.</P>
    <P>Under the current structure of the office it is not feasible to make the changes recommended in the report. However, as soon as the recommendations of the Nally report are implemented and the staff currently dealing with crime is transferred to the DPP's office, the recommendations set out in that section dealing with secretarial staff will be fully implemented.</P>
    <P>On the filing and archiving systems, it is recommended that a good manual filing system be set up with the procedural changes and computer systems to support it. Procedures on the correct method of handling files from the beginning of a case onwards should be drawn up. It will include protocols for the opening, moving, closing, archiving and destruction of files. Procedures for the storage of files, both live and archived, must be improved. The staff, particularly those in personnel and accounts, are to be acquainted with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and are to ensure that their filing systems are adequate to meet any requests for information under that Act.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in this section are to be addressed when the file case management system is in place. The new larger store room provided in Osmond House will allow them to retain files for longer than they were previously held and allow the requirements of the National Archives Act to be fully implemented. The staff in personnel and accounts are to be familiar with the Freedom of Information Act and all the personnel files have been centralised to comply with the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> On management and human resource issues, the management should consult more with staff when drawing up management plans. The management should meet regularly with all the section heads who should give feedback to staff from these meetings at their individual section meetings. Management at all levels, following this report, are encouraged to make the best use of the technology at their disposal and make sure they are kept up to date with new developments and be aware of the potential benefits of&mdash;</P>

I presume the report is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> He did not address the issue of staffing and staff vacancies in the Chief State Solicitor's office which is a matter of concern that has been raised publicly on previous occasions. In his extensive briefing is there any reference to the problem of staff vacancies and the possibility of emulating the National Treasury Management Agency in terms of contracting in solicitors to do the work because market forces and prevailing salary rates effectively prevent the recruitment of solicitors and if they are recruited, they are quickly attracted out of there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations on staff are proceeding. The strike action has ceased. They involve IMPACT, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office and, hopefully, they will be completed. The staffing issue continues to be a difficulty. Some staff have been contracted in. In all there are 223 staff. Most of the vacancies have been filled. It is inevitable from the discussions that more staff will be required and they would prefer to have full-time staff. I hope that will be the outcome of the negotiations if it is possible to recruit them. There could also be some contract staff.</P>
      <P>In regard to implementation, the matters mentioned and many others, which are by and large administrative issues and of which there are many, it is difficult to understand why many of these things have not been done in the past. In fairness to the staff its workload has grown enormously complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. The volume of work is creating enormous difficulties for them. The reason there is such attention to detail is to get best practice. While much of this report has been implemented much remains to be implemented. A major part of the difficulty is the deficiencies in communication between the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, even though they are all complex.</P>
      <P>The following steps have been taken, to mention but four or five &ndash; solicitors in the office have been instructed to become familiar with and draw attention to the directions issued by the DPP's office on every occasion when counsel is briefed or asked to advise on proofs&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a mess, rather the volume of work is growing at an extraordinary pace. The office has prepared three huge reports. In 1996 there was the Deloitte and Touche report, every recommendation of which, bar very small issues, have been implemented. The Nally report which is being implemented includes a recommendation to move the prosecution section to the DPP's office. The report, which this question is about, is not about those matters. Rather it deals with the clerical, administrative and management issues of the office, all of which are being implemented. The Deputy asked, which is a different question, about the volume of work in the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the volume will increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and hope the staffing element responds to that. The Deputy is aware of the cases with which sections of the office are involved. This work will increase. This is its third report in four years. It has received an enormous amount of extra staff and resources. I am sure that in the ongoing discussions there will be more issues concerning staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, accept that the biggest financial hit the economy has repeatedly received in the past ten years has been litigation based on civil negligence of arms or Departments of Government and that the unique funnel through which all of those actions are initiated and processed is through the Chief State Solicitor's office, As a result of that succession of financial hits we are bleeding billions in taxpayers' money. Will he accept there is a critical need to resolve the problems and to resource the Chief State Solicitor's office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The volume of work in the past year has increased because the civil cases are going on much longer, three years, and staff are <Col N="786" /> tied up in those cases. The office would prefer if the same person could deal with the case right through but that is not possible. Enormous resources would be required to do that. While it has increased its staff from 150 to 223 or 233 and will move further, the volume of work has increased the pressure. The office is making efforts in the talks with the trade union representatives, in trying to use technology in administration and in trying to hold on to good staff. The office is doing its utmost in that regard and will have to continue to do so. It is not right, and staff have made it clear, but we have to continue to try to implement the public prosecutions system and study the Nally report and this report on administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revised Estimates for Public Services, which were published on 22 March, set out the provisional outturn for 1999 expenditure and the estimate for 2000 expenditure for my Department. The provisional outturn of £19.8 million for 1999 shows that my Department was well within its overall budget for the year, with savings on a number of subheads. In the cases of millennium celebrations and the Moriarty tribunal, some expenditure was deferred to this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the millennium, expenditure in 1999 was lower than was originally anticipated, mainly because there is a significant capital element involved. There is a longer lead time on capital projects and the millennium office ensures that grants are not made until satisfactory progress has been made on such projects. With regard to the Moriarty tribunal, the ongoing work of the tribunal has meant that the bulk of the legal costs, which will arise following completion of that work, have not yet arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revised Estimate for 2000 for my Department is £85.294 million. This is an increase of £48.908 million on the Abridged Estimate, which was published last November. The increase arises for the following reasons. The administrative budget has increased to reflect the carry-forward of savings which my Department made in 1999. Subheads which include a pay component have been adjusted to take account of the increases agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The allocation for grants under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, has been increased by £150,000, the additional allocation represents expenditure deferred from 1999. The allocation for commemoration initiatives has increased by £70,000 to reflect an additional allocation made by the Minister for Finance in the <Col N="787" /> context of the budget. The allocation for the millennium celebrations has been increased to £23.2 million &ndash; this represents the balance of the £30 million allocation made by the Government to cover the years 1999 to 2000. A sum of £300,000 has been allocated to a new subhead which will cover the administration and other costs of the independent commission of inquiry being undertaken by former Chief Justice Hamilton into the bombings in Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk. A sum of £31 million has been allocated for multi-media developments, including the development of a new research and development institution, MediaLab Europe, and a multi-media village in Dublin and £10 million has been allocated for the initial development costs of Sports Campus Ireland.</P>

The feasibility study was paid for from last year's Estimate but there will be expenditure this year. There will also be staff costs.</P>

      <P>By coincidence, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton and I are all former Ministers for Finance. Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a well established practice that contingency funds amount to no more than £1,000 in a budget. This is a device to signal in advance that an unquantified amount of money will be expended but until the precise figure is available no figure greater than the nominal one of £1,000 is written into the Estimate. These are the Estimates for the Department of the Taoiseach and not for the Office of Public of Works or the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. People in the Taoiseach's Department would have had to present an argument for the figure of £10 million if it were not a contingency sum. The Taoiseach has confirmed that this is a contingency sum. Will the Taoiseach answer the question if he can or come back to the House if he cannot? Of what does the figure of <Col N="789" /> £10 million consist? It would not have gone through the Department of Finance unless the Taoiseach's Department had substantiated it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim from the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland for a 30% increase in salaries and allowances for teachers was lodged with the Teachers Conciliation Council on 13 March. As claims before the council are a matter solely for the council I do not propose to make a statement on this issue at this time. The full terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness are on offer to the ASTI.</P>
      <P>The Government has made its position clear on the issue of special claims generally. As the Taoiseach emphasised recently at the Irish Institute of Management conference, adherence to the letter and spirit of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is vital. The programme contains new and innovative proposals for the introduction of a comprehensive system of benchmarking of public service salaries and jobs, internally in the public service and across the economy. These proposals provide an excellent opportunity for public servants, including teachers, to have their roles, responsibilities and remuneration examined and adjudicated on by a professional and independent body during the course of the programme. I understand discussions have begun with the public service committee of the ICTU on the establishment of the benchmarking body as provided for in the programme.</P>

      <P>The ASTI is going through the procedures and will report formally to the Teachers Conciliation Council on its position in due course. I would not like to speculate on the outcome of its deliberations on the course it should take. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the establishment of a benchmarking body to examine public service pay and jobs, that is to say, it will examine existing roles, duties and responsibilities attaching to a particular group or profession. It will be entirely independent in its work. The question of how it will do its work is one for determination by the body itself but it will no doubt involve an initial input by employers and trade unions followed by the necessary research arranged by the body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Paper on Adult Education points to the fragmented nature of adult education and the wide range of services encompassed within that term. In the education sector this includes programmes for early school leavers, such as Youthreach and <Col N="796" /> Traveller training centres, the vocational training opportunity scheme, post-leaving certificate courses and adult literacy and community education programmes.</P>
      <P>A major proportion of the staff concerned have formal teaching qualifications. As regards the remainder, nationally accredited certificate and diploma programmes have been commissioned by my Department on an in-service basis and funds are provided towards fees to encourage participation of those who do not have formal qualifications. The courses concerned include programmes in adult and community education or vocational education and training in the NUI colleges in Galway and Maynooth, in the University of Limerick and in Dublin City University, and programmes for staff in the adult literacy service in Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Recognition in the form of additional allowances for such qualifications have been introduced as part of the recent restructuring of pay and conditions for staff in Youthreach and senior Traveller training centres. This area will be further progressed in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Adult Education and in light of developments under the national qualifications framework. Given the diffused range of interests involved in the sector and the implications for providers across the education and training sectors, it will be essential to progress this work on a phased basis, underpinned by an inclusive participative consultation process, systematic research and a review of best international practice in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his definition of adult education and the recognition of its diversity. The Green Paper states that all those involved in delivering adult education should ultimately have third level qualifications and training. What plans does the Minister of State have to ensure this will happen and what is the expected timeframe? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither I nor the Government has any intention of ensuring that all those involved in delivering adult education will have third level training. The difficulty is that a number of people teaching in this sector, particularly in the area of literacy, have vast experience from having learned on the job. The recommendation is that whatever qualification they will ultimately be given will be at third level. However, that does not mean they must formally go through a third level training programme like someone doing a degree in a university.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper proposed the setting up of an inter-agency group on the professional qualifications we give to and recognise for adult educators. We have the mechanism in place to put that committee into operation. The White Paper will be published in the next few weeks and, as soon as that happens, we will put the inter-agency group in place. I will instruct it to report within a finite time period.</P>

I have no idea of the overall figures and what will ultimately be needed or how many people will get involved. The Government will put a programme in place as soon as the White Paper is published. We will be ready to commit sufficient funding to ensure this sector is properly catered for. For too long it has been the Cinderella of the education system but we are in the process of changing that.</P>

      <P>I am aware of what is stated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on the development of youth work services, including the funding of the voluntary youth organisations. It is my intention to honour fully the commitments in relation to youth work referred to in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and I will outline for the Deputy some of the developments that are taking place in relation to youth work.</P>
      <P>The financial allocation for the year 2000 for youth work funding, including voluntary youth organisations, is £17.78 million, which is an increase of £2.34 million or 15% over the 1999 provision. This is additional to an increase of £1.5 million given in the 1999 allocation. That is tangible evidence of the Government's commitment to and desire for significant expansion in the provision of youth work programmes and services.</P>
      <P>The following specific measures which are taking place are of particular importance and relevance. The Government gave its approval at yesterday's meeting to the publication of the Youth Work Bill. It will, therefore, be published on the first day of the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy. If his party had done it properly in the first place we would not have to go through it all again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the National Youth Work Advisory Committee to prepare a youth work development plan which will map the way forward for the next five years for the development of youth work services. I have allocated funding to enable consultants to be employed to assist the National <Col N="798" /> Youth Work Advisory Committee in this major undertaking. An allocation of £1 million has been made for the local youth clubs grant scheme in 2000, which is an increase of approximately £600,000 over the 1999 provision. This is an extremely important scheme in that it provides direct financial assistance for local youth clubs and groups, with priority being given to disadvantaged areas. An assessor of youth work will be appointed during the year 2000 and funding has been allocated for that. It is intended that the assessor will formally monitor and assess youth work programmes and services.</P>
    <P>As regards the voluntary youth work organisations directly, the allocations in 2000 will be increased in line with inflation as first phase allocations. The distribution of the balance of the funding available this year will be decided on at a later date after examination of the various proposals received from the organisations in respect of new or expanded youth work activities. I hope to be in a position to indicate the additional funding to be made available to the organisations in June 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the additional allocation in the 15% increase from 1999 is for the development of new services and facilities. I welcome such a measure. However, under the new programme there is a commitment to increase basic pay by 5.5%. Will the Minister of State introduce a Supplementary Estimate to ensure these youth organisations can provide this increase in basic pay for their employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree, therefore, that the 15% increase represents only a 9.5% increase in real terms? If inflation is excluded, the increase is 4% to 5% which is a very small increase in funding for services for young people with such demands placed on them. Under the programme what targets has the Minister of State set in the Department for new services for young people and youth organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's figures are incorrect. When I took office in 1997, the total allocation was £13.345 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>This year it will be £17.78 million which represents an increase of 33% in actual terms during the lifetime of this Administration which is two years and eight months old. If inflation is allowed for, this represents an increase of about 25% in real terms in two and a half years. That is tangible evidence of our commitment to the development and expansion of youth services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as targets are concerned, the national development plan under which I am assisting youth organisations will be available around <Col N="799" /> March or April 2001. The appropriate targets will be included and the Deputy need have no doubts about the Government's commitment to assisting youth organisations meet those targets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State need a lesson in mathematics? Inflation is running at 5%. Is it not the case that, under the new programme, voluntary organisations are committed to increasing basic pay by 5.5%? This brings the total to 10.5% and the total increase for the coming year will be 4.5% for the development of services and facilities. Is this correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened during questions to the Taoiseach and I have to conclude that Fine Gael is scraping the bottom of the barrel. For the past 45 minutes a great deal of rubbish was spoken about the minutia of the Taoiseach's spending programme and we are at it again. If Fine Gael has nothing more constructive to say or nothing more tangible to put across I do not know where it is going as a party. We have increased the provision for youth funding by 25% in real terms for the expansion of services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased allocation for this year is about £2.4 million. Of that sum, £231,000 is allocated for pay increases. The Deputy can work out the figures and he will see we expanded the youth budget substantially in real terms this year and last year. The Government is committed to continuing to do so.</P>
      <P>I took over a service which was grossly under funded by my predecessors. We are still well behind other countries but there is a substantial difference in that the Irish youth service depends on volunteers to a large extent. One cannot compare a system depending largely on volunteers with a professional system. The latter is much more expensive. We have increased funding in real terms by about 25% over the past two and a half years and if one excludes the average rate of inflation the expansion is 25% &ndash; 33 minus eight is 25.</P>

      <P>I do not have full details of the results of the surveys of the English reading achievement of fifth class pupils. A national assessment of English reading was carried out in 1993 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra. A further such survey was conducted in May 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> It is my understanding that the report of the findings of these two surveys is due for delivery in a matter of weeks. I intend to publish the findings. However, I am pleased to provide the Deputy with the following summary of the findings of the 1998 survey.</P>
    <P>Standards of English reading in 1998 were the same as in 1993. Furthermore, although different measuring instruments were used prior to 1993, following a linking exercise with those instruments, it is concluded that standards have not changed since 1980. There has been no change in the performance of low achieving pupils.</P>
    <P>There is great variation in the performance of pupils in fifth class. Teachers rated the reading proficiency of about one in ten pupils as weak-inadequate and an equal number as reading at third class level or lower. More than one in five pupils was regarded as being advanced in reading, while a third were judged to be reading at a class level higher than fifth class.</P>
    <P>In general, boys achieve at a lower level than girls. This was reflected in their performance on the reading assessment instrument as well as in teachers' ratings of their competencies. Pupils' reading achievements are related to a number of personal factors, including time spent in voluntary reading and liking for reading, as well as teachers' assessments of learning related behaviours. Pupils' reading achievements are related to a variety of home-background factors, including the number of books and of study aids, and measures of the educational climate of the home.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Surveys of the English reading achievement of pupils have been conducted since 1972. The main finding of this series of surveys is that since 1980 there has been no significant improvement or disimprovement in pupils' achievements. It is also estimated that about 10% of pupils in fifth class have serious reading difficulties.</P>

Does he further agree that what is needed is a national literacy initiative which goes well beyond the timid initiative announced by his predecessor? As recommended by the INTO, this new initiative should have a national co-ordinating committee and provide significant investment of up to 500 newly trained remedial staff. Does the Minister accept that this is the scale of investment needed to tackle the seriously low literacy levels in primary education?</P>

That is how I am pursuing this issue. Such a high percentage requires a serious approach which is in accordance with what the Deputy is saying.</P>
      <P>Surveys over the years have led to the same conclusion and the position has not changed much since 1980. It is a very deep rooted problem. There is a revised English curriculum, which will place an increased emphasis on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills. We have allocated 1,465 remedial teachers to primary schools to support pupils with learning difficulties, including reading difficulties. Revised remedial teaching guidelines have been prepared by an expert representative committee involving parents, teachers and the research centre. Particular attention has been focused on the revised guidelines for designated areas.</P>

Arising from those concerns I understand that management authorities have not proceeded with the filling of certain promotion posts.</P>
    <P>My Department has sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office in relation to these concerns and is in discussion with that office on the complex issues involved. While the Employment Equality Act is largely untested law, my objective is to ensure that, as far as practicable, there is in place a system of promotion which conforms with the spirit and letter of the Act. It is further my intention that immediate discussions will take place with the managerial bodies and teacher unions when the advice of the Attorney General's office is available, in order to reach agreement on any changes that may be required in procedures.</P>

      <P>If the Attorney General's office considers it is in a position to advise us on the issues involved, then it is expected that advice will be available by mid-May. The main problems in relation to this are very complex. Seniority and experience are obviously major elements in promotion. However, age and seniority are two of the factors that are under discussion.</P>
      <P>It was not the intention that there would be any discrimination. Quite a few part-time teachers are not getting credit for their part-time service in terms of promotion. That is one of the issues being examined by the Attorney General. We will await the advice of the Attorney General, which will be available fairly shortly. We hope to have the matter resolved on that basis.</P>

Does he believe promotion should be predominantly reliant on seniority? Does he believe, as the original question asked, that giving posts for life to principals is in conformity with creating a good career advancement process in teaching? Does he believe that graduates, often with HDips, should not be permitted to teach and get recognition at primary level? Does he believe that is equality? Does he believe that those who do not have qualifications but have 20 years teaching experience should have access to a course which would give them recognition on grounds of equality? Does he have any views on the development of a fair and adequate staffing structure that will create good promotional opportunities for teachers? I would like to hear the Minister's views, not what comments he understands the Attorney General might make on some legal loophole.</P>

      <P>The report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science on school transport in Ireland was received in my Department last November. The report deals with a broad range of transport issues and contains many recommendations for changes to the school transport system. Some of these recommendations contain major implications relating to funding.</P>
      <P>The school transport section of my Department is carrying out an ongoing assessment, including costings, of the various recommendations. Some improvements have been announced in relation to areas where assessments have been completed. These include extended eligibility for pupils where bullying is proven or the nearest school building is physically unsuitable. In addition, school buses will be required to carry communication systems and guidelines will be issued to schools where buses are hired outside of the school transport system. Further announcements will be made as assessment of other recommendations is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last February when the Minister issued the statement, he said a departmental committee is making a report on the review of catchment areas. When will that report be completed?</P>
      <P>He also stated that he would receive legal advice on the regulation of school buses, which are currently outside the school transport scheme. Has he received that legal advice, and what decision has he taken on it?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister sought legal advice on the issue of insurance for children awaiting buses? Children are not covered by the school insurance once they leave the school grounds and are covered by Bus Éireann's insurance once they get on the school bus, but in the intervening period there is no insurance cover and nobody takes responsibility. Has he looked into that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the catchment boundaries are a large complex issue but I have given instructions for a committee to be established to look at the catchment boundaries in view of the changes in demography. I have no idea how long the committee will take to report as it is a big job, but I asked it to do so as quickly as possible. I am afraid the Deputy must be satisfied with that for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> We have received legal advice on the matter of people who privately hire buses. It is, as I anticipated the last day on Question Time, that the Department has no function in the area. It goes so far as to tell us that we do not have any legal authority to board those buses or to examine them. The legal advice is that they are entirely outside our remit.</P>
    <P>To the best of my recollection, there is some legal opinion on the liability for children awaiting buses. Some time ago the Department commissioned legal opinion on that. Unfortunately, as Deputy Naughten will be aware, the law is not an exact science and my understanding is that at least one, if not more, of the teaching organisations have commissioned legal advice, which is precisely contrary to the legal advice received by the Department. That is the current state of play on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my question on that legal advice. What was the recommendation contained therein?</P>
      <P>On the other reply of the Minister of State that the schools buses are outside the system, he stated that it is outside his remit. Is it not the case that if it is outside his remit, it is within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government? What discussions has the Minister of State or his officials had with the Department of the Environment and Local Government on school bus safety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is a private arrangement between groups of parents and people who supply buses for hire. It is not necessarily within the remit of any Department. It is only within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government in that that Department obviously issues a road worthiness certificate when somebody obtains a licence.</P>
      <P>On the issue of safety, I have been advised that all I can do is disseminate widely the guidelines and safety standards which my Department imposes on its buses, that is, the buses which are owned by Bus Éireann or private contractors employed by Bus Éireann as part of the school transport scheme. There are various standards which apply in those cases, as the Deputy will be aware, and there are various advance inspections. All the documentation on insurance, road-worthiness, tax, etc., must be produced and the Department must satisfy itself about various matters. The Department has disseminated the guidelines in order that they will be available for any group of parents who wish to hire a private contractor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>What discussions has the Minister of State had with the Department of the Environment and Local Government on this report? If a public transport service using a bus needs a licence from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, how can he <Col N="807" /> tell me that one does not need a licence to transport children to school? Is that acceptable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Any vehicle which goes on the public road needs a licence. To take a vehicle on the public road without a licence is a criminal offence. As far as discussions with the Department of the Environment and Local Government are concerned, we have nothing to discuss because it is a private arrangement between a group of parents and somebody supplying a bus for hire. The same applies when a school hires a bus to take people to a football match or when parents get together to ferry children to school, whether by means of a car pool or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the health, fitness and well-being of children lies in the first instance with their parents or guardians. As their primary carers, it falls to them to ensure that children participate in physical activities as part of their recreation. As Minister for Education and Science, it is my responsibility to ensure that suitable programmes in physical education are provided and implemented in the school curricula at primary and second levels.</P>
      <P>A research study published in 1997, which was supported by my Department, showed that almost 85% of 11-12 year old children participate in physical activity four or more times a week. The same study found that the child's physical education experience was positively associated with her or his physical self-perception. These figures in relation to activity levels of children are encouraging.</P>
      <P>In primary schools, it is recommended that a minimum of one hour per week should be allocated to physical education. It is further envisaged that an appropriate proportion of the discretionary curriculum time of one hour per week for infant classes and two hours per week for first to sixth classes would be devoted to physical education, as circumstances may warrant.</P>
      <P>I will send details of a major initiative in the area of sport and physical education at primary level to schools shortly. This initiative, which will cost £2 million per annum, will help raise the awareness of sport and healthy lifestyles among primary school pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The syllabus for physical education in <i>Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools</i> recom<Col N="808" /> mends two hours per week for the physical education programme at both junior and senior cycle. Programmes in physical activity in our schools are provided for in two ways: programmes in physical education based on the syllabus; and co-curricular programmes which include sport and a wide range of other activities. The skills, understandings and attitudes developed within the formal programmes in physical education provide a foundation for co-curricular sport and related programmes.</P>

That I am introducing an initiative for primary schools, where I think it will be well directed, is an indication of how strongly I feel about the area.

      <P>I wish to raise two issues with the Minister on this matter. In congratulating him on the increase in spending on school buildings, does he believe there is still scope to work with perhaps the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation in terms of national lottery grants to co-ordinate school and community funding of and uses for buildings? Currently, there is no co-ordination and many primary and secondary schools do not have appropriate sporting facilities. Perhaps a link between both Departments would maximise available funding.</P>
      <P>In terms of the fitness and well-being of pupils, I welcome the provision of £2 million. Is enough being done on an interdepartmental basis and with the health boards in terms of under age drinking, smoking and the abuse of substances?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister agree to conduct a survey at leaving certificate level so we can have some hard <Col N="810" /> information about the extent to which leaving certificate students participate in sport? I believe participation is very low and deteriorating. This is a cause for concern and platitudes are not enough. We should get concrete information and implement concrete policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding whether I answered the question, I was asked about the number of hours by Deputy Belton. I gave the exact number of hours and the way in which they are set.</P>
      <P>Certainly I would be interested in conducting a survey as I think it would be very relevant, and I will see what can be done in that regard. Physical exercise is crucial at primary level.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keaveney raised the issues of communities and schools combining in the provision of physical buildings. There is a huge programme of physical buildings. However, the question related only to the number of hours on the programme. It would be very beneficial if the community, local sporting organisations and schools worked together to provide better facilities. Obviously, higher standard facilities can be provided if this is done, something I have been examining with those concerned.</P>

This figure is inclusive of funding for existing programmes &ndash; the early start pilot pre-school project, the Rutland Street pre-school project, the pre-school for Traveller children and pilot pre-school provision for autistic children. It includes funding for additional measures encompassed in the White Paper. The proposed allocations for these measures under the national development plan over the next three years are £1 million in 2000, £5.3 million in 2001 and £6.3 million in 2002.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, there are a number of very valuable projects, which are mainly pilot projects, though the Rutland Street project is running for a long time. However, it is not an extensive service.</P>

      <P>The reply is disappointing. Does the Minister accept that, given our economic prosperity and the disgracefully low level of provision for early childhood education, it is time to move beyond the pilot stage and develop a proper State funded pre-school service, as every other EU country has done? I am given no comfort by the Minister's reply. He seems to be talking only in terms of the State funding fairly miserable pilot projects. Has the Government any proposal for proper pre-school services for all children based on a proper financial footing?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 56 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>First, I avail of this opportunity to thank the members of both the steering group and the technical working group and all who assisted the group in preparing its report. I particularly thank Mr. Edward Blackstock who acted as chairperson to both groups. I welcome the report, which represents a comprehensive review of the funding provisions for second level schools, and I commend the group for the clarity of its approach and the quality of the analysis undertaken.</P>
      <P>At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Deputies will be aware of the historical anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
      <P>In this connection I draw the attention of Members to my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from next September. My approach in establishing this fund is to address deficiencies in the existing funding structures. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. The flexibility given to schools under this initiative will be supported by the putting in place of guidelines which will strike the right balance between allowing a reasonable level of discretion and achieving the implementation of national policy priorities. I am fully committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for second level schools and I will continue to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister publish the report so that we can cross-examine him on it rather than on his interpretation of it?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was published by the HEA, not by me, but I will make sure a copy is provided for the Deputy. The issue is complicated by the fact that different schools, whether comprehensive, voluntary or whatever, have different funding mechanisms. The question of need must be addressed. I will do so and will try to establish the comparisons in order to achieve an equitable basis. Schools have grown out of different traditions and that is why I introduced the school services support fund, which will provide money to schools. This will give them flexibility as it can be used for a variety of reasons. I appreciate the Deputy's point.</P>
      <P>The sum of £7 million is substantial at this stage but when all schools are compared there will be many differences, as Deputy Bruton pointed out. The main task is to provide additional funding to meet all the demands. Additional funding has been provided but it will be a major problem for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is unusual that a Bill should be introduced in this manner and at such short notice. However, the Government considers it necessary to do so on this occasion to address a legal doubt which has emerged in regard to the powers of local authorities to make charges for services which they are required or empowered to provide under current legislation.</P>
      <P>This short Bill does no more than confirm the commonly understood position regarding the powers available to local authorities to charge for certain services. As part of that process it is necessary to validate the position in regard to any such charges made to date. It would be useful to put the charging issue in context. As Members will be aware, local authorities charge for a wide range of services and they derive their power to do so in four main ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, certain legislation empowering or requiring a local authority to provide a particular service can include a specific power to enable authorities to charge in respect of that service. An example is fire call-outs under the Fire Services Act, 1981. Second, in some cases legislation empowering or requiring a local authority to provide a particular service may specify a mandatory charge or fee and also set out the level of such charge or fee in primary legislation or regulations. An example is planning fees. Third, in some cases where legislation confers some power or function on a local authority in regard to the provision of a service, that legislation may empower the auth<Col N="816" /> ority to make by-laws in regard to that service, including the power to charge for it. Some examples include off-street car parking charges which are covered by by-laws under section 101 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and also on-street car parking by-laws under section 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994. Finally, where none of the first three charging powers applies, and relevant legislation does not specifically address the question of charges for services provided, local authorities have relied on the provisions of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, to levy charges in respect of such services. That is the situation in relation to local authority waste charges.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996, put in place a modern, comprehensive framework for waste management. In doing so it repealed the provisions relating to waste which dated back to the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1907.</P>
    <P>At the time, it was clearly envisaged and understood that local authorities could and would continue to provide waste collection and disposal services and, accordingly, would continue to levy waste charges. As a result of the general reliance on the 1983 financial provisions legislation, however, it was not considered necessary to make provision for charging in the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>The then Government's intention was clear. Its December 1996 policy document, Better Local Government, stated explicitly that waste charges are an important instrument in waste management policy and that the option must be retained to allow local authorities to continue to provide environmentally safe refuse services while being in a position to defray the costs through charges.</P>
    <P>This Government's 1998 policy statement on waste management &ndash; Changing Our Ways &ndash; recognised as fundamental to efficient waste management that all producers of waste must pay fully for its collection, treatment and disposal. The document specifically recommended that local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for waste services they provide and, as a matter of equity and to incentivise waste reduction, the level of waste charges imposed by local authorities should vary according to usage.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have relied on the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, as a legal basis for the imposition of waste charges. Looking at that Act, section 2 provides that where any existing enactment requires or enables a local authority to provide a service, but does not empower the authority to charge for that service, the enactment is deemed to empower the authority accordingly.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;existing enactment&rdquo; used in that section is defined in section 1 of that Act to include any amendments or extensions made to the enactment concerned. On that basis, and in light of the provisions of the Interpretation Act, 1937, dealing with the construction of references to repealed statutes and revoked instruments, it has been considered that the modern provisions <Col N="817" /> and repeals introduced under the Waste Management Act, 1996, did not affect the entitlement of a local authority to rely on the 1983 Act for the making of charges in respect of waste services.</P>
    <P>A view could be advanced, however, contrary to this general understanding. This view would suggest that reliance on the 1983 Act to levy charges might be unsound if the relevant subsequent legislation empowering or requiring the provision of a service does not explicitly purport to amend or repeal pre-1983 legislation. While the specific concern at issue arose in relation to the basis for waste charges, other local authority charges made under the 1983 Act may also be affected. In these circumstances, the Government cannot allow the uncertainty in this issue to prevail and I have, therefore, brought forward this Bill to put the matter beyond doubt and to validate relevant charges made to date.</P>
    <P>The substantive sections of the Bill are sections 2 to 4. Section 2 substitutes a revised definition for the definition of &ldquo;existing enactment&rdquo; in the 1983 Act. The effect of this is to ensure that an &ldquo;existing enactment&rdquo; will mean any enactment in force on, or at any time after, the commencement of the 1983 Act until the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 validates certain charges made by local authorities. It provides that a relevant charge made by a local authority by virtue of section 2 of the 1983 Act is deemed to have been validly made and may be recovered as validly and effectively as if this Act had been in operation at the time of the making of the charge.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that this Act will not prejudice any proceedings that might have been initiated prior to the publication of the Bill in relation to the validity of the charge made by virtue of section 2 of the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill does nothing more than confirm the <i>status quo</i>. It does not in any way extend the current powers of local authorities to charge for services they provide under existing law. It does not introduce any power to charge for services which local authorities might be required or empowered to provide under any future legislation. It also does not overturn or affect any existing legislation which prohibits the imposition of charges for any local authority service. The sole intention behind the legislation is to avoid doubt so that there is legal certainty about the power of local authorities to rely on the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, to charge for services which they provide.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is undesirable that it should be necessary to consider legislation of this nature. In matters where we are making charges on the public it is important to get things right the first time, that legislation brought through this House is properly considered and that all its implications for and connections with other legislation have been considered. We can only regret that it has <Col N="818" /> been found necessary to introduce this Bill and deal with it so quickly.</P>
      <P>Hindsight makes wise men of us all. I reread the debate on the Waste Management Act, 1996, and on no Stage in either the Dáil or Seanad was I able to find any trace of concern about the statutory basis for making these charges. When the Bill was being debated there was no doubt about the validity and solidity of the basis that had been provided in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, for the charges. That Act was vociferously opposed by the current Minister's party and the implementation was vigorously objected to. There was, of course, yet another Damascene conversion and Fianna Fáil has since taken a different view. When the Waste Management Act, 1996, was passed, no question was raised about the validity or reliability of the basis for charging.</P>
      <P>I do not want to misinterpret the Minister but the feeling that there is something amiss in the basis of these charges is not a finely settled feeling. The Minister, in his speech, did not say there is a problem. He has not said there is a quantifiable doubt. What he said was there may be a problem and that there are two possible interpretations of the basis for the charges. We could say we, and the Minister, are not really sure this measure is necessary but that because there is that question, it is felt we better do this. That is a reasonable case to make.</P>
      <P>If we examine the provisions of the Waste Management Act, 1996, specifically section 6, which deals with repeals and revocations, we will see that Act did not interfere with the 1983 Act. It did not repeal or modify any of the provisions of the 1983 Act which is the basis for charges in this case. Far from being the dramatic rescue operation, which some people have classified this legislation, it is what I would call in more mundane terms, a ministerial safety pin to add to the belt and braces already in the legislation. I do not see a reason in this Bill, as far as the substance of it is concerned, for being hugely concerned or for delivering any of the single transferable rants about the Bill and local charges generally which we have heard since it was first announced.</P>
      <P>The Minister said section 4 will not prejudice any proceedings which might have been initiated prior to the passage of the Bill through the House. Is there information on what proceedings, if any, might have been taken on the basis of the doubt which seems to have arisen? Have any proceedings been taken? If so, what stage have they reached and what is the basis of such proceedings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to state that the Bill does nothing more than confirm the <i>status quo</i> and that it does not introduce any new power for local authorities to make new charges which are not currently contemplated in existing legislation. Is there anything in the Bill &ndash; the history of this entitles me to ask this question &ndash; which, if enacted, would constitute an obstacle to charge <Col N="819" /> which might be contemplated in the future? I do not say this to encourage the Minister to invent new charges but I would like to know if consideration has been given to obstacles this Bill might place in the way of anything this House might wish to do in the future by way of legislation. If there is, we should think about it very carefully and avoid doing that. It would be bizarre if, having considered the Bill, we were to run the risk of having another Bill in similar circumstances in the future designed to prevent the opposite happening. I would like to know if the Minister, the Government or the Attorney General have considered anything this Bill might prevent in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well that in working out environment policy here and under the terms of European directives, to which we have subscribed, there may be cases in the future where we will be required to have charges either on a narrow or broader basis for certain environmental policies. I would like to be sure we do not put obstacles in the way of the proper consideration of those types of policies by passing this Bill today.</P>
    <P>Can we be sure the basis for the charges, which are currently the subject of some doubt in the Minister's mind, is secure if this Bill is passed? Will the Minister assure me that this matter has been properly considered by the Government and the Attorney General, although I have to take a certain distance bearing in mind that when the Attorney General was a member of the Opposition, his most frequent criticism of measures he disliked was to immediately claim they were unconstitutional? However, he seems to have changed his mind about a good many things since then.</P>
    <P>In the statements on this matter which have emanated from Government in the past day or two, reference was made to the fact that this year there is upwards of £70 million in revenue involved in these charges for local authorities and that in the period since the doubt appeared to become operational, that is, since the coming into effect of the Waste Management Act, 1996 in the region of £100 million has been collected. Will the Minister tell me if there is any estimate or guesstimate of how much might be outstanding and still owed to local authorities either this year or since the Act came into effect? Will he indicate the status of any amount still outstanding and due to local authorities? If we pass this Bill in its current form, will those amounts unpaid and still outstanding be recoverable?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;having:</P>
      <P>&ndash;regard to the inadequate time between the tabling of the Bill and the opening of the debate;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the inadequate information provided by the Minister as to the need for the Bill;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Minister to ensure that there are adequate waiver schemes in place for persons whose means are insufficient to meet charges;</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.</P>
      <P>This is one of the strangest pieces of legislation to come before the House in a long time. The Minister acknowledged that the Bill came before the House in an unusual way. It was published yesterday and all Stages are being taken in this House today. It is intended to pass all Stages in the Seanad tomorrow and to enact it this side of Easter. Only in very extraordinary circumstances should the Oireachtas be asked to address legislation in that type of emergency way.</P>
      <P>The legislation was bounced at the House and is being rushed through. We are told it is ostensibly to address deficiencies or omissions in earlier legislation. The one principle or lesson this House has learned over the years is that rushed legislation is bad legislation. This House will not have sufficient time to consider the full implications of the Bill the Minister has put before us. I expected some explanation from the Minister on what prompted the Bill. Given that the House is being asked to deal with the Bill as an emergency, I expected him to put before it the legal opinion on which the Bill is based. I expected him to tell us what gave rise to the Bill. What prompted it? Is there a litigation? Has somebody made charges? Are there cases being taken against local authorities? If so, how many? When were they initiated? What is the basis of them?</P>
      <P>It is not clear that this Bill is necessary. I understand the terms of the Interpretation Act are such as to deal with the kind of situation the Minister has described where an old enactment is repealed in later legislation but where that older enactment is effectively repeated in some form in that legislation and is deemed to be continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unusual for legislation to occasionally come before the House when there has been some legal action, where a case has been tested in court and the courts have made a decision and it becomes apparent that legislation is needed. There has not been a court case in this instance. The courts have not said there is any deficiency in existing legislation. All we are being asked to accept here is opinion that we have not seen, <Col N="821" /> prompted by circumstances that have not been described to us. An adequate case has not been made by the Minister for the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We know what the legislation means in practice. It means the Minister is asking the House to retrospectively validate charges made by local authorities irrespective of the legal basis for those charges in the past. It is an extraordinarily wide, sweeping measure to say that, in respect of any charges made by local authorities since 1983, irrespective of any basis for a legal challenge against them, this legislation will legally wipe the slate clean. It is a measure designed to prevent any possible seeking of redress in the courts by any citizen who considers that a charge has been unfairly or improperly made. It is the wrong way to deal with legislation and it is profoundly anti-democratic.</P>
    <P>I have had some practical experience in my local authority in the making of waste charges. The local authority in Dun Laoghaire introduced charges for refuse collection earlier this year. Policy documents, including policy documents of the previous Government, stated that waste charges could be an instrument in waste management. However, it was not intended that they should be a catch-all revenue raising instrument for local authorities who cannot balance their books. The charge introduced in Dun Laoghaire, which I opposed at the time, is unfair. It is a household charge of £150 which makes no distinction between people who can afford to pay it and those who cannot. The sum of £150 may be the price of a few rounds of golf for some well-off people, but it is a week's take-home pay for somebody who is on the minimum wage. Even the reduced charge, the so-called &ldquo;waivered&rdquo; charge of £75, is a week's income for an old-age pensioner on a social welfare pension. It is an uneven charge because it makes no distinction between the household that puts out half a bag ful of waste and somebody who puts out several bins. It is an environmentally unsound charge in that it provides no incentive for reduction in waste. A charging regime based on the amount of waste produced would make some sense on environmental grounds, but a charging regime which makes no distinction based on the amount of waste produced is ultimately environmentally counterproductive. I have met quite a number of constituents who tell me that they were taking their bottles to the bottle bank, that they were taking paper for recycling, that they had a compost heap in the garden and were doing their best to reduce their output of waste, but that if the county council is now going to charge them £150 irrespective of the amount of waste they put out, they will put it all in the bin for the council to collect. A blanket household charge which makes no distinction between the amount of waste produced is counterproductive.</P>
    <P>It now appears, and I invite the Minister to tell us whether this is so, that the charges made by the Dun Laoghaire council were not in fact legal, <Col N="822" /> and that the legislation he is bringing in is to retrospectively make them legal. We should have some explicit answer on that.</P>
    <P>The whole area of waste management here is an absolute mess. The Waste Management Act, 1996, which was introduced by Deputy Howlin when he was Minister and the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, also introduced by Deputy Howlin, are not being implemented by the Government. We have chaos in the area of waste management. The amount of waste being produced by this country at the moment is increasing by 12.5% per annum. The number of sites which are available for the disposal of waste has been reduced from about 300 in the early 1990s to less than 50 currently. There are disputes and controversy in virtually every local authority area in the country about a super dump or an incinerator. There is confusion and difference between one local authority area and another in relation to charging.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, there is a supposed national strategy on waste, which is contained in a document published by the Minister in 1998 on changing our ways. Central to that strategy, we were told, was recycling. A very ambitious target of 35% for recycling was set in that strategy document. Instead of reaching that target, the amount of waste being recycled as a proportion of the total amount of waste is in decline. The recent EPA report shows that it had dropped to less than 4% in 1998. The Kerbside recycling facility in Dublin has collapsed, and there are no signs that there are any strategies or facilities in place to enable this country to meet its recycling targets.</P>
    <P>Despite all this, the emergency legislation being introduced does not relate to the crisis of waste and litter. It does not relate to any other area of the Minister's portfolio. That homeless men in this city are being put out on the street due to the closure of hostels for the homeless, or because these are not being made available to the Eastern Health Board as they previously were, is apparently not an emergency. The only thing that has become an emergency is the possibility that certain local authorities might have made charges which are not valid and that they might not now be able to collect the money. The plight of the homeless is not an emergency. The collapse of Kerbside was not an emergency. The state of our streets with litter and waste is not an emergency. The fact that the landfill dumps in the greater Dublin area are exhausted, that there is nowhere else to put waste in Dublin and that we are on the brink of a very serious waste crises in the greater Dublin area is not an emergency. What is an emergency? It is that some councils might not be able to collect money from the public. That is what the Minister regards as an emergency.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going about dealing with the problem of waste in the wrong way. The waste problem needs to be tackled not at the householder's end, which is where it is being tackled at the moment, but at the producer's end. We know, for example, that 50% of waste going into landfill sites is from the construction industry. There is <Col N="823" /> an unanswerable case for the reuse and recycling of construction materials. Where are the proposals on that? It is purely on an experimental and voluntary basis with the building industry. The Minister has not put any serious measures in place to date on the reuse and recycling of construction material or on the recovery of waste. No regulations have been made requiring car manufacturers or suppliers to take responsibility for the disposal of used cars nor have the manufacturers and suppliers of electrical goods been made responsible for the disposal of those goods. The whole focus in the Minister's and the Government's strategy on waste is to put it at the end of the cycle, on the householder putting out the bin. It is a wrong strategy and will not deal effectively with the problem of waste. In this Bill the Minister is introducing a measure that is unfair, unwarranted, rushed, does not make good legislation and will not have the support of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The first I heard of the Bill was today. I profoundly object to legislation being railroaded through the House in this manner without any adequate case being set out as to the purpose of the legislation and why there is an emergency. The Minister describes the purpose as unusual. That puts it mildly. He said the justification for it is &ldquo;to address a legal doubt that has emerged&rdquo;. The least he owes the House is to spell out the origins of the legal doubt. How did it emerge? &ldquo;Emerge&rdquo; is a beautiful word but as used here it only serves to obfuscate the purpose of this legislation. Why did it emerge? Does it arise from a particular case? Will we learn a great deal more about this Bill after the Government puts it through the Oireachtas and it is enacted? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had emergency legislation rushed through the House like this before. One will recall the danger of the liquidation of the PMPA and one could understand why the Minister for Industry and Commerce would come into the House and take prudent steps to try to protect the consumer in such a situation. However, I do not see any analogy in this case and it has been rare, in the history of the House, for legislation to be railroaded through all Stages just before we rise for the Easter recess. If a doubt has emerged, when did it do so? Could we not have taken this legislation at an early stage in this term when we could have reflected on its provisions and have had an opportunity to scrutinise it in the normal way? What is so pressing that it could not await the Easter recess and be initiated immediately on our return so that it could be subjected to proper scrutiny? The Minister has not explained any of this. As a result, his pointing to a defect that no <Col N="824" /> one on either side of the House identified during the passage of the Waste Management Bill, 1996, seems to be the best argument for not rushing this Bill through. If there was a defect in a Bill that was prepared and processed in the normal way in 1996, surely that is a very good argument for not rushing this Bill through in this fashion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore dealt in some detail with the record of this Minister as if he were searching for emergency issues relating to his portfolio to put through the House. He is responsible for some of the biggest issues that confront society at present. As regards housing, all he has done is drive up the cost of private rents. The city, where there is such affluence, is a disgrace in terms of the problem of homelessness. On the waste disposal problem, I received figures from my local authority last week to show that, for the first three months of this year, 550 abandoned cars have been fished out of streams in my constituency, yet the Minister refuses to acknowledge there is a problem with abandoned cars. He refuses to make the motor industry play a part in the disposal of them and make its contribution. There are a range of other issues on which this Minister is squatting.</P>
    <P>We are told the package of local government reform has now been approved, after three years, but within the space of 24 hours he expects the House to acquiesce in the publication of a Bill which is to be processed through all Stages on the eve of the Easter recess without telling us what has produced this emergency. My constituency does not have local service charges because it refused to pay the existing ones. It is easy for people to snigger at why that happened. It was because people were subjected to punitive taxes and were expected to pay this as a double tax and they simply refused to do so. It was very interesting a few years ago to see the campaign whipped up in the House for the repeal of residential property tax. It was all very well when it began to bite the middle class. It was an inequitable tax and it was right that the Rainbow Government terminated it. If it was right for them, it was equally right for people who object to paying double taxation, as people in my constituency did on the question of water charges which I opposed then and have opposed consistently. As a member of the Rainbow Government I had some small hand in ensuring they were terminated.</P>
    <P>The Minister must tell the House the basis of the emergency that has emerged and has caused him to bring forward this legislation, process it in this undemocratic fashion and not give us any reasonable opportunity to scrutinise its provisions, otherwise he is leaving himself open to the charge that something is being concealed from the House that we will learn about when the legislation has been enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute. I thank Deputies Gilmore and Rabbitte for sharing time. There was an old saying <Col N="825" /> that at Eastertime you got your Easter clúdach. We used to go around collecting eggs. This is certainly an Easter clúdach. In Drogheda Corporation and Louth County Council, of which I was a member for 25 years, both my wife, Alderman Betty Bell, and I consistently opposed service charges of any kind for the reasons enunciated by my colleagues. I was very proud of the fact that, prior to the 1999 estimates, Drogheda Corporation was the only council outside of Dublin that did not have any service charges, water, sewerage or bin charges.  After a long and bitter debate I was very disappointed that charges of £110 were approved for the first time in the history of my home town, the largest borough in Ireland. I was equally disappointed when the corporation members voted 9 to 3 in favour of those charges and did not listen to what I had said consistently &ndash; that the imposition of bin service charges was not legally constituted, would not succeed, would be challenged and fail. I wish to put on the record, because it will emerge in my home town, that while Drogheda Corporation voted in favour of bin charges by nine to three, three Labour councillors voted against the charges. That decision was illegal. It was prompted and pushed by the manager on the advice of the Department. This means that from the initiation of these charges in Drogheda anybody who was notified for the payment of charges was notified illegally. The least that could have happened was that this would be recognised by the Department and if an illegal decision was taken the Department should pay the bill. A bad mistake was made against the advice of people such as myself and we were not listened to. An illegal decision was put through in Drogheda Corporation and in other local authorities throughout the length and breadth of the land. Therefore, the Department and the Government should pick up the tab. Like my colleagues I resent the fact that this is being bulldozed through. At least we could have tried to find some agreed method of getting around this issue but this is not the way to do it. To bulldoze retrospective legislation that is not necessary at this stage because it has not as yet been challenged in the court &ndash; even though I suggest it will be challenged &ndash; is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of waste management is a national catastrophe because no two local authorities apply the same rate of charges or the same system of waste management. Only a couple of weeks ago I asked the Minister the number of councils that had applied a waste management plan. Only a handful, three in Dublin, three elsewhere and one in Cork, had submitted a waste management plan to his Department after three years. The largest dump in Ireland, in Drogheda, was closed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The other two dumps, one in mid-Louth and one in Dundalk, also under investigation, will be closed. Where will the refuse be put? This is an absolute shambles. We push through emergency legislation simply to make the people pay for a service they will not have. They will not <Col N="826" /> have a dump into which to put refuse. It is being opposed in Dublin and all over the country. Yet we are bulldozing through legislation to make people pay for a service that is diminishing on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>This matter is the responsibility of Government. It is immoral for the Government to put through a plan to deal with waste disposal in this form. The money is available. Rather than bulldoze through this type of legislation on a retrospective basis, for a service which the people do not have, the Government should bring forward a proper national plan to deal with this important subject.</P>
    <P>It was a Labour Minister who was responsible for the elimination of water charges in conjunction with our colleagues in Government. We were told in Louth County Council, in Drogheda Corporation and by every local authority that it could not be done. Yet, Deputy Howlin found a way to do it and it has been successful. The Minister, who is Deputy Howlin's successor, must find a way to eliminate the system of charges for bin collection. He can then get on to the same platform and be respected in the same way as my colleague Deputy Howlin is respected both locally and nationally.</P>

      <P>The Government Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, never tires of telling Deputies that Dáil Éireann is not a legislation factory. Therefore, it is revealing how the Government can increase legislative production when the mood takes it. Legislation can be rushed through the House when it is deemed necessary. Today's Bill is a good example of that.</P>
      <P>The Minister will, no doubt, argue that waste charges are a key element of the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle. They should be part of the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle but the reality is that the Minister and the local authorities have turned this principle on its head. The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle has now become the &ldquo;pay the polluter&rdquo; principle. Ordinary people will be asked to fork out their hard earned money to fund incineration projects throughout the country. This is precisely the way the primary polluters, industry, would like it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has come before the House because of deficiencies in the Waste Management Act, 1996. That Act also provided for the setting up of Repak to look after the recycling responsibilities of industry. Recently on a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme the Minister was forced to admit to me that Repak has not been a success. There have not been any prosecutions to date of those companies that have not joined Repak. Repak has not lived up to its environmental responsibilities and yet the Minister sits back and allows a waste <Col N="827" /> problem to become a waste crisis. The Minister says he is not to blame, neither is industry but rather ordinary people who have got the wrong attitude apparently. Who will pay for this mess? Again, it will be ordinary people.</P>
    <P>How much money has Repak raised by recycling? If we compare that amount with the amount raised from waste charges on households there is a glaring disparity. Why has the Minister not rushed through regulations or legislation to deal with any anomalies concerning, for example, Repak. EPA figures show we have a waste crisis. Waste has doubled in recent years. Why the excessive delay in a small measure such as introducing a tax on plastic bags? We have been waiting a long time for it.</P>
    <P>While we have a waste crisis the Minister has sat back and has not introduced emergency legislation. We have a housing crisis and as other Deputies have said the Minister sat back and allowed rents to escalate and people to go homeless and yet there was no emergency legislation. We now have a drinking water crisis. We were informed this morning that local authorities said that in three to five years there will be severe water shortages in Dublin. There are already problems concerning water pressure all over the city and yet emergency legislation is not required. There is a severe litter problem but the Minister sits back and allows it to continue. There is also a river and water pollution problem and yet there is no legislation to tax nitrates or phosphates. This is a Minister and a ministry that is marked by complacency because he has his priorities skewed. This Government has all but ignored the environmental issues. The reason he does so is that these concerns conflict with the needs and interests of the financial backers of the major parties.</P>
    <P>Today's revelations in Dublin Castle have convinced ordinary people, as if they needed convincing, that the establishment is deeply corrupt. Will the Government rush through legislation to deal with corruption? I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday I was approached by a woman in the Dublin Food Co-op who told me she had no objection in principle to paying waste charges but she objected strongly to those charges being used to fund an incinerator in Ringsend. She represents the very reasonable view of many people. A &ldquo;waste not, pay not&rdquo; scheme linked to proper &ldquo;reduce, re-use, and recycle&rdquo; policies makes perfect sense. We know that the bulk of the money raised by way of these charges will not go towards recycling but will go towards capital intensive incineration projects. Many of my constituents feel let down by the Kerbside scheme which dumped up to 40% of recyclable materials in landfill sites. When the Green Party recommended some years ago that Kerbside be monitored by a committee the idea was rejected. Now we know why. Kerbside cost about £2 million per annum. This is a pittance in terms of waste man<Col N="828" /> agement and minuscule compared with the monstrous and unjustifiable costs of incineration.</P>
    <P>I would not have considered tabling an amendment to this Bill if the establishment parties had accepted an amendment to the Waste Management Bill, 1996, in the name of my colleague Deputy Sargent. Deputy Sargent sought to exclude incineration as a waste management option but his farsighted approach was rejected out of hand. Under the Act, incineration is defined as energy recovery. This means that by incinerating waste the local authorities are meeting their objectives under the EU Packaging Directive which stipulates that we must recycle and recover 25% of our waste. The Commission makes clear that we must first try to recycle as much of our waste as possible.</P>
    <P>I will outline the worst case scenario of what might happen. Local authorities will sign contracts with private incinerator companies and the local authority will be obliged to supply the private contractor with waste. Incinerators usually have a life of up to 30 years. One can see that there will be a conflict between recycling and incineration. If the private company wants to make a profit it requires waste with a high calorific value, such as paper and plastics. Likewise, the local authorities can claim that there is not a market for recyclable materials and that incineration recovers energy. Inevitably, recycling will decline and incineration increase and all the time those conscientious people who are paying charges for what they believe is recycling will see that money going up in smoke.</P>
    <P>The Minister often speaks about sustainability but incineration is not sustainable. For many years municipal incinerators have not been built in Australia, Canada or the United States. The arguments for incinerators are bogus. That is why we will put down an amendment to this Bill. For every three tons put into an incinerator, one ton of ash is left. What will we do with that ton of ash? An incineration policy will mean continued landfill with highly toxic residue and very little recycling. That is why these charges are a con job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé i gcoinne an Bhille seo. The Green Party objects strongly to the panic with which this Bill is being rushed through the Dáil. The Bill attempts to cover past mistakes but hiding mistakes will prove as difficult as hiding landfill sites. It seeks to endorse the appalling list of disastrous charge regimes throughout the country and will remind people once again of just how flawed the policies of the Government and of various local authorities have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These many flaws are found in relation to charges and to waste management in general. The first flaw is glaringly obvious to anyone who sees taxation as a way of affecting behaviour and not merely of raising revenue. It is the flat charge nature of water and refuse collection charges which penalise and discourage environmentally careful and conscientious behaviour. They reward the most wasteful behaviour while penalising the <Col N="829" /> most disadvantaged. They are everything that taxation ought not to be. Furthermore, they are uncollectable because of the understandable resistance to them.</P>
    <P>Repak is another example of this Government's attempt to side-step its responsibilities in relation to waste. By being licensed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Repak is supposedly doing the work of the Minister. However, it has failed to reduce waste and its only success has been in allowing waste producers to avoid their responsibilities &ndash; a shameful boast.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have also been allowed to abdicate their responsibilities. One of 200 or more amendments I tabled to the 1996 Bill would have ensured that each local authority made a waste plan before it co-operated in a regional waste plan. The Rainbow Government judged that it would be sufficient for each local authority to buy into a regional plan without having a waste plan of its own. This has resulted in local authorities paying homage to an engineering blueprint for a regional waste plan which centres on engineering rather than environmental solutions, hence the reliance on large landfill sites and incineration.</P>
    <P>The failure by the Minister to act on minimisation of waste, the supreme option in the hierarchy of waste management, is shameful. The Minister has spoken of European legislation preventing the retention of glass milk bottles, for example, or the use of other re-usable packaging. He has shown none of the courage of EU countries such as Denmark which have challenged that provision in European legislation and refuse to lie down in the face of European bureaucracy, which is anti-environmental in this case. The lack of enforcement of anti-litter legislation is another example of a failing the Minister must correct before he imposes charges on people who can ill afford them.</P>
    <P>The biggest flaw in our waste management policy is that we are not using the best available waste management technology. Why should we pay for flawed technology. When the Minister talks of using state of the art technology many people who deal with waste and who have examined this question in depth answer that he is using state of the ark technology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so clever. My goodness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is old technology. If the Minister is serious about providing solutions, why is he using technology which other countries tried more than 20 years ago and would abandon now if they could? Large landfills and incineration, both of which involve the need to get rid of large quantities of ash, are cousins of each other. The Minister must realise that the people doing the work on these systems are engineers. They are not environmentalists and they do not have environmental ways of thinking. They seek economies of scale and take engineering approaches. <Col N="830" /> For that reason they will, obviously, say that incineration and large engineered landfills are the best way to deal with waste. If the Minister was to look further afield he would discover there are many companies which would be willing to look at zero waste options. There is a multitude of options. They include placing responsibility on householders and local communities to audit and reduce waste. This has been done successfully in the Tidy Towns competition. That is the key to the solution. An out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach penalises small rural communities which are least responsible for the waste crisis.</P>
      <P>In endorsing this policy which provides for large regional waste plans the Minister is flirting with voracious worldwide companies seeking to peddle their technology here which is not acceptable in more advanced societies. They are very keen to ensure it will be a case of business as usual and that provision is made in large regional waste plans for incinerators and large infill sites so they can corner the profitable waste market.</P>
      <P>We have an opportunity to get the matter right. We have not gone down the road followed by other countries which are now stuck with 25 or 30 year plans. If they knew then what we know now about what is possible with the best available technology they would not have gone down that road. The Minister should stand back from this measure and go back to the drawing board with the help of environmentalists and not rely totally on engineers to ensure we find a solution that will be a credit rather than a liability to future generations.</P>

      <P>It is not a good idea to rush legislation. About 12 years ago just before Christmas the famous rod licence Bill was rushed through the House. This was something we came to regret and it was finally repealed within a period of four or five years. The Minister is not doing himself justice in not spelling out more clearly the reasons this Bill is necessary. In doing so he may bring more Members with him. The absence of Government backbench Members is noted.</P>
      <P>Since Deputy Dukes spoke an anti-everything line has been taken. I refute some of what has been said. Service charges are not being introduced to build incinerators. Service charges would not cover the cost of recycling facilities and landfill sites. Some valid points have been made however. Householders should be rewarded for reducing, recycling and re-using some of their waste. Apart from a waiver scheme which applies to those who put out a bin every second week, for example old age pensioners, there is no incentive for them to do so at present, except to satisfy their conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1998 the Government directed local authorities to produce waste management plans. Galway County Council, of which I am a member, was lumped together with the remaining counties in Connacht. As they did not possess the required expertise they hired consultants to produce a waste management plan which follow<Col N="831" /> ing its publication was discussed at public meetings. There was misinformation at meetings organised by those opposed to the proposals contained in the plan. People got it into their minds that the objective was to poison their lambs, children, grandchildren and everybody else. I do not have any lambs but I do have children and one grandchild whom I do not want to poison.</P>
    <P>What many people fail to understand is that when a waste management plan is produced by a local authority or a group of local authorities submissions must be invited. In the case of the local authorities in Connacht the closing date for the receipt of submissions has twice been extended. Submissions may now be submitted up to 31 May. Whenever a waste management plan is published and on public display members of the local authority concerned are obliged to keep an open mind until all submissions are received and considered. They are also obliged to educate themselves on all aspects of the plan and to seek all professional advice before finally making up their minds. They have to satisfy themselves that what is being proposed is safe and that there is no hidden agenda, as was hinted at several public meetings and in the House today. That is my interpretation of the responsibilities of public representatives.</P>
    <P>At public meetings attended by 200 to 300 members of the public all opposed to all forms of waste management except recycling, new or inexperienced councillors may state they are opposed to the proposals contained in a waste management plan. This will lead members of the public to ask, &ldquo;How come councillor X is able to say he or she is opposed to the plan and you are not?&rdquo;  Having been a member of a local authority for 25 years I think I know what my duties are. I am obliged to keep an open mind until I educate myself fully on all aspects of a plan and until the public process is complete. I will not be slow in casting my vote once I have decided what is the proper thing to do for the area I represent.</P>
    <P>Although everyone at public meetings says he or she is in favour of waste recycling, re-use and reduction, little or nothing has been done to encourage this since August 1998. A shopkeeper in Oranmore has purchased a baler to make it easier to transport cardboard to the cardboard recycling plant in Galway. That plant will sometimes take cardboard without imposing a charge. However, it cannot take it at other times because there is no trade for recycled cardboard.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give tax incentives to people who set up cardboard, paper and plastic recycling plants. We have given tax incentives for building houses and student accommodation, so why can the Minister not introduce a tax incentive scheme for the proper separation and re-use of waste? I understand from my research that it costs 2p to produce a plastic bottle but 15p to recycle it. No one will set up a business to recycle plastic bottles unless the Minister and his Department are serious about giving people grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> The Minister for Finance proposes to introduce a tax of between 3p and 10p on plastic bags in the next Finance Bill. I hope he chooses the top rate. Up to a few months ago my household used 18 plastic bags a week. If the Minister put a tax of 10p on each plastic bag, it would cost us £80 a year. That would be a step forward.</P>
    <P>I recently produced a re-usable cloth bag, which costs £2, with my logo, &ldquo;Padraic McCormack TD Supports the Environment&rdquo;, and I give them to people who come to my office. I have invested £1,200 in this project because I want to change people's mindset about using re-usable bags. The first day I went shopping with my daughter to a supermarket in Galway I almost had to assault the assistant to stop her putting our groceries into plastic bags. I told her I had my own bags and she did not believe me.</P>
    <P>I have since visited all the supermarkets in Galway and asked them to use linen bags made by Firefly in Galway, which is an association for mentally handicapped adults. I would be pleased if the supermarkets put my logo on them but I presume they will put their own logo on them, which might be more realistic. As long as they do not put the Minister's logo on them I will be happy. They can sell them for £2 at the checkout if they wish but they should be made available. I am not asking them to give them to people free of charge &ndash; I am making that sacrifice.</P>
    <P>I did not come up with this idea. I must give credit to Galway Corporation which produced a reusable bag approximately six months ago and asked shops to take them. The Minister was presented with one when he was in Galway, although he thought he was getting one of mine, which is a better bag.</P>
    <P>I was at a public meeting recently where 200 people spent three and a half hours talking about recyling. I asked them if they were aware of the bag produced by Galway Corporation or if they used it. However, no one answered me. I showed them my bag and told them to call to my office if they wanted one. I have already given out more than 250 bags. When my secretary gave a woman from Connemara my bag as she was leaving my office she said everyone in the shop would know she had visited my office. I told her if she was not happy with it she could turn it inside out. I give that as an example not to brag about myself but to show how much we must do to change people's mindset about recycling.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to promote, encourage and subsidise recycling and other waste reduction measures. Now is the time to do it. Many public meetings have been held in different areas and they have helped to make people realise that we cannot continue to produce large quantities of waste without doing something about it. The amount of waste produced in the past four years has doubled. This is due to people's growing affluence in the Celtic tiger economy and the fact they are buying more products which are wrapped in several layers of plastic. We must also deal with commercial waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> I am not against the principle of charging for the disposal of waste. However, we must compensate or reward those who reduce their waste. Unless local authorities or the Minister do that, people will stop trying to reduce the amount of waste. Bottles are the only material recycled in Galway at present. There is a good bottle recycling unit in the area. Galway Corporation is the first local authority to use a specially adapted toxic waste lorry. It comes to Galway city once a month to recycle toxic waste, such as paint, paint strippers, batteries and fluorescent tubes. We have circulated to every house in Galway a list of approximately 25 toxic materials which are recycled. I was in Galway the first day the toxic waste lorry came but nobody turned up to recycle their toxic materials.</P>
    <P>People must start to segregate and recycle their waste. Local authorities will have to include a charge for the disposal of refuse when they adopt their estimates. We will not get away with what we did five, ten or 15 years ago when dumps were covered over after three or fours years with a few loads of gravel or clay. It will cost more to keep landfills at a high standard compared to what it cost in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not sit back and say the Government has done its duty by asking local authorities to produce waste management plans and having a public debate on the issue and that it is up to councillors in local authorities to adopt the plan. The Minister should outline today or after Easter what he and his Department are doing about helping and encouraging people to recycle. We are only scratching the surface. We are fooling ourselves if no distinction is made in the cost charged to the house which puts out two or three bags every week and the house which puts out a bag every second week or a half bag every week. We cannot expect people to continue to put their bottles in the bottle bank and their paper or cardboard somewhere else every week if there is no difference in the charges. If people in Galway are going to be charged £120 per year, they will simply put the whole thing in the bin. What has the Minister done to examine the potential of recycling cardboard which is only ticking over at present? What is he doing to help shopkeepers to produce cardboard as this man is doing at his own expense in Oranmore? He has a baler which cost £5,600 and he is bailing his cardboard which makes it easier to transport.</P>
    <P>I have researched this issue. As a result of my initiative in Galway a woman asked on local radio why I was giving out re-usable bags because she would have no plastic bags with which to line her bins. This woman need not worry as there will be plenty of plastic bags left in Galway. Degradable plastic bags are being imported from the Far East and distributed by a firm in Dublin. These bags can be used to line bins and they degrade. They sell for £35 per 1,000 and £80 per 1,000 for large bin liners.</P>
    <P>I hope next year's Finance Bill will introduce a maximum tax of 10p on plastic bags. I also hope, <Col N="834" /> however, that degradable bags will be exempt from this tax so there will be an incentive to use them. The Minister should ask his officials to investigate the possibility of setting up a facility to manufacture degradable plastic bags in Ireland. Why should we import such bags from the Far East? Why is somebody not given a tax free or tax deductible incentive to set up a manufacturing facility here? The Minister should play his part in conjunction with local authorities in helping to change the mindset from disposing of waste to recycling and re-using it.</P>

      <P>However, the Minister should not take inspiration from this approach as I would hate to see the country flooded with &ldquo;Dempsey bags&rdquo;. We are in enough difficulty without having such an additional problem.</P>
      <P>This is extraordinary legislation being presented with extraordinary speed. From time to time Opposition Deputies have raised serious issues relating to legislation which require an urgent response from Government. However, we have not received the necessary response. An example of this problem in my area of responsibility is the denial of basic human rights to psychiatric patients because of a lack of legislation. The Government's lethargy in producing the Mental Health Bill speaks for itself in terms of how it perceives this issue.</P>
      <P>There has been no urgency regarding homelessness, even though it is a serious problem, particularly in urban areas. We have not seen any legislation nor any intention to introduce legislation to deal with erring members of the Judiciary even though this matter is of grave concern and needs to be dealt with. This morning, the Taoiseach responded very inadequately to Deputy Quinn's demand for action regarding the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill regulating the activities of lobbyists. This response showed a lack of urgency and focus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been rushed into the House to deal with something which may happen. It deals with a doubt, a possibility, a will-o'-the-wisp which might happen but has not happened yet. There is no court case or constitutional challenge or any clear explanation from the Minister as to why this Bill is being introduced. The only good thing one can say about it is that it gives us the opportunity to raise issues concerning waste management and disposal and I am glad other Deputies have raised very pertinent issues which <Col N="835" /> require urgent attention. Sadly those issues are not receiving such attention.</P>
    <P>In recent times in Wicklow there has been a very serious upheaval and dismantling of an essential service which people have availed of and understood as part of the work of a local authority. This service delivered protections in terms of public health which is now at risk because of management failure to deal with a serious crisis in the county. The problem is also due to political cowardice, primarily on the part of Fianna Fáil, in running away from challenges posed by recent estimates.</P>
    <P>As a result, Wicklow County Council and Bray Urban District Council rammed through a measure to privatise the service. This decision was opposed by the Labour Party. It is wrong to even call this measure privatisation. It did not constitute privatisation. What happened was that a majority of local councillors abdicated their responsibility because management provided them with the opportunity of doing so. This move delivered a service which was well established in the county to a group of predatory privateers who now operate across the county. The decision has been a cause of great public distress and anger. I am proud and glad that, in Bray at least, we managed to overturn this decision and succeeded in bringing back a local authority service. However, this did not happen in beneficial circumstances and the system has been harmed as a consequence of this disgraceful abdication of responsibility by members of the council and by management.</P>
    <P>Serious questions were raised in both local authorities as to whether they were in compliance with the Waste Management Act in terms of the comprehensiveness of the privatised service and the adequate disposal of waste. Incredibly, the Department did not even have a licensing system in place to ensure people setting up or operating such businesses were properly licensed.</P>
    <P>These issues are now the subject of a legal challenge. Did the Department of the Environment and Local Government investigate? Did the Minister establish whether there was a matter of concern? Did he examine whether there was a doubt about this decision by a local authority? I am not aware of any such response regarding the serious issues raised, yet this Bill is being introduced on the basis of a doubt. It seems a double standard is in operation. This matter concerns a real life decision made by a local authority responsible to the Department about which serious questions have been raised and not investigated by the Department.</P>
    <P>County Wicklow is probably no different from many other counties in that it has a serious waste management crisis. We do not have sufficient capacity in our landfill sites or provision for incineration. The future is very uncertain in terms of landfill. The arrangements that are being made are very short-term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> Our waste management plan, which was passed by the county council this week, relates more to wonderland than the reality with which we must all live. It contains high recycling ambitions which are very worthy and which we all support. However, while the public says it is interested in recycling, I am not sure if it is willing to participate fully. However, we must give people the benefit of the doubt. We must provide the option of recycling to every householder because of the urgent need to fully exploit that option.</P>
    <P>There was a recycling system in Bray where householders put out green boxes which were collected by the local authority. That service is no longer available. There is now a battle over who owns the green boxes &ndash; it is a privateer or the local authority? That kind of breakdown in the system sends out a very clear signal that we must take this seriously.</P>
    <P>The management record of private landfill sites has been outrageous. Local residents complain constantly about noise, nuisance, the dumping of materials that should not be in a private landfill site, vermin, disregard for planning permission and work being carried out beyond the time limit in a planning permission. For example, books could be written about how poorly the local authority has dealt with the complaints of local residents about Killegar in Enniskerry. The residents are carrying out their own monitoring because the local authority has been unable to do so.</P>
    <P>To be fair to Wicklow County Council, it is curtailed by lack of numbers and resources. We have a waste management plan which sets out very ambitious targets. It looks very good and up to the minute but does not deal with the central issues of staffing and resources in the local authority. People are becoming very cynical about the number of glossy reports, which often include a letter from the Minister and his photograph at the front, being produced. The means of implementation are never outlined. It is not clear what happens once the report comes into the public arena or how the timeframe, if there is one, will be delivered on.</P>
    <P>I was contacted today by a resident of Blackditch in Newcastle, County Wicklow. Truck after truck is driving past this householder's residence, delivering builder's rubble to a field which does not have planning permission for dumping. The well known builder who is delivering this rubble and the owner of the land, who is also well known, have no right to do this. It is clear to me that illegal dumping has increased significantly in the county as a result of what has happened. However, the measures and protections are not adequate to meet the need.</P>
    <P>Private abuse, in terms of littering and dirtying our landscape, particularly the rural landscape, is matched and reinforced by public neglect. I understand the Minister is talking about giving an amnesty for buildings and works carried out without planning permission. If that is true, I would be strongly opposed to it because it is part and parcel of allowing things to be done that are <Col N="837" /> illegal. We seem to be facilitating rather than preventing illegality.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the Labour Party deals with a very important issue, which is the lack of a waiver system provision. Elderly and poor people are hit very badly by the waste crisis. We all recognise that the cost of waste disposal is increasing. We cannot argue against that point. However, we have a social responsibility to ensure the very poor and elderly are not hurt by the fact the State has this responsibility. A proper waiver system underpinned by legislation is vital. Surely the Minister will recognise that is only fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party, as our spokesperson, Deputy Gilmore, outlined, opposes this Bill. We do so partly on the basis of the proposal to push the Bill through the House this evening. That has given very little, if any, time for the consultation process that is required when a Bill is introduced. The Bill falls down on that issue.</P>
      <P>The issue of service charges has been highly contentious over the years. The reorganisation of the greater Dublin area Bill in 1993 split the old Dublin County Council into three new local authorities &ndash; Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. That caused a major financial problem in that a Bill was introduced and the Minister said that no additional expense was to be incurred by the Exchequer. That resulted in a situation where, for example, Fingal County Council, through its elected members, was obliged to bring in water charges. As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, water charges are an unjust method of financing local authorities.</P>
      <P>The problem over the years, dating back to the infamous budget of 1978, is that the amount of money allocated to the local authorities has decreased substantially on an ongoing basis. Labour Party Deputies and members of local authorities gave a specific commitment that we wanted the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, to introduce legislation to abolish water charges. That is now the situation and we take credit for it. The great fear is that the current Minister will bring in water charges by the back door.</P>
      <P>While the Minister and the Government have engaged in a great PR exercise on waste management and litter, in reality they have done a minimal amount with the powers under that legislation. I recognise that local authorities are responsible for implementing policies, but at the same time all we hear is the principle that the polluter pays. That principle does not take into consideration the multinational companies, which are responsible for much of the pollution and waste. Let the Minister or the EU deal with that issue before they start putting their greedy fingers on the PAYE workers, the old age pensioners and the various groups again. The Labour Party is opposed to the Government's approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the waivers. To the best of my knowledge, many of the local auth<Col N="838" /> orities, which are controlled in many cases by a combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael representatives, have been in favour of privatisation of the services. Where they decide themselves that is the method and type of services they want to introduce, it is incumbent on the Government and those local authorities to ensure a mechanism is employed to allow a waiver system for senior citizens.</P>
    <P>I could speak at length on this issue. The Bill is being rushed through and there are other motives for this. The Labour Party is opposed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the request of the Chair, I will facilitate all who wish to contribute to the debate.</P>
      <P>The rushing of the Bill through the Dáil without proper prior notice and without proper debate is a deplorable manoeuvre on the part of the Government. It is an attempt by sleight of hand to enable local authorities to continue to apply and to retrospectively apply refuse and other charges to householders.</P>
      <P>The Government knows this issue is political dynamite and therefore it has brought this legislation forward in this shoddy manner in the final hours before the Easter recess in the hope that it will be enacted with minimum fuss. Clearly that will not be the case. Already today we have seen the public expression of anger at the Bill and, with little notice, a significant protest at the gates of this House.</P>
      <P>Refuse charges and other such charges affect hundreds of thousands of people and are set to affect many more as further local authorities prepare to impose charges, yet the Bill, which will affect so many people, is being guillotined in this House and sprung on an unsuspecting public.</P>
      <P>Section 2 refers to the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983. This of course brings us back to the sordid history of water charges. In the face of widespread opposition to those unjust charges, Fianna Fáil solemnly promised the electorate before the 1985 local government elections that it would not impose them. That promise was broken in local authorities throughout the State as the charges were voted in by Fianna Fáil councillors. In many cases, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael combined to secure their passage through local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people resisted water charges and were hauled before the courts. Hefty fines and even jail sentences were imposed. Those who resisted the charges were subsequently vindicated as the water charges were abolished. Contrast the treatment meted out to service charge resistors with the treatment of those who we now know have been up to their necks in corruption during the period in question, the 1980s. It is ironic that the Bill is rushed through the House on a day of shocking revelations on how local government was abused and corrupted by certain public representatives. Nobody who indulged in bribery in <Col N="839" /> the planning process or who held an Ansbacher account has gone to jail, but we have seen people jailed for protesting against the payment of unjust service charges.</P>
    <P>The context of the Bill is that the Government has failed to devise and implement a comprehensive waste management strategy. It has dumped responsibility for waste management on to local authorities without providing the necessary resources. The costs are being borne by householders who must meet refuse charges and in many cases the spiralling demands of private sector service providers.</P>
    <P>The reality is that there is no proper waste management in Ireland. Governments in both states have a range of stop-gap measures which cannot cope with the ever growing mountains of waste engulfing the country. The rate of waste reuse and recycling is the lowest in Europe. Only 7.8% of waste is recycled. The State has the highest dependence on landfills. Some 92.2% of commercial and household waste in the 26 counties goes to landfill.</P>
    <P>The onus to solve the problem has been shifted by successive Governments from themselves to the local authorities and the householders through privatisation of refuse collection and the imposition of refuse charges. Sinn Féin agrees with the principle of the polluter pays, but my party's understanding of who is the real polluter and the understanding of others, the Government included, points up two very different approaches to this principle and the issue at its core. The biggest polluters are the manufacturers of products in our consumer society. Over packaging, of which there are many examples, and over marketing must be tackled by the Government, both within this economy and at EU level.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, waste management is geared towards, and even dependent upon, incineration. There are legitimate community concerns at the environmental effects of such incinerators. Will they too be foisted upon communities as the Bill is being dumped upon us all here? There is huge public goodwill for recycling, environmental enhancement, combating litter, etc., but this has not yet been harnessed by Government.</P>
    <P>These local authority refuse charges are both unnecessary and unjust. People currently dependent on the private operators are equally deserving of a State-backed refuse collection and recycling service. That is by far the eminently preferable approach. The responsibility rests on central government to provide funds to actively address the pressing issue of the lack of local government funding in the area of tackling waste management.</P>
    <P>Given that I represent a Border constituency and spent a lifetime living within four miles of the Border, I take this opportunity to urge consideration of the cross-Border dimensions and the potential which exists to employ an all-Ireland approach to waste management. I think there is <Col N="840" /> merit in considering establishing a national waste management board as a further vehicle of cross-Border co-operation. Without going into specific instances of the reality on the ground, I can see where we are replicating facilities and opportunities on both sides of the Border which might be better shared. Such an approach is one I commend to the Minister and I hope, all the other arguments aside, that this focus will be given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has been and will be responsible and constructive on this issue, but we will not tolerate scapegoating householders anywhere on the island or labelling us all as polluters as a substitute for a proper waste management policy. I urge the Minister's favourable consideration of a cross-Border approach and again record my opposition to incineration and my support for a waste management policy which honestly addresses and reflects the concerns and needs of citizens. I register my opposition to the Bill and my intention to support the Labour Party amendments in relation to waiver schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about householders and I am here to speak on their behalf. We have seen in the past few weeks in this city how people elected to councils were more concerned with big fellows who had money than small people. I have got into trouble on many occasions at estimates meetings fighting for the poor and the week in society. I hope the Minister will concede that there will have to be a waiver for people living in local authority housing and for the elderly.</P>
      <P>On the one hand the State is providing grant aid through the IDA to major companies locating in the country. These companies are producing and creating more waste than 1,000 householders would create yet we are subsidising them by giving them grant aid for buildings, machinery, etc., while poor people in housing estates have to pay for a refuse service, something which amazes me.</P>
      <P>I pay rates, water charges and refuse charges but I receive no service from the local authority. They do not sweep outside my door or clean the drains, jobs I have to do myself. I have been a member of a local authority for 21 years and I must say the structure is collapsing. I am a member of Mayo County Council and each year we are appointing more engineers and fewer tradesmen. We cannot get a man to sweep the streets because the council will not employ people, or a man to open a drain because the council says it does not have the necessary resources. I opposed the proposal last week to include provision for the tenure of county managers to be increased from seven to ten years in the Planning and Development Bill. County managers run the country, not the Taoiseach or Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in the bread business for 20 years at a time when it was not necessary to wrap bread. People then came to us from the health boards to prosecute us because we were not keeping the bread clean and wrapped. In the milk industry, every morning housewives would wash the empty <Col N="841" /> bottles and leave them out for collection by the milk company to be refilled. Similarly, in the summer children used to collect mineral bottles, bring them to the local shops and collect a few pounds in deposits. Now, however, everything is disposable, including bags, bottles and drink cans, and we know where this material ends up.</P>
    <P>The other day a constituent came to my clinic who got a £40 fine for throwing away a cigarette butt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not rightly so. The Minister was approached by residents from County Kildare where a developer had been dumping for four or five years. The county manager, the assistant county manager, every official on the local authority and the Minister were approached on the matter and none of them did anything about it. The residents had to raise money and go to the courts, and I am glad to say they won the case. That person was creating a dump on his property, so much so that the local authority felt it would cost too much to remove it, but I am glad the courts dealt with the person involved. He was prosecuted and must now rectify the damage he did.</P>
      <P>A private operator in my town, who has lovely vehicles and works late and hard, had to put his refuse in a landfill dump owned by the council. The council took all the prime business in the towns while this person catered for all the rural business. The council doubled if not tripled the charges for that man to use the landfill, something which is wrong.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed by the service provided by local authorities. There is a parallel here with water charges. The Minister is aware that there are many people in rural areas who are prepared to pay for water if it is provided. Water charges were being abolished in Dublin and throughout the country while at the same time people were trying to collect money to put water schemes in place where the State failed to provide a service. The person who creates refuse must pay for its disposal. The business sector must pay a reasonable charge.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are always complaining they never have money yet, at a meeting the other night of the local authority of which I am a member, the county manager, without consultation, introduced grants of £40,000 and £70,000 for different golf clubs, giving in the end a total of £140,000. People in rural areas cannot travel the roads because of overgrown hedges which the county manager says he has no money to cut yet he could spend £140,000 on golf clubs. I am not a golfer and I have nothing against golf. However, those who can afford to play it can afford to pay for it, and I do not see why rate payers and taxpayers have to subsidise golf courses which have already been subsidised in terms of grant aid for their construction. I am upset and annoyed by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it will not be like the water charges <Col N="842" /> where more money was being collected from housing estates than from the business sector. Local authorities were adding water charges to rent, and those who did not pay were in trouble, which was wrong. The person who creates waste &ndash; manufacturers, industrialists and business people &ndash; should have to pay, not the poor woman, the single mother or the person with a large family living in a housing estate. There must be a waiver.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are unable to deal with existing problems, including planning, housing and existing services. Nothing is being done in relation to repairs to council houses and I do not understand why the Minister is giving councils responsibility in terms of refuse.</P>

        <b>:</b> The ramming through of legislation, which we have had sight of for scarcely 24 hours, amounts to disgraceful bullying by the Government. I was only informed late yesterday evening that this emergency debate would be held and that all Stages of the Bill would be railroaded through the House this evening. That is a gross abuse of democracy and does not allow adequate time to address the serious issues raised by this legislation because once the question of local authority charges is raised, it is inevitable that we must go back to the principle on which they are levied and their history.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to validate the illegal collection of £100 million by local authorities, mainly in refuse charges, in 1997, 1998, 1999 and so far in 2000. It is quite clear that the Attorney General would not have gone to the Government with this advice unless he was absolutely convinced that charges for those years would not survive a challenge in the courts. Most of the £100 million arises from a bin tax on ordinary householders. It is a local tax bearing most heavily on that section of the population which already pays the majority of taxes in the State. Since these charges were introduced by Deputy Spring and Fine Gael in 1983 they have remained the subject of contention, opposition and resentment for ordinary taxpayers. Their introduction at that time amounted to a double cross of honest PAYE workers who were taxed to the hilt and who funded the bulk of the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These charges were a source of contention in the 1980s and if the decent people objecting to them then only knew what else was going on at that time behind closed doors these charges would only have survived a matter of months because of the injustice involved. While the ordinary taxpayer was called upon to pay over and over again, through this back door local tax, powerful swindlers were in action in other sectors of the economy ripping off the tax system to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds. The most powerful individuals in the State, captains of industry and establishment politicians, were stashing hundreds of millions of pounds in off<Col N="843" /> shore accounts to avoid paying tax with which the ordinary PAYE worker was hit.</P>
    <P>These workers were called upon to pay this local tax, which was an out and out unjust charge. Many quite correctly did not pay. Water charges were struck down in 1996 as a result of a campaign of people power. They were outraged by the double standards in taxation which they faced and the audacity of major right wing parties to introduce these taxes at local authority level which was then followed in 1993 by the Fianna Fáil/Labour Party Government introducing a tax amnesty to legitimise millionaire swindlers who had robbed hundreds of millions of pounds and being given <i>carte blánche</i> to get away with it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> When that campaign of people power, with no support whatsoever from the political parties of the establishment in the House, forced the abolition of charges it was a blow for justice for the ordinary taxpayer. It struck me strongly last night when I heard about this legislation that declaring such charges to be illegal from 1997 onwards is poetic justice as far as ordinary householders are concerned because following the abolition of water charges the Attorney General is telling us that the remaining charge, the bin tax, is also illegal. By accident rather than by design on behalf of the establishment parties, we find that ordinary people were robbed again through this tax.</P>
      <P>The Government is coming into the House at a few hours notice to ram through this emergency legislation because the little people are involved, such as the PAYE pensioners, the low paid workers and those who pay the majority of taxes. The little people must never be allowed any tax breaks and that is why the Government is coming into the House in this fashion. Did it introduce any emergency legislation to target the Ansbacher men in order to extract the hundreds of millions of pounds they owe the tax system over the past 20 years or more? It is three years since the Government fought tooth and nail against those of us in the House who wanted the tribunals to pursue the Ansbacher men. It has introduced emergency legislation to ensure the little people do not escape the tax burden but has done nothing about the big fish. I have no doubt that the big fish made large political donations to certain right wing parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has introduced this legislation on an unfortunate day following the stunning revelations at Dublin Castle which, unfortunately, discredit local authorities because of the outright corruption of a minority of councillors which is now patently obvious. The same people who took bribes had no compunction about going into council chambers and lashing local taxes on the hard pressed PAYE worker. I was a councillor fighting them in 1991 and what I knew then I <Col N="844" /> now know to be the truth. The councillors who introduced this local tax on ordinary people have no moral authority and the Government has no moral authority to come into the House and insist that £100 million in taxation which was illegally grabbed from the decent tax paying public must be kept by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Bin charges should be scrapped and the Government should provide adequate local authority funding to address waste management. Bin charges do not comprise a policy on waste management. The trite slogan &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo;, which is used by some political parties to cover their tracks, equates the decent householder to a chemical factory. It is quite sickening. The majority of landfill waste is commercial, not domestic. The majority of household waste could be reduced to nil if there was proper and strict legislation beginning at manufacturing level to reduce waste at source. It is ridiculous that when one enters a supermarket one still finds foam trays containing one or two sausages. Is it any wonder that waste piles up in landfills? The Government adopts programmes of reuse and recycling to eliminate unnecessary waste production.</P>
    <P> Plastic bags have been mentioned and they are a blight which the Government has done nothing about. The plastic bag should be adopted as the national flag. Any visitor coming to our shores would then think we were the most patriotic people on earth because every bush, briar and boreen flies the national flag as a result of plastic pollution. The Government pathetically adopts the trite slogan, &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; in order to impose extra local taxes on decent taxpayers. It is not interested in implementing a proper waste management strategy. There is a boycott of these waste charges in many places and I expect more to follow. People should not pay these charges, they should boycott them and come together in political lobby to force their public representatives to recognise that these charges should be abolished. The Government should be on notice that this will be an issue in the run up to the next general election. I had thought it might be in 12 months time but, judging by what has spilled out in Dublin Castle in the last 48 hours, it might be in a matter of weeks. There is probably more and worse to come and who knows in whose courtyard it will land? </P>
    <P>There is a serious question mark over the legality of what the Government is attempting to do. The Minister has not addressed that and he must do so. It is very possible that under Article 15.5 of the Constitution the High Court will strike down this Bill. I have no doubt that it will finish up in the High Court and so it should. As well as a campaign of people power and a boycott of these charges to demand justice, the ordinary householder should use the courts to secure justice. According to Article 15.5 of the Constitution, the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission. The refusal by householders to pay in 1997, 1998 and 1999 cannot be <Col N="845" /> said to be an infringement of the law now because it was an illegal and invalid act to demand that money at the time. The Oireachtas may not retrospectively say that this was an infringement of the law. The Minister has been well briefed about this. He knows there is a law which says that no one should suffer a detriment by the application of a doubtful law and there is also a question mark over retrospection of legislation. This will end up in the High Court and that is only right.</P>
    <P>Today we see yet another shameful double crossing of the people by the Government, once more it is ignoring them and it will pay the price for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems with refuse collection and the imposed charges are causing concern. In Offaly private contractors collect refuse and their charges are roughly £160 per year &ndash; £13.50 per month. That is a lot of money to those on low incomes. There has never been an overall Government strategy for the collection of refuse. A comprehensive policy must be put in place to ensure uniformity throughout the State.</P>
      <P>Many dumps had to close because of European Union regulations. There is no problem closing a dump but problems arise when a new dump has to be opened. This demonstrates a lack of common sense on the part of the European Union. Those dumps which remain open are almost full and there will be problems shortly finding alternative sites for dumping.</P>
      <P>The charges have risen from £50 a year to at least £160 per year in some areas. I am very concerned about the manner in which those charges are rising. The Minister and the local authorities will have to act. When one speaks to those carrying out collection on behalf of the local authorities, the response will be that the local authorities have increased their charges at the gates of the rubbish dumps. The local authorities are responsible for a proportion of these increases. Overall, there is much dissatisfaction with the charges.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the national car test will aggravate the already serious problem of abandoned cars. There is no plan to get rid of these cars. Throughout Laois-Offaly there are abandoned cars lying in scenic areas and they are a blight on the environment. The money being obtained from the tests should be used to ensure that abandoned cars are removed and properly dismantled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a major crisis in housing. Day after day people come to me looking for housing. When I entered politics there were problems in this area but the Rainbow Government did a great deal to reduce the waiting lists. Since Fianna Fáil returned to power, the housing lists have grown at an uncontrollable rate. We are forgetting those who cannot afford to buy houses and they feel abandoned. Families of five who are living in the worst possible accommodation come to my clinic and I have to tell them that they will be on a waiting list for years. This problem must be <Col N="846" /> addressed. The worst housing crisis we have ever experienced is currently taking place when the State has never been better off. RTE highlighted the problems in the private rented sector and those problems are being aggravated by the lack of housing available. A major initiative must be taken by the Government to tackle this crisis.</P>

      <P>I refer to other problems which have arisen. I have been in contact with the Minister's Department on a number of occasions in regard to sewerage problems. I received letters from the Minister on the Mountrath, Abbeyleix and Durrow sewerage schemes which have not been improved for the past 50 to 80 years. I thank the Minister for his letter in which he stated they are included in the scheme of assessment of needs 2000-06. These towns will not be able to develop unless proper sewerage facilities are provided. I ask the Minister to deal with these schemes because a number of people have raised this matter with me. He might also examine the scheme at Ballybrittas.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the refuse issue. Material is being dumped everywhere and it is time for a national comprehensive approach to tackle the problem of dumping. We are missing out as a country because the dumping problem has been allowed to develop over the years.</P>

The House will have noted from my opening speech that the purpose of this Bill is specific. It is simply to confirm the commonly understood position regarding the powers currently available to local authorities to charge for certain services.

      <P>I thought they might have had the good grace to accept their responsibility for the fact that we are here this evening but, as usual, my faith in the Labour Party was badly misplaced.</P>
      <P>Much was said about the fact that we are dealing with this matter by way of emergency legislation whereas other issues of importance to society did not receive similar treatment. If we are to address a legal doubt, it has to be done by legislation &ndash; hence the Bill. I make no apology for moving to remove a legal doubt before any legal proceedings are brought to my attention.</P>
      <P>The attitude in certain quarters of the Opposition seemed to be that I should have sat back, waited until there was a court challenge and to be hauled into the court something about it. That may be the way certain Members of the Opposition want to act but it is not the way this Government will act. We will face up to our responsibilities and the problems and try to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Not all the important issues facing us require emergency legislation. The broader environmental, housing and other issues raised are being addressed head on by this Government through a wide range of measures and initiatives which are being implemented with unprecedented determination. There is a striking similarity between this legislation and the housing area mentioned by so many Deputies. The similarity is that we are left in a position in which we have to clear up the mess created by the previous Government, but we are doing that and we will shoulder our responsibility.</P>

A question was raised by consultants engaged by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to advise on public-private partnerships &ndash; the PP initiatives about which we talked &ndash; for the purpose of implementing regional waste management plans. Shortly after that and independent of the Department advice and the doubt being raised, advice to the same effect was received by Dublin Corporation which is considering specific proposals for domestic waste charges as provided for in the Dublin region waste management plan. That is the background to the&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dukes and others specifically asked about the background.</P>
      <P>In regard to another question raised by Deputy Dukes, as far as we are aware there is no legal challenge currently to the validity of the local authority waste charges. That is the best information we have. Any legal action would probably be taken against the local authority rather than the Department.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked why we are rushing this emergency legislation through now. One thing which was notably absent from any of the contributions was the possible effects of this if we did not take action and remove the doubt, that is, a serious loss of revenue to local authorities. Deputies on all sides constantly tell me how committed they are to local democracy, local government and the local authority system but nobody seems to care about them when they are faced with the possibility of a £100 million loss, and I cannot put it more strongly than that. That is why this legislation was introduced.</P>
      <P>More importantly, once a doubt arises over the validity of any charge levied by local authorities, there is the possibility that it could, in a broader sense, undermine the entire income local authorities have included in their estimates for 2000. Should a notion gain currency at some stage that any charge levied by a local authority is unfounded in law, it could sow the seeds of uncertainty and doubt in regard to all their charges and could possibly start a movement against payment of all valid charges and payments which are critical to local authorities. Such an outcome could undermine the financial position of local authorities and, therefore, their ability to provide necessary services to an acceptable standard. I do not think anybody in this House would like to contemplate anything like that and it is for that reason we moved as fast as we did.</P>
      <P>Charges form a very important part of the income of local authorities. On the basis of the Estimates for 1999, it is estimated that charges for goods and services contributed £443 million to local authorities out of current expenditure of £1.6 billion. That is about 27% of their total income. Because of the doubt, the potential for increased uncertainty and the adverse effects it would have on the local government system, I felt it was important to act quickly.</P>

      <P>Deputies Gilmore and Dukes wanted to see a written opinion. I have no written opinion. A judgment was formed, and confirmed by the Attorney General, that a doubt could be held to apply in relation to the validity of charges. As is clearly laid out in the Bill, this legislation is without prejudice to any existing legal challenge. That is contained in section 4 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dukes asked about the possibility of legal proceedings to date. I am not aware of any existing challenge, and the Bill will obviate any future such proceedings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes raised the question of obstacles to future legislation and the possibility that this would prevent local authorities at some stage in the future from taking or being given powers to charge for services under existing legislation. I assure the Deputy that there is no fear of that. This is to rectify a situation that has arisen between 1997 and now. Any future legislation will be able to operate on its own merits. Questions were also asked about arrears of charges. I have no information about the level of arrears of charges or what is outstanding at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputies have asked what is at issue in relation to waste charges and why the introduction of legislation is the route we have taken. In the speech I made, which is available in written format for the Deputies, I made it quite clear what we are trying to do. I will not, therefore, waste the time of the House in outlining it again.</P>
      <P>Another Deputy raised the spectre that this is a way of introducing charges by the back door. We are merely legislating for what people thought was in existence for the past three years. We are not introducing new charges.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to promptly address the element of doubt which has arisen. The question of waivers was raised. Waivers are a matter for individual local authorities. To my knowledge, most local authorities that continue to provide a refuse collection service provide some form of waiver. That is a matter for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard the hoary old argument that the levying of waste charges by local authorities is double taxation. That does not stand up to scrutiny, especially in the current circumstances where the Government has ensured unprecedented annual reductions in income and other <Col N="850" /> central taxation and where householders automatically receive a credit for waste charges against their income tax. In many cases local authorities operate a waiver system for people who are on low income or who are not in the income tax net.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has made it clear that there is a legal requirement on EU member states to ensure that, in accordance with the principle that the polluter pays, there is a charge for waste disposal applicable to all waste producers. I do not know what kind of Utopia Deputy Higgins lives in, but we are all waste producers, whether we are householders or commercial operators. Commercial operators have to pay waste charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it might be. To the extent that Irish local authorities exempt householders from waste charges, the Commission considers itself justified in taking an infringement proceeding against Ireland under Article 169 of the Treaty. The Commission has indicated that it is reviewing progress in relation to the introduction of household waste charges to determine whether or not to initiate such proceedings against Ireland, and Community funds cannot be used for any waste project if a system of waste charges consistent with the requirements of EU legislation is not in place in this regard. The Commission has suspended and may revoke Cohesion Fund grant assistance of more than £6.5 million in respect of South Dublin County Council's baling station at Ballymount because we do not have charges in place in that area or did not have until recently.</P>
      <P>I am delighted Deputy Gormley has returned to the Chamber. On the last few occasions on which I wanted to reply to him, he was not in the Chamber. For his information, eight proceedings were taken under the Waste Management Act against firms who were not involved in Repak. The cases were struck out by the District Court because of an unrelated planning judgment relating to the local authority's powers to take proceedings in the courts. The court stated further that cases should not be taken until the other issue was resolved. That matter is being resolved and an amendment to legislation is being prepared.</P>

    <P>Deputy Gormley and the Green Party manage to be on the side of angels at all times. They constantly tell us how important environmental matters are, how important it is that basic principles <Col N="851" /> are followed. They tell us about the polluter pays principle. They tell us all about prevention and minimisation, all very laudable principles on which Government policy is based. However, when it comes to hard decisions in this House or in the local authorities they run for cover. Tonight we saw a perfect example of that. They are using a fig leaf to distance themselves from their stated adherence to the polluter pays principle. We hear all sorts of pious platitudes until hard decisions have to be made. I am sure Deputy Gormley's colleagues in Europe would be horrified if they read his contribution to this debate. He has distanced himself completely from the polluter pays principle. It has nothing to do with him. If a person is a supporter of Deputy Gormley, he should not have to pay.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate. It is evident, given the contributions last night and particularly the Minister's contribution, there is a need for a Shannon River authority. I have had no doubt about the need for such an authority for a number of years. I grew up by the Shannon, beside the head race, as it joins Ardnacrusha with the river at Killaloe, and have had an interest in the River Shannon since my youth. I am saddened at the deterioration of many aspects of the River Shannon over the years, particularly the deterioration in the water quality. That is one of the most important issues that needs to be addressed although the flooding is the immediate concern. There are many other concerns that need to be addressed. It is important that a River Shannon authority is set up as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I participated in the water quality management plans for the estuary area, the Shannon and Lough Derg as a member of a local authority. Subsequently, the mid-west regional authority, of which I am a former member, dealt with Lough Derg. In the course of these debates it became obvious there are a large number of bodies involved. Last night there were various estimates ranging from 29 statutory bodies to more than 30 bodies involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one tries to get something done, whether to clear silt, build up banks or to improve the water quality, inevitably one has to deal with a number of local authorities and various other bodies. I do not think we need to make the argument for the necessity of setting up such an authority. Given that the River Shannon flows downwards, various things that happen up-stream in a particular area affect what happens lower down the river. In regard to silt, drainage and so on, there is a real problem about who is responsible for addressing these issues. In his contribution, the Minister said his responsibility is limited in the whole area of waterways and that most of the bodies were outside his control. In effect, there is no scope for co-ordination. Even though there is a forum there is no solid legislative backing for the operation of such a <Col N="855" /> forum. Therefore, it is essential that we move as quickly as possible to set up an authority.</P>
    <P>I question the Minister's proposal to transfer the issue to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. It is important that the Bills which have been drafted, particularly the Labour Party Bill, are actively considered and that having the joint committee examine the proposal does not become another time wasting exercise.</P>
    <P>My constituency suffered serious flooding last Christmas. I acknowledge the provision of a compensation fund of £250,000 and the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in providing that funding for flood relief. I look forward to hearing more details regarding the fund but it is right that people who lost furniture and household equipment and who saw their homes destroyed should be helped. Other Deputies have referred to the traumatic effect of flooding on farmers and householders in other areas. Many of us have seen the destruction at first hand. It is important that people who have suffered are compensated.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that such a thing does not happen again. To do so we must establish an authority to co-ordinate the activities of the various local authorities, the Office of Public Works, the ESB, Bord na Móna and other bodies to ensure a co-ordinated approach to solving the problems of the River Shannon. Limerick Corporation has sent proposals to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the strengthening of river banks and the making of other provisions to ensure that the threat of flooding can be minimised and, if possible, eliminated. Complications arise in Limerick from the navigation scheme in the Abbey River and the main drainage scheme in Limerick city. However, all Deputies who have a connection to the River Shannon, its tributaries and its catchment area are agreed on the need to co-ordinate the activities of the various bodies in the Shannon catchment area.</P>
    <P>Water quality has deteriorated seriously in various parts of the Shannon, its tributaries and lakes and this important issue must be addressed as soon as possible. It is a complicated issue with a number of contributory factors. Waste from agricultural and domestic sources as well as from Bord na Móna contribute to the problem and these factors need to be co-ordinated. I would love to see the return of bathing in the River Shannon in Limerick and along the length of the river and its lakes. It is particularly sad to see the deterioration of lakes such as Lough Derg which used to be clear and a pleasure to swim in but which have become nutrified. The River Shannon authority must be given the power to deal effectively with the various bodies which are polluting the river and its tributaries and restore the water to the clean condition we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>The involvement of various bodies, particularly local authorities, must be clarified so that we know <Col N="856" /> who is responsible for the various works which need to be carried out. Expertise in dealing with flooding must be brought together and an effective strategy put in place to ensure that people will not endure the suffering of last winter when they had to leave their houses during the Christmas period. Irrespective of what happens to this Bill, the question of flooding must be addressed. Urgent measures must be taken to minimise the danger of flooding. It is accepted that the river has a flood plain and that some flooding cannot be avoided. However, we must ensure that flooding does not occur in places where it can be prevented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Doherty, Ellis and Daly.</P>
      <P>The formation of a Shannon River authority has been on the political agenda for decades at least. Ten local authorities, several State and semi-State bodies and other bodies have a legitimate and strong interest in the river. It is extremely difficult to envisage a meaningful, proactive and all encompassing role for an overall authority. Would it be some kind of referee between frequently competing and sometimes mutually exclusive interests or would it have a separate additional function currently not within the ambit of any of the existing bodies? If it had either role or both, how would it be constituted and, more importantly, how would it be funded?</P>
      <P>I am aware of the now infamous Seanad Bill and its provisions. However, considerable work needs to be done and it will best be done by the joint committee as the Minister proposes. Many people who have been familiar with difficulties in the Shannon for a number of years would have been surprised to hear of the responsibilities of bodies such as the Office of Public Works, the ESB, Waterways Ireland and other bodies. I am sure many people thought that the Office of Public Works had a far greater range of powers relating to the Shannon than it has.</P>
      <P>When I was a young boy, I remember an election campaign being fought on the issue of draining the River Fergus. At the same time there were proposals to drain the Shannon and many other local rivers. Most of these proposals came to nought. Almost every initiative or study mentioned by the Minister last night was prompted by a severe flooding incident. He explained that there are reports of various kinds going back 200 years. The Minister said that a dozen or so reports dating from 1938 all come to the same conclusion regarding a problem for which there is no simple solution. Any solution, however it might impact on the situation, would be both complex and costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flooding in December 1954 led to the Rydell report which was published in 1956. That report recommended that a River Shannon inter-agency commission be set up but it also recommended that the commission be advisory rather than have executive powers. The joint committee will have to <Col N="857" /> address the extent of the powers to be exercised by any new body which might be set up. It will be very difficult to reach a determination on that matter but I am confident that the joint committee will do so.</P>
    <P>The most recent report was that commissioned by the IFA from Delap and Waller. This came to similar conclusions and stated that no obvious engineering works would address the problems in a meaningful way. Since then the forum established by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has done extremely useful work. When it comes to examining the matter and plot a course forward the joint committee will find that some of the work done by the forum has considerable potential and is a useful reference point.</P>
    <P>I come from a farming family and have seen at first hand the devastating effects of flooding on low lying land and the potential of a farmer to develop his property. I have visited homes devastated by flooding in my constituency and elsewhere in the country. It is understandable that people would look to central government and the authorities to come up with a solution which in the medium to long-term will promise some relief from the suffering they have to endure.</P>
    <P>Apart from the immediate effects of flooding on farm families and others there is the consideration of water quality which is becoming increasingly important to ordinary people. At one time those with an interest in fishing were saying that there were difficulties with water quality in Lough Derg and elsewhere but now the wider community has its concerns. The Minister of State referred to the need for the joint committee to include this among the matters to be considered in its consideration of the River Shannon and the huge catchment area affected by it. I wish the joint committee well in its deliberations and look forward to its report in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the motion and addendum tabled by the Opposition parties which have made a significant contribution to the debate on the question with which we are dealing and with which I hope we will have a further opportunity to deal at the joint committee. Equally I acknowledge the response of the Government and hope the House will not divide at the conclusion of these proceedings. The joint committee should be afforded an opportunity to look at this complex question in a mature and reasonable way.</P>
      <P>While there are no simple answers, there must be a genuine search to find solutions to those aspects which cause considerable difficulties and hardship for homeowners and members of the farming community whose lands are flooded annually resulting in significant losses. While we cannot control the rainfall, there is an obligation on us to ensure the position of such persons is acknowledged by Government and a remedy found within the political system. I hope this and a number of other issues will be addressed by the joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> There are over 30 statutory and voluntary organisations which have a direct or indirect interest in the River Shannon and its tributaries. To ignore the impact of flooding on its tributaries would be to turn a blind eye and I am not prepared to do that. The influence of the River Shannon and its tributaries on the island as a whole is considerable. It impacts on one-fifth of the land mass, is the longest river on these islands and it is a wonderful national asset. Despite this, responsibility for its management has not been assigned to a single authority. This must be taken into account by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>Annually the River Shannon is seen in a negative light which causes great hardship and grave loss for a considerable number of people. Despite this it has wonderful potential which we cannot afford to ignore. Those resident in its immediate catchment area should not be deprived of the benefits that would accrue from an acknowledgment that it is a national asset. Its potential for development has not been focused on in an imaginative way and needs to be the subject of examination.</P>
    <P>The protection of the River Shannon also needs to be taken into account. It is a special physical feature with an enormous contribution to make. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, it has suffered in recent years in such a way that its potential may be damaged to some degree in the short-term and seriously damaged over a period. This is not good enough. We do not need to be guided in its protection by outside agencies; we should be mature and wise enough as a people to know its importance and that it is in danger of losing its qualities. In time it may be the source of water for the entire country. The quality of its water contributes to the quality of life within the river and has a massive impact on its amenity value.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon must be looked at in the context of the promotional opportunities that if offers and its value, not least to the tourism industry. We do not have time to deal in great detail with all the aspects that must be looked at and examined. They should be the subject of serious deliberation, advice and an extraordinary and extensive consultation process involving the many statutory and voluntary organisations and agencies which have a vested interest in the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon has been a source of power during the years. This has given rise to conflicts with other interests to which solutions must be found.</P>
    <P>The fisheries along the River Shannon are part of a major industry. If one compares the way the River Shannon has been neglected with developments on Lough Neagh one will quickly realise that the River Shannon has a contribution to make to the economy. Suitable industries can be located within its catchment area, of which farming is the backbone. Farming can sustain families on the land with supplementary income from <Col N="859" /> other activities connected with the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>The flora and fauna associated with the River Shannon are both unusual and different and should be preserved for future generations. Ornithology is also of interest to many along the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that any party should be denied a political contest if that is what it wants but there are so many aspects to be considered that we should try to reach consensus rather than vote on this issue. I compliment the Opposition parties for tabling the motion and addendum which have received a positive response from the Government which in its amendment is suggesting that the matter be referred to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, which I am honoured and privileged to chair. I have no doubt the committee and its members will make every effort to examine this issue in a balanced, mature and enlightened manner.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most important debates in terms of the economic, social and environmental importance of the Shannon. I hope we reach a consensus and that progress is made on this issue as a result of it being sent to the committee. I hope the Government acts as quickly as possible on any report laid before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis:</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of this House frequently hear about the problems relating to the Shannon which seem to occur every eight to ten years or at certain times of the year when there are flash floods. The flooding at Christmas, which lasted for some time, made people realise that something had to be done about it. We can all throw our hands up in the air and say it is an act of God. However, acts of God will happen irrespective of what we try to do here. Crises should be managed and there is a need for a proper management plan to deal with the Shannon.</P>
      <P>The Shannon is the drainage system for a large part of the west, the northwest and as far south as Limerick. It has all the problems associated with a long meandering river. It is slow and its fall is poor in many sections which causes widespread flooding. Carrick-on-Shannon, which is high up on the Shannon, had not seen anything like the flooding it suffered at Christmas. People said it happened because the sluice gates on Lough Allen were open. However, I was told by the Office of Public Works today that the sluice gates were open prior to the flooding. If they were open, it was to prevent further flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Office of Public Works and the ESB have been at cross purposes in the management of the Shannon over the years and that this has led to some of the problems. Everyone accepts there is a need for a Shannon authority to manage the Shannon. The Shannon is not only an important tourist attraction, but a source of water for many towns. All of south Leitrim uses <Col N="860" /> water taken from the Shannon at Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    <P>The referral of this issue to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport provides a good opportunity to draw up a management plan for the Shannon so it is developed to its maximum potential. It also gives people an opportunity to make submissions. People should have the right to express their fears and concerns to members of Oireachtas committees and to outline their views on what can be done to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the damage to household property. The damage to farm property and to farms was so serious that much of the land flooded will have little or no productive use this year. That will be a considerable loss to the farmers concerned. This is an opportunity to adopt a co-ordinated approach to the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts the tourism potential of the Shannon. Cruising boats and anglers have generated considerable revenue in the Shannon basin over the past 25 or 30 years. The committee must consider its further development. This great resource will play a major role in the country's future development. We do not want to see it abused or pollution becoming a bigger problem. The referral of this issue to the committee provides an opportunity to compile a report on the management and development of the Shannon. We do not want people to face the trauma they faced last Christmas or this natural resource to be damaged by pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this brief but important opportunity to contribute to this debate. I appeal to Members to adopt an all-party approach to this issue because it has been the subject of politicking for some time. It is time to lay the politics aside. I was glad to hear the contributions of Opposition Deputies last night. The time has come for all of us to get together in the committee and chart the future development of the Shannon catchment, while bearing in mind the importance of the catchment and its huge potential to generate economic activity in the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Shannon has made an important contribution to the development of fisheries, tourism, navigation systems and the leisure, amenity and recreational facilities of the catchment. The Shannon was harnessed at Ardnacrusha, at the instigation of the first Government, and the establishment of the power station had and continues to have a major economic impact. Apart from its leisure, amenity and recreational value, the Shannon has made a contribution to our economic prosperity and development and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> It is not acceptable that people had to leave their homes last Christmas and in recent years because of flooding and that little action has been taken by successive Governments to deal with it. I compliment the local communities who have suffered the problems in the upper Shannon for so long and the representatives of the farming community and other voluntary bodies who were members of the forum, which was set up by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, for their dedicated work. They worked with the State agencies, Departments and county councils.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable and unjustifiable that people's homes have been severely flooded and it must be rectified. The committee must consider what needs to be done either through legislation or other measures and it must include some form of compensation. That was one of the shortcomings of the legislation introduced by the Opposition and by Deputy Penrose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Shannon is a huge natural resource which can be harnessed further. The tragedy has been that the Shannon catchment was used for generations as a disposal unit for refuse, sewage and effluent. Many local authorities have to take responsibility for failing to deal with this issue for generations. The result is that there was a disastrous situation in Lough Derg, a devastating effect on Shannon fisheries and the potential of the Shannon and its basin has not been utilised to the full for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> We now have an opportunity to address this issue. The Bill I formulated and other legislation are just part of a formula which must be put in place. I am confident that this formula will be properly dealt with by the committee and the sub-committee and it can put in place a framework to ensure the continued maximisation of the Shannon's tourism, leisure, recreational and amenity value and its economic importance. Above all, it is unfair and unreasonable that people in the catchment area are still subject to the devastating effects of flooding. Some compensation arrangement has to be built into any new framework for such communities and individuals.</P>
    <P>A recent meeting of the sub-committee chaired by Deputy Doherty elected Deputy Penrose as Vice-Chairman. On behalf of Fine Gael, Deputy Connaughton pledged his full support. All sides at the meeting acknowledged that the different legislation put together in Private Members' time needed to be placed on a proper framework and footing and that the Government was responsible for doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Office of Public Works should take the lead on this as they have the engineering and design capabilities for framing an overall scheme which can work successfully. They have worked successfully in draining the flash floods on the Mulcaire and in other catchments. Under the Department of Finance funding will be available to deal with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>European funding has also been available to deal with these matters which can be looked at in the context of the sub-committee and the committee which will have the responsibility under the new arrangements being put in place.</P>
      <P>Legislation must provide for an overall authority with responsibility for the Shannon which is able to take decisive action to deal speedily and effectively with emergencies. Such an authority does not exist. Instead, a number of agencies and Departments have responsibility and what is everybody's responsiblity is no one's responsiblity. If a sudden problem emerges at Meelick which requires remedial action at Ardnacrusha, someone in authority should be able to direct the ESB to take that action. The problem is that different agencies have their own responsibility but none has overall responsibility, as acknowledged by the Minister of State in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should not divide on this issue. Instead, we should go into the committee identified as the body to bring together the various Departments and local authorities. That committee can also call on the advice of voluntary organisations and bodies who deal with this issue on a day-to-day basis. Many of these bodies contributed to the forum but recognised that, because it was a non-statutory body, it did not have the authority to deal effectively with some of these matters. Legislation will be necessary but it must be comprehensive. It also needs to be placed on <Col N="863" /> a footing which will enable reasonable compensation and relocation to be provided for those who have suffered undue hardship because of flooding. This issue cannot be ignored in the development of a scheme to deal with the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The contributions of Fianna Fáil, and Deputy Daly in particular, are more appropriate to &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo; than any serious attempt to address this problem given the Government's voting record in this House and in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>As well as being critical of the Government and the Minister, I also wish to be critical of the four principal State agencies who are wringing their hands of responsibility for the River Shannon. The ESB, Bord na Móna, the Office of Public Works and Dúchas are in continuous denial of responsibility when dealing with this issue. The principal question which has been dodged for years is who is responsible for the control and maintenance of water levels on the Shannon? The ESB regularly holds back water at Ardnacrusha and repeated allegations are made that this is done, particularly in the spring and autumn. These allegations have never been properly investigated and are always denied by the ESB.</P>
      <P>There has also been much criticism of Bord na Móna over the years for silt and peat deposits from the River Brosna and other rivers in the midlands. These allegations have never been properly investigated and Bord na Móna also flatly denies them. Over the years, the Office of Public Works has faced allegations that the Shannon has narrowed in many areas because it is overgrown with weeds and rushes. This has never been properly investigated although it is obvious in many areas. The Office of Public Works also flatly denies these allegations.</P>
      <P>In 1996, responsibility was transferred from the Office of Public Works to Dúchas, an arm of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Dúchas flatly denies any responsibility for maintenance of the Shannon and claims that its responsibility only extends to summer months. It denies responsibility for maintenance and flooding. We have had denials from the ESB, Bord na Mona, the Office of Public Works, Dúchas, the Minister and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all these agencies are in denial, no Minister or Department has overall responsibility for the Shannon with bleak consequences for people living the catchment area, particularly smallholders and farmers whose incomes suffer annually as land remains flooded for almost six months. The only solution is that proposed by Deputy Connaughton for an overall River Shannon authority, not at some time in the future, but now. Otherwise this situation will deteriorate even further <Col N="864" /> with further hardship and suffering for thousands of people in the Shannon catchment area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's attitude is a major disappointment to all from the midlands and the Shannon area. A few months ago in the Shamrock Lodge the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, gave a pledge and claimed that she could not get back to Dublin quick enough to put the Shannon authority in place and provide compensation for the unfortunate people. She named most of them that day because she had been to visit them. It is obvious now that she only went as a PR exercise of the sort for which this Government &ndash; the Government of the spin doctor &ndash; is known. However, it cannot spin its way out of this. The reality is that every time the Shannon floods, land and houses are under water and people's pride and interest in farming and ordinary day-to-day life is damaged once again.</P>
      <P>How many times have we heard that nobody has responsibility for the drainage of the Shannon? However, people have responsibility for every river that goes into the Shannon. There is proper drainage legislation for rivers which go into the Shannon, such as the Suck and the Brosna, but there is no drainage for the river itself.</P>
      <P>This Government has all the money and is drunk on champagne. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has told us all to get drunk on champagne. However, there is no champagne in the Shannon valley. The Taoiseach announced today, probably rightly so, that they will spend £0.5 billion on the new sports complex in Dublin. The Minister should say that slowly and think about it. Yet the Government cannot afford to do anything on the Shannon for the unfortunate people living and working there, who are entitled to live happily without the hassle they suffered last Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I live in the area concerned. I travelled from Banagher to Shannon Harbour to Shannonbridge during the floods last winter. It was like looking across the Atlantic. The floods were five miles across the countryside. I had not seen anything like it before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a duty to establish a Shannon river authority. It is essential that such an independent body would have overall control of the Shannon. The authority we want set up would comprise representatives from the farming community, tourism interests, fisheries, wildlife and conservation interests, as well as the existing statutory bodies, such as the Office of Public Works, the ESB and local authorities. Such an authority would deal with the flow and quality of the river, with the express intention of ensuring that Ireland's largest river would be managed to maximum advantage for farmers, householders, people involved in recreational activities, such as <Col N="865" /> fishing, boating and so on, the ESB and people interested in the environment.</P>
    <P>There is a serious question mark over the quality of the water in the River Shannon, which has been heavily polluted. It appears that nothing is being done about this very important matter, to which the Minister should attend.</P>
    <P>The statutory authority which I envisage would be able to take action to help prevent the annual flooding of thousands of acres and the homes of many people living on the banks of the Shannon. It would also help ensure farmers would not have to undergo loss of fodder, crops and grazing lands.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was debated in the Seanad it passed through four Stages, receiving commendable and deserved publicity and the full support of every Fianna Fáil and PD Senator. Senator after Senator claimed credit for helping to set up the Shannon authority. However, in a bizarre and cynical manoeuvre, every one of those Senators voted against the Bill they had so vocally and, as we can now see, hypocritically supported.</P>

      <P>I speak here on behalf of farmers, householders and the community in general who have experienced flooding for years. We believe the establishment of a Shannon river authority is vital because only such a strong and powerful body will be able to take the actions necessary to alleviate our problems. The Government must be sensitive to the needs and difficulties of the farmers, householders and communities who are the victims of this annual flooding. I call on the Government not to ignore the ongoing and recurring flooding problems on the Shannon. The Minister of State said in the Seanad that he had powers to deal with flooding under existing legislation. If he has, he should use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Connaughton on bringing this issue before the House. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, back to the House. He abdicated his responsibility as soon as he stood up last night. The opening paragraph of his speech stated:</P>
      <P>I am here this evening because of the general responsibility of the Office of Public Works in relation to arterial drainage and flood relief issues. However, I want to make it clear at the outset that the Office of Public Works does not have any specific responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such an opening is an indication to me and every Member of the House that we are not about to see any progress on this issue. The Minister is now saying the solution is not to push this to a vote but to leave it to the select committee to make decisions on it. That is another cop out. We <Col N="866" /> have been listening to this mode of thinking for too long, while there has not been any action. Not one Minister of any Government has taken on these agencies, knocked their heads together and told them that this must be solved.</P>
    <P>We want a simple solution to this, where a Minister will take responsibility for one overall agency, with representatives of the other agencies, and tell them what to do, rather than requesting them to do it. Many times in the past, agencies such as the ESB refused to release one bucket of water down the Shannon until they saw bales of hay and livestock floating down the river or people marooned in their houses. That cannot continue. It is in the interests of the Minister and everybody else for that to stop. The only way to do that is to set up a council for which one Minister will be responsible, as suggested by Deputy Connaughton.</P>
    <P>I will give an instance which occurred near where I live to illustrate what is happening. In September 1997 a group of farmers lost their silage and hay in the callows of the Meelick-Eyrecourt area. I am sure that also happened on the Offaly border on the other side of the Shannon. As a result, they came to Ballinasloe to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, who promised them compensation. They have neither heard from him or seen him since. That group of farmers, in co-operation with a conservation group, had voluntarily decided to postpone their harvest to preserve the corncrake. That commitment has not been honoured. It is time this stopped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Connaughton on his initiative in tabling this proposal to establish an authority to oversee, co-ordinate and develop the Shannon, which is one of our greatest resources. I will dwell specifically on the estuary, which is totally underdeveloped.</P>
      <P>A report published in February 1994 by the Shannon estuary project team gave detailed proposals for a development programme between 1994 and 1999. This was a very high powered team, comprising the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Taoiseach, Foynes Harbour trustees, the Industrial Development Authority, Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the University of Limerick and Shannon Development, and was initiated by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. This report gave comprehensive proposals on how to develop the Shannon Estuary, but action has been taken on few of them. The report stated that the Shannon Estuary should be exploited to the fullest and referred to the cost free advantage given by the national deep water of the estuary. No other port in Europe has national deep water available for industrial maritime use at minimal capital outlay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain things which should happen to develop the estuary. Foynes, one of the four biggest ports, is by far the best port in the west <Col N="867" /> but it is in need of urgent development. I appreciate that the Minister has recently received a report which recommended a single estuarial authority, but I want to point out that acceptance of a single estuarial authority by Foynes is on foot of a clear understanding that there will be substantial development for Foynes of up to £40 million. This investment is required. It will have a consequential return and will enhance the area.</P>
    <P>At Askeaton, there is a 200 acre developed industrial site which nobody is touching. They will not touch it because there is no proper access. The N69, which services Foynes, Askeaton and areas of future development, is one of our worse national roads. This is restricting development. Industrialists arrive in Shannon Airport, which is a first class airport, and their cars are stuck behind trucks as they travel along the shore of the estuary to Foynes and Askeaton to see these places. That should not be tolerated. Therefore, if the Government wants to develop either Foynes or Askeaton, the N69 must be taken care of. I know there is mention of it in the recently published national development plan, but the issue should be addressed urgently. In that regard, the project recommended that one should be able to travel along the southern or northern shore of the estuary in one hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, at which the IFA and the ICMSA voiced their concerns following the recent flooding of the River Shannon were articulated. It was quite an emotional occasion, but I was disappointed that none of the different organisations was taking responsibility. The Office of Public Works stated that it had no responsibility for the River Shannon. Dúchas, which stated that it had responsibility for certain things, and the ESB seemed to be at cross purposes. The motion is timely because it is time an authority was put in place where somebody will take overall responsibility for the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>Every time there is flooding we focus our attention on it. It is a temporary type of concern. Ministers go into the area and accompany farmers on the backs of trailers, etc. It is probably a good television spectacle, but what action follows? The people were never compensated for the flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the long-term the Government must take serious action on the River Shannon. The Shannon has been described as the jewel of the western world. Deputy Daly, who lives on the other side of the river, appreciates the potential of the estuary. He has seen at first hand the success of the marina at Kilrush. My disappointment is that there is a necklace of marinas required along estuary. There should be more funding provided for the development of the marina at Foynes. I appreciate the assistance given recently for dredging operations there. I would hope that as the role of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has been extended, it will have <Col N="868" /> a function in providing grants for marinas which are required along the estuary. Talk of merging the Foynes and Limerick harbour bodies into one estuarial authority is for another day, but the considerable potential of the estuary in the future must be harnessed. Deputy Neville is correct. As spokesperson on the Marine and Natural Resources for my party, I would be conscious that whatever emerges at the end of the day will be good for the people of Foynes who we represent. I will be watching closely what emerges there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The River Shannon is long and there are many constituency interests involved. I come from the constituency where the River Shannon meets the sea because the estuary is tidal. While there are problems in the estuarial part of the River Shannon, they are not to do with flooding. However, from the upper River Shannon to the Curragh Gower Falls in Limerick, there is a difficulty. Heavy rain causes flooding in my constituency at Shannon Banks, Corbally in County Clare, Athluncard Street and Sir Harry's Mall in the old parish on the island in the centre of the river in Limerick which is bounded by the River Shannon on one side and the Abbey River on the other. On Christmas Eve there was a huge flood there and about 25 homes were flooded. Since then, we have been urging the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, and his senior colleague to come to the assistance of the householders whose artefacts and furnishings were destroyed by the flood. In Athluncard Street and along Sir Harry's Mall there is an area which has flooded for centuries.</P>
      <P>The difference between what happened on Christmas Eve and what happened before is it was worse this time than it has been at any time in living memory. It is not possible to insure houses there against flooding because it is an area subject to flooding. The water came in to a height of three feet. It destroyed carpets and furnishing and there is no way of claiming because there is no possibility of getting insurance cover. It was so bad this time that it went over the bridge out to the main Corbally road and, in effect, people on that side of the city were cut-off at Christmas from getting into the city.</P>
      <P>In addition, although the River Shannon did not breach its bank, it went over its banks further upstream and flowed into the housing estates on the Clare side of the river in that part of suburban Limerick which spills into Clare. At the lower end, along by the river again, a number of houses were flooded and, indeed, cars parked in driveways outside houses were flooded also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State will be aware that I previously raised this on the Adjournment. He also knows that his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, led a delegation on which I was <Col N="869" /> represented to meet the Minister for Finance. The demands are two-fold. First we want money to ensure that this does not recur. There is a main drainage scheme going into Limerick now and in that context we want remedial works carried out. In addition, we want compensation for the people who cannot get insurance for their houses. We want a fund set up. Compensation was provided in the case of the River Dodder in Ballsbridge, and at Clonmel in east Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>My father used tell me that at every election from the time of de Valera and Lemass and on to Haughey, the two big items in the west were a statutory authority for the River Shannon and a biscuit factory for Mayo. Neither was ever established. Neither the biscuit factory nor the authority ever materialised. Fianna Fáil was always great. It promised the sun, the moon and the stars. As Mr. Gerry L'Estrange said one time, with Fianna Fáil you would hear the bees but you would never see the honey.</P>
      <P>That is the way it is with the River Shannon authority. The people of the River Shannon in the midlands, in Longford and Roscommon, have suffered from flooding since the foundation of the State. Last Christmas I was travelling from Mayo to a funeral in Mullingar and I nearly destroyed my car when I arrived at Longford. There was nobody in attendance from the county council to tell people that there was a flood across the road. Many people were stranded and we had to go back and take a detour to get to Dublin. It is a disgrace. We have talked about this and we know the action which must be taken, but nobody has done anything about it. All the statutory agencies, including the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, have done nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give credit where it is due. When my party was in Government, Deputy McCormack and the late Deputy Hugh Coveney, who was then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, got agreement among the farmers and a few machine men in Galway, and they did a job which cost a couple of hundred thousand pounds. The departmental officials did everything in their power to stop us from getting them the money. We had to have a special parliamentary party meeting to put pressure on the then Taoiseach and Government to make sure that money was paid to those people. Since then, there has never been a problem. Why do we not listen to the farmers and the householders? They will tell us how to resolve this problem. They will tell us what has to be done. Money must be put in place and there must be somebody to take responsibility and give leadership. The people of Longford, Offaly and Roscommon have had enough. We heard how last Christmas people's houses and lands were flooded. People are entitled to be able to get in and out of their homes and to farm their land. Next Christmas they should be assured that their homes will not be flooded and the fire brig<Col N="870" /> ade or neighbours will not have to rescue them. It is time we had action, that the agency was put in place and responsibility was given to somebody. We have talked and heard enough about it and enough elections have been fought on this issue. We now want money and action to ensure the work is done so that once and for all people from the midlands and the west will not have to get boats to and from their farms and houses as happened in recent years. When everybody in Dublin was firing thousands of pounds in the air, the people from the west could not get to or from their homes. Enough is enough, we want the Minister to take responsibility and the Government to commit itself to an authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in their plea to the Government to provide for a Shannon authority. As my colleagues have outlined, there is a necessity to have a group which will take responsibility for the river. As Deputy Noonan outlined, the tributary of the River Fergus also joins the Shannon. Last year we again had flooding of houses and because farmers and others are building around Ennis we suffered additional flooding.</P>
      <P>The previous Government provided compensation in kind to those who suffered the trauma of flooding, but unfortunately nothing has been paid this time and nobody has received relief, something I very much regret.</P>
      <P>There should be a body with authority from Loop Head to the top of the River Shannon. There should be some way of raising funds for the entire Shannon in order to carry out the developments which have been spoken about. As far as I am concerned I have no beef with the Limerick harbour commissioners. An authority can be put in place to raise enough funds to subsidise developments in the upper Shannon. Everybody knows that Lough Derg has been contaminated through the outflows into the Shannon upstream. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, as Minister for the Environment promised he would eliminate some of the bigger sources of pollution in Lough Derg, two of which were identified as the sewerage schemes in Nenagh and Scarriff. Yet, there has not been any work on the sewerage scheme in Scarriff and I wonder if the Minister of State will ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the reason for this delay. Can some urgent corrective action be taken?</P>
      <P>An authority with control from County Leitrim to Loop Head and with its own resources would be very successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everybody for their contributions over the past two nights. It was an important debate and I pay tribute to the number of people who have shown an interest from all over the country and who have been in the public gallery tonight and last night. There are more people in the gallery than I have seen for any debate in a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> I am somewhat confused by what has happened. On behalf of Fine Gael I tabled a very sensible and simple motion asking the Government to establish a statutory authority on the River Shannon. It could not be simpler. Last night we went through all the things the authority was likely to do or should do and I do not have time to go back over them. I could not understand what the Government was doing when it tabled an amendment to my motion as it seems to be saying we might want a statutory authority in the future but we do not want one tonight. The amendment refers the matter to the Committee of Public Enterprise and Transport. I have no problem with the committee considering the issue, but this further delays the entire matter.</P>
    <P>I was in Athlone on that famous Sunday when the IFA organised one of the biggest meetings I have ever seen in the aftermath of the huge flooding. Speaker after speaker said they wanted a Shannon statutory authority for the reasons Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the Opposition have put forward. We know there has to be a responsible body with a co-ordinating role. Without that the other agencies will not be whipped into line &ndash; it is that simple. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, gave an undertaking, admittedly on a personal basis, that she believed it was a good idea. Everybody else also thought it was a good idea that night.</P>
    <P>This was followed by the introduction of Deputy Daly's Bill. I know the Deputy has a great personal interest in the matter and he went to the trouble of formulating a Bill which was taken on Second, Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad just two months ago. It was considered over three or four weeks in the Seanad, with all Members saying it was a great Bill. However, there was then a message from the top saying it was to be voted against on Report Stage and the Bill was thrown out. What sort of democracy is this? Who is codding whom?</P>
    <P>The most important meeting ever held about the future of the Shannon took place last January <Col N="872" /> at a sitting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Public Enterprise and Transport. Every Deputy and Senator from every side of the House said on that occasion that they wanted a statutory authority. I asked the ESB, the Office of Public Works and Dúchas whether they were willing to work within the context of an overall statutory authority for the Shannon and they said they were. I cannot understand why the Cabinet did not mandate the Minister, whom I believe has the will power to deliver, to say to the House last night that the Government believes in a statutory authority for the Shannon but that there is much work to be done before getting to that stage. However, rather than doing that the Government is voting down this motion on the understanding that it will be referred to a committee and we must wait to see the outcome. Why did the Minister not declare his interest in principle?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has been isolated by virtue of the fact that this concerns the Office of Public Works. I would like to have seen several senior Ministers in the House during the debate. The Ministers for the Environment and Local Government, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Tourism, Sport and Recreation should have had a huge input.</P>
    <P>The Shannon authority appears to be a very low priority for the Government. I have no problem with the matter being discussed by the committee, but I want the Minister, and in particular the Independents, those four great people who say they are keeping up the trousers of the Government, to vote for the motion if they genuinely believe the Government is wrong not to establish a statutory authority to help those people who have been damned by flood waters over the years. Now is the time to do it. The wrong signals are going out to everybody, particularly those involved in the competing interest groups around the Shannon. The Government is not behind a Shannon authority and it is against that background I hope we win the vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>The anomaly in the application for remission of VRT and VAT under the disabled drivers and passengers tax concession regulations is very serious. It is difficult to advise a son who is helping his mother who has lost a leg, a husband looking after his wife who has a serious injury, a disabled son looking after both his disabled parents or a young girl who cannot use her <Col N="875" /> legs as a result of an accident that they cannot get relief.</P>
      <P>The first case I will mention tonight is that of a son living on the same grounds as his mother. I will read his appeal:</P>
      <P>I am the only member of the family able to bring my mother to Rehab in Dún Laoghaire for her check ups and must take days off work for same. My brother, who sometimes stays with my mother, is involved in the construction industry. He owns a van which is not suitable for my mother to climb into.</P>
      <P>My house was built 11 years ago and my mother's leg was only amputated four years ago. When she came home from hospital she stayed in my house for some time but she was nervous when the children were around. She returned later to her own house where she felt more comfortable.</P>
      <P>There is approximately 35 feet between the two houses, with an entrance at the rear and full view from both houses. As I am married with a wife and two children, I only stay in my mother's house when my brother is not at home.</P>
      <P>I take my mother for check ups, to the doctor, shopping, etc., and I am also responsible for getting her medication and anything else she may require.</P>
      <P>Each morning before going to work I go over to my mother's house and have my breakfast with her. My wife comes home each day at lunch time and has her lunch with my mother. Each evening when I come home from work I go over and have my evening meal with her. My wife collects my mother's pension each Friday and gets any messages my mother may need. I have put a swivel passenger seat in the car because my mother finds it very hard to get in and out of the car. I also put a lift in the boot to lift the wheelchair, which is quite heavy. On one occasion I injured my back while trying to get the wheelchair into the last car. It was only when I was changing my car that I was advised to apply for the disabled passengers' scheme.</P>
      <P>His appeal was refused on the grounds that the residence requirement was not met. The family reorganised the mother's bungalow with ramps at their own expense. A house extension could have been built which would have been granted aided to the sum of £12,000. I ask that this case be looked at again and that the money which has been paid to the Revenue by this man be paid back. How can I, or the Minister, explain to the family why the regulations are so inflexible when they see millions of pounds being paid out? Only today we saw a person getting a handout of £48,000 and others getting a lot of money. Is it easy to explain how a handicapped person can be refused money on a technicality when others can get money for doing nothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second case is that of an aged wife who has the use of only one leg. The other was badly <Col N="876" /> damaged and she is not able to travel to Dublin for reassessment. A request to send a reassessment from Dublin was refused. The man in question has been refused the benefit to which he is entitled. The third case is that of a disabled son who is looking after both his parents who are also disabled. He does not meet the tight criteria, that is, having lost a leg or an arm, laid down by the Department. I am disturbed the Minister has no interest in people with the types of disability I have mentioned, although he can read the record. This is an extremely serious matter.</P>
    <P>The last case involves a young girl who was involved in an accident. She is living in a rural area, does not have full use of her legs and cannot stand without aid. She has been refused access to the scheme and is being sent for reassessment. Given the billion pound surplus in the first three months of this year, those with disabilities and who need a means of transport should be considered. I know a committee has been set but it is important justice is done for those who need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I set out again for the information of the House the background to the disabled drivers' and the disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme. Section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, introduced an exemption from road tax for vehicles adapted or constructed for and used by disabled persons who, in the main, would have been confined to wheelchairs. The scheme was later extended to allow relief from VAT and from vehicle registration tax. A qualifying person is also allowed relief from the payment of excise duty on road fuel. To qualify for benefit under the scheme, a disabled person had to be certified by the senior area medical officer in his or her health board area as to be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his (her) legs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A framework for a new consolidated scheme of relief was provided for under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989. The regulations made under that Act set out criteria for eligibility for the reliefs as well as specifying their scope and various procedures to be complied with in order to qualify for benefit. The resultant Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, came into operation on 21 December 1989.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions set out in the 1989 scheme was carried out in 1993 and resulted in the adoption of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. Six different types of disability are listed under these regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. For the information of Deputies, a copy of the regulations is available in the Library. These 1994 regulations were drawn up following wide ranging consultation with the Departments of Health, Environment and Justice, the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, Opposition spokespersons for Finance and organisations dealing with the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> As has been said in reply to numerous parliamentary questions on the matter, the scheme targets what are very generous tax reliefs at those persons who are severely and permanently handicapped with regard to physical mobility. If a person is refused the necessary medical certificate by the senior area medical officer, that decision may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. I must confirm to the House that there is only one board of appeal and this board hears all the appeal cases no matter what health board the person is residing in. This ensures consistency in the operation of the appeals process.</P>
    <P>The principal issue of concern expressed in connection with the reliefs in 1994, today and by Deputy Crawford, relates to their scope. Arguably, the pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its substantial benefit in terms of the tax relief available. Each person who is suffering from some disability or illness and who applies for the benefits believes that his or her case is unique and deserving of admittance into the scheme. I am sure that the House will appreciate that the scheme cannot be extended to all and every person who suffers from some form of disablement or disability &ndash; however deserving each person or group considers their case to be.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance is on record as saying in this House and as I have said myself in a previous debate, it is appreciated that persons who suffer from disability face certain difficulty in coping with everyday life. However, the costs involved in this scheme are considerable. For example, the total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 5,400. On average the scheme is worth up to £800 per year from the refund of petrol excise, £7,500 relief on the price of a new car every two years and also gives exemption from road tax. The cost of relief in 1999 was £17 million compared to £4 million in 1994, which shows how this scheme is being sought out and used.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the interdepartmental review group, under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is currently examining the scheme to see what amendments or modifications may be made to it. I am happy to tell the House I understand that the review group had a meeting this afternoon and is proposing to meet with representatives of a number of organisations and with a number of persons who indicated a desire to make oral submissions. I understand that the dates for such oral presentations are being finalised and the meetings will take place early in May in a Dublin hotel. I invite all Deputies who have raised this matter in the House to make submissions to that group, care of the Secretary to the Group on the Review of the Disabled Drivers' Scheme, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mespil Road, Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>The information furnished at the meetings and through the submissions will facilitate the group <Col N="878" /> in bringing its work to an early conclusion and in finalising its report for consideration. I look forward to an early receipt of the report. I thank Deputy Crawford for giving me the opportunity to update both him and the House on the speedy movement forward which was doubted on the previous occasion when I responded to such a debate. We are now making progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter. I also thank the Minister for being present to respond to the need for the Minister for Education and Science to intervene, as a matter of urgency, so that children attending Drim national school, Loughrea, County Galway, who have been withdrawn from instruction, can resume their attendance at school and that the parents of these children can have full confidence in the quality of education provided for the infants and junior section of this school. I ask the Minister to consult with all interested parties in this serious situation so that the matter can be resolved satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>It was with great reluctance that I brought this matter to the Minister's attention. The children have been out of class for one week. The main problem is that there is no forum whereby the interested parties can be brought together. For that reason it is essential that the Minister act immediately. The board of management has been suspended or displaced. The parents' representative group has also disbanded. The parents of the children involved are frustrated because their children are without instruction, which is very serious. There is no forum at which the point at issue can be resolved unless there is consultation.</P>
      <P>The parents did not take their decision lightly. They have shown their commitment to the school in that since last September they have raised £9,000 to contribute towards the refurbishment and extension of that small national rural school. A serious problem lies ahead. If parents who are currently trying to decide which school to send their children to lose confidence in this school, that will lead eventually to its closure.</P>
      <P>The schools are closing tomorrow for the Easter holidays. This should give a breathing space to the Department to move with urgency to bring the parties together and resolve the situation in a rational way. None of the parties want to prolong the difficulty because it is the children who will lose and that cannot be allowed to happen. The onus is on the Minister to activate a strong Departmental team to quickly call together the representatives of all the interested groups, and there are many. I understand fully the complexity of such negotiations. However, it is in the interests of everybody, and particularly the children, that that be done quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no desire on the part of the parents to engage in a witch hunt or gain a victory. Victory is not on the agenda in this instance. It is in <Col N="879" /> nobody's interests that anybody should be able to say they won or that somebody else lost or was faced down. What is important is that there is no forum and nobody who will take the lead. That is why it is imperative that the Department should take the lead. The Department has a direct involvement and a responsibility to deliver and provide for the education of young children.</P>
    <P>What I want from the Minister this evening is a commitment to bring together the people who are directly involved, at a time and place suitable to all parties, and to resolve this serious situation.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Deputy and to clarify the situation pertaining to this school, which is a two-teacher primary school with 27 pupils enrolled in the current year.</P>

      <P>In the event that he so wishes, the patron may manage the school himself or may nominate a suitable person to act as a manager. The patron recently appointed the chairperson of the board as manager of the school.</P>
      <P>I understand that a teacher in the school was absent on sick leave for a period and that a certificate of fitness to resume duty was submitted by the teacher. The board specified certain conditions which the person had to agree to prior to resuming duty. The teacher in question accepted these conditions and resumed duty on 13 April, 2000. The patron of the diocese, the manager of the school and the Department of Education and Science inspector have been involved in discussions to resolve the situation.</P>
      <P>The inspector also consulted the teacher concerned earlier this week to obtain her observations. A representative of the parents whose children are not currently attending the school was also in contact with the inspector and the issues involved in the case were discussed.</P>
      <P>The officials in the Department of Education and Science are available to assist everyone involved in this serious situation in finding a resolution as soon as possible. I agree with the Deputy that this is a very serious situation and the Minister for Education and Science is most anxious that the difficulty be resolved as a matter of urgency. I am sure the patron and manager of the school share my concern on this.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Department of Education and Science are prepared to meet the parents of the children absent from school immediately after Easter to discuss the issues involved. The officials will continue to liaise with the manager and the parents to assist them in resolving the situation in so far as it is possible.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Primary School.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> Mr. McDowell: This first came to my attention when I was canvassing during the local elections last year when a constituent mentioned that the reception year in St. Joseph's co-educational national school in East Wall had been effectively terminated or, at the very least, that instructions had been received from the Department of Education and Science that the reception year should be terminated.</P>
    <P>I had not previously heard of a reception year or a facility to introduce a reception year in national schools. I took the trouble to investigate it further and I was both interested and excited by what I found. Since roughly 1984 this relatively small co-educational primary school in East Wall has been operating in effect a three-year infant cycle. It receives children who in the first year go through what one might call pre-learning. They do not use text books but they are facilitated in learning the use of language, in learning to write and in learning what is called pre-mathematics which is essentially basic numeracy. The year is run in the most informal way possible to foster links between the parents and the school and the teachers involved. It is not pre-school in the sense that it is done within the confines and within the structure of the school, and it is not a crèche, for the same reason. It has to be said that this is what we would normally refer to as a disadvantaged area where pre-school facilities and crèches which might be available in better off areas are simply not available. The reception year was clearly meeting a need.</P>
    <P>Since then the facility being provided has been assessed, most recently some ten years ago by the centre in Drumcondra who concluded that the senior infants in the school had benefited from and were continuing to benefit from the fact that there was a reception year in place. Given that it is some 15 years since the year was instituted it is now possible to say, with some empirical evidence, that pupils have benefited in their later education from having been able to avail of the reception year.</P>
    <P>When I became aware of this I tabled a question to the Minister for Education and Science to which I received a two-sided response. On the one hand I was told the curriculum was intended to be flexible, child-centred and capable of being adapted to cater for the individual needs of pupils. On the other hand I was told that a three-year cycle was utterly unacceptable because it did not conform to the rules.</P>
    <P>As somebody who does not claim any great expertise in matters of education, it seems to me that there must be huge benefits in allowing certain flexibility to individual schools in areas of need which have pupils with particular needs, to adapt the curriculum. If they can do that by having an additional reception year or, for that matter, a mid-infant cycle year, that is altogether a good thing. Far from closing down or instructing a school that it must close down the reception <Col N="881" /> year, we should compliment schools which have taken an initiative that can be clearly shown to have had positive results for the children concerned. That, unfortunately, is not what is happening. What we have here is essentially a bureaucratic response. What we have is, regrettably, a Civil Service and civil servants simply saying that this does not conform to the rules and must, therefore, be terminated because it might give the wrong idea to other people.</P>
    <P>The evidence suggests that the reception year is a good idea. If the Minister doubts that I invite him to make a further evaluation of the reception year, which I am sure the school would welcome, and take a decision based on that. From what little I know of it, far from closing it down we should be encouraging it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Deputy on the staffing position in St. Joseph's co-ed primary school and the retention of the three year infant cycle. I realise that the issue of the reception year, not just in this school but generally, is of concern to a number of Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September the previous year. The enrolment of St. Joseph's co-ed primary school on 30 September 1998 was 250 pupils. The enrolment on 30 September 1999 decreased to 234 pupils. The school has a staffing of principal, nine mainstream class teachers, one remedial teacher, a shared home school liaison teacher and a special disadvantaged concessionary post in the current school year.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to outline the position with regard to the reception year. I understand St. Joseph's has operated a reception year in the school for a number of years. The primary curriculum is designed as an eight year course and there is no official programme for a reception class within that curriculum. The policy of the Department of Education and Science is, and has been, that children who are over four years of age should be enrolled at the beginning of the school year and commence in junior infants. I am aware that there is a tradition in many schools whereby pupils are enrolled for a number of days prior to the summer vacation to facilitate them in adjusting to school life.</P>
      <P>After spending a year in junior infants, pupils should progress to senior infants and spend two years overall in the infant cycle. As a general rule, pupils should progress from one standard to a higher standard at the end of each year. I understand that in St. Joseph's children are routinely enrolled from 1 September onwards for a number of months in a reception class and are promoted to junior infants from 1 September of the following year and spend a further two years in the infant cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phasing out of the reception year was discussed by personnel of the Department of Education and Science with the staff of the school and <Col N="882" /> the chairperson during the 1998-99 school year. The board of management was subsequently advised by letter, in June 1999, that a two year infant cycle should be re-established for the 1999-2000 school year. I would also point out to the Deputy that St. Joseph's is not the only school where a reception year or a three year infant cycle is being phased out. I can think of one or two in my own constituency. It is the policy of the Department of Education and Science when it becomes aware of the existence of a reception year or three year cycle to inform the school to cease the practice.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government announced its intention to deliver a £194 million three year multi-sectoral programme addressing educational disadvantage. The allocation for the primary sector over the period of this programme will be in excess of £25 million and will target children and young people who are most at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system. A comprehensive survey of all primary schools will be carried out on the Minister's behalf by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, during the current school term. The purpose of the survey will be to identify the level of concentration in each school of children at risk of educational disadvantage. The results will be used to determine the tiers of support that will be provided in September 2000 for the schools with above average concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Consequently, it is of vital importance that all schools, including St. Joseph's, should complete the questionnaire that they will receive and return it within the stipulated time. The level of resources allocated under the new three year programme will reflect the numbers of pupils in each school with &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; characteristics.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter. Courtenay boys' primary school, Newcastle West, has 193 pupils on its roll. It has 11 teachers and a teaching principal. Along with its eight mainstream classes it has three special classes, a resource teacher and a remedial teacher. From 2 May it will also have a class for those with a specific speech and language disorder. The teaching principal of the school, Bega Ryan, does an excellent job. Together with coping as a remedial teacher she is involved in a multiplicity of other duties as principal. She is coping with a situation where, because of the social mix in the school, she is preparing pupils <Col N="883" /> for the top post-primary schools and also has to liaise with school attendance officers.</P>
      <P>Recently I was approached by a group of teachers from the school who are concerned because of the excessive demands on the teaching principal. They felt I should raise the matter in the House. They outlined their frustration that the Department did not recognise the unique position that prevails in the school and the pressures their teaching principal was under. They stated she deserved to be a full-time administrative principal because of the demands of the job. The day for this principal usually begins at 8.30 a.m. and ends at 6 p.m. She must also attend school related night meetings. I am aware the INTO discussed this matter with the Department of Education and Science and feel there is justification in Bega Ryan being appointed as a full-time administrative principal.</P>
      <P>I am aware there is one other school where a similar position exists. On 11 November 1998, because of the frustration of all concerned, the teachers with the backup of parents, picketed the school in Newcastle West. This is surely symptomatic of the frustration of all concerned at the inactivity of the Department of Education and Science in not recognising that the teaching principal should be a full time administrative principal of the school.</P>
      <P>I implore the Minister to bring this unjust saga to an end by recognising the uniqueness and justification of the case and to confirm that the principal will be a full-time administrative principal. It is time to end the intolerable and unfair burden on this principal. I look forward to a favourable response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Deputy on the appointment of an administrative principal at Courtenay national school. The Deputy is no doubt aware that the staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September in the previous year. The enrolment of Courtenay national school on 30 September 1999 was 192 pupils, including pupils being taught in special classes for Travellers. I understand that the school has a staffing of principal, six main<Col N="884" /> stream class teachers, one remedial teacher and five special class teachers in the current school year.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to outline the position with regard to the appointment of administrative principals in primary schools. In the current school year, administrative principals are appointed to ordinary primary schools with eight mainstream class teachers. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, for the 2000-01 school year, the Minister for Education and Science has approved the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary primary schools with principal plus seven mainstream class teachers. He recently gave a commitment to deliver the most comprehensive and concentrated package of supports ever to primary school principals over the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These supports include the release from full-time teaching duties of principals with six mainstream class teachers, the approval of release time for principals of smaller schools to attend to non-teaching duties and enhanced secretarial and caretaking services for schools.</P>
      <P>This package is further evidence of the Government's commitment to primary education and to the appreciation of the role of our primary school principals. The Minister is aware that there is a number of schools, including the one referred to by Deputy Finucane, where there are a number of <i>ex quota</i> posts for special classes and where there are fewer than seven mainstream class teachers. He is examining, in the context of the distribution of the teaching posts arising from the allocation of the demographic dividend this year, the possibility of the appointment of administrative principals to primary schools with a large number of <i>ex quota</i> teaching posts. The case of Courtenay national school is being considered in that context and the Department of Education and Science will advise the board of management of the position in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am aware of Deputy Finucane's strong interest in this case. He has made a compelling case and I assure him that I will use my best endeavours to ensure a successful outcome.</P>

      <P>As I said in my answer to Question No. 12 of 28 March 2000, at the meeting of the Ireland-America economic advisory board we had a detailed discussion on developments in the Irish economy. This included presentations on e-commerce developments in Ireland and the related MediaLab Europe initiative. This project, which will be developed in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is expected to contribute to improving Ireland's e-commerce capability, primarily by increasing research and development activity in this area.  The members of the advisory board seemed to feel that this was an important and worthwhile initiative. I did not promise to undertake any actions relating to this project on my return to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last August, I accepted an invitation from the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to attend the United Nations millennium summit which is currently set to take place in New York on September 6-8 next. In my letter accepting <Col N="886" /> Secretary-General Annan's invitation, I indicated my hope that the outcome of the summit might be a serious and realistic programme to renew, revitalise and strengthen the UN for a new era.</P>
    <P>On 15 March 2000, the General Assembly decided that the summit's overall theme will be &ldquo;The Role of the United Nations in the Twenty-First Century&rdquo;. It also decided that the summit will be composed of plenary meetings and of four interactive round-table sessions. The themes for discussion at the round-table sessions have yet to be decided by the member states in New York. They will form the agenda for our discussions at the summit.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General presented his report for the millennium summit to the General Assembly on Monday 3 April. The report entitled &ldquo;We the Peoples: the Role of the United Nations in the 21 Century&rdquo; is intended to facilitate preparations by member states for the forthcoming millennium summit. It identifies some of the pressing challenges faced by the world's population and proposes a number of immediate priorities for consideration at the summit itself. Heads of state or government are urged to take action in areas such as poverty, water, debt relief, education, HIV-AIDS, slum clearance, youth employment and information technology. The Secretary-General also urges the summit to make special provision for the needs of Africa, and to fully support Africans in their struggle to overcome the continent's problems. In addition, the Secretary-General calls for a renewed focus on conflict prevention and disarmament and on respect for international law. The adoption of a new ethic of conservation and stewardship of the environment is also identified as a priority. In my view, the report offers a broad and challenging agenda for consideration in the lead-up to, and during the summit. The Government will work to ensure the success of the summit.</P>
    <P>On 6 April, I wrote to the new Japanese Prime Minister, Mr. Yoshiro Mori, congratulating him on his appointment and wishing him well for the future. I also took the opportunity to express, both to Prime Minister Mori and to Mrs Obuchi, the sympathy of the Irish people for Mr. Obuchi's illness and our hopes for his recovery. I have also written to the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Simitis, congratulating him on his re-election on 9 April.</P>
    <P>I was very happy to welcome former President Nelson Mandela to Government Buildings on 12 April during his private visit to Ireland. We had a very interesting meeting. I enjoyed once again hearing his views, arising from extensive experience, on conflict resolution. In particular, we discussed the peace process and he emphasised the need for generosity on all sides in order to achieve progress. I thanked him for the help which South Africa has given in relation to the peace process. We discussed developments in South Africa, and spoke about my visit there earlier this year. I mentioned the trade delegation which accompanied me and we spoke briefly about trade matters. We spoke about the recent <Col N="887" /> Africa-Europe summit and Mr. Mandela briefed me on the progress of his work as facilitator of the Burundi peace negotiations. He thanked me for Ireland's support for South African reconstruction and development and asked that Ireland continue its commitment to development, not just in South Africa but also in other parts of the African continent.</P>
    <P>Later today, I will meet Mr Li Lanqing, Vice-Premier of China. The Vice-Premier has particular responsibility for trade, investment and education and he is in Ireland as the guest of the Tánaiste. No formal agenda has been set for his meeting with me, but I expect to discuss points of mutual interest, including the development of Ireland's Asia strategy and other aspects of bilateral economic relations, as well as international developments of note including preparations for the forthcoming ASEM III summit in Korea and the ASEM Young Leaders' Forum which Ireland will host this June.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My keynote address to the annual conference of the Irish Management Institute on 7 April was focused on the main challenges facing the Irish economy and society in the years ahead &ndash; princi<Col N="888" /> pally globalisation, EU enlargement and rapid technological change.</P>
    <P>In particular, I emphasised the need to invest heavily so as to position Ireland to become a world-class leader in the global, knowledge-based, digital economy; to build on that through the pursuit of top-class policies on connectivity, education, regulation and partnership; and, to deliver, through social partnership, the potential inherent in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. That will require all sides to adhere to both the letter and spirit of the programme.</P>
    <P>Through the provisions set out in the Government's own programme, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the National Development Plan, we are well positioned to ensure the long-term sustainability of economic and social progress. I made the point in my address, however, that the enormous potential of these highly ambitious programmes can only be realised fully if we maintain the level of discipline which has served us so well in the past.</P>
    <P>I went into considerable detail on the main challenges facing Irish society in my address, which is available in the Oireachtas Library for further reference.</P>
    <P>On the issue of widening representation in the social partnership process, I indicated in the House last week that the spirit within which the four pillars have operated over recent years suggests the desirability that any organisation wishing to become part of the process should secure the agreement of the appropriate social partner pillar. In the event of a positive response, the Government would consider such applications sympathetically, taking due account of such factors as continuance of a fair balance in representation as between the four pillars.</P>
    <P>Regarding the inclusion of the organisations specified in the questions, it is my understanding that none of them have yet sought formal agreement for inclusion under the appropriate pillar. With regard to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, obviously only those organisations involved in its negotiation will be involved in its implementation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet committee on infrastructure is an integral part of Government and its meetings, as with any Cabinet committee, are an integral part of the business of Government. The practice has grown up over time of allowing questions in the House as to the date and number of meetings of <Col N="889" /> such committees. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>

      <P>Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is an important element of the revised primary curriculum. Through this programme children develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their decisions and actions both now and in the future. SPHE helps children to become more discerning in their use of the media and to learn about, and become aware of, the techniques and strategies used in advertising and in the media generally.</P>
      <P>A detailed section on media education is contained in the curriculum for each level from infants to sixth class. The material is graded in terms of difficulty to suit the needs of each age-group and there are specific elements on advertising at each level. Detailed guidelines are provided in the curriculum documentation on planning the media programme at school and classroom level. Exemplars on the pedagogic approaches that might be adopted in order to enable children to analyse a television advertisement are provided in the teacher guidelines.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this programme will result in raising the awareness of children to the influences of television and other forms of advertising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of school development planning is, by its nature, ongoing. Many schools at primary and second level have been engaged in school development planning for some time and are at various stages in the developmental process. A considerable number of schools have a plan in place or are in the process of refining-revising various elements of their plan. The Education Act, 1998, requires schools to have a school plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a strong tradition of school development in the primary sector for over 20 years, and experience of school evaluations indi<Col N="890" /> cates that the vast majority of schools have documented various aspects of curriculum and school policies as part of a school plan.</P>
    <P>My Department published comprehensive development planning guidelines for primary schools last summer in order to provide a uniform template for drawing up a school plan. These guidelines were developed in close consultation with the education partners and circulated to all primary schools.</P>
    <P>School Development Planning  &ndash; An Introduction for Second Level Schools was prepared by my Department, in consultation with the partners in education and circulated to all second level schools in September 1999. More detailed guidelines for second level schools will be issued by September 2001, following a development project being undertaken at present by 130 schools.</P>
    <P>At second level, three surveys have been carried out to determine the level of involvement of schools in school planning. In 1999 the Secondary School Principals Association surveyed its members in 430 schools. From a 44% response rate, 26% of schools had a school plan and a further 48% had commenced the process. The secretariat for secondary schools surveyed the same schools in January-February 2000. From a 65% response rate, 85% of schools were now engaged in school planning or had a school plan. The Association of Community Schools surveyed all 83 community and comprehensive schools recently and from a 63% response rate, 84% of schools were engaged in the school planning process or had a school plan. The Irish Vocational Education Association is about to survey vocational schools and community colleges under the aegis of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I have allocated £5 million as part of a school development planning initiative between 1999-2002 to assist schools in the school development planning process. It is hoped that, by the end of 2002, all schools will have embarked on the process, made good progress and very many will have a school plan in place. All schools serving disadvantaged areas at both primary and second level have been targeted for help initially as part of the school development planning initiative.</P>

      <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of providing education and care to young children in a seamless fashion. Seamlessness can only be achieved through a co-ordinated approach to early childhood services. A range of proposals to ensure co-ordination is set out in the White Paper. In addition, officials from my <Col N="891" /> Department are participating in inter-departmental structures established under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to ensure that early education policy is developed in harmony with policy on the broader child care issues.</P>
      <P>In developing the White Paper strategy, efforts will be made to ensure continuity and seamlessness in the progression of children from the home through pre-school and infants classes in primary schools and further in the education system. The development of curricula and methodologies will be undertaken with this objective in mind.</P>
      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper, including measures to ensure co-ordination and seamlessness, is currently under way in my Department. Key principles underpinning the White Paper are that implementation will be undertaken on a phased basis and that progress will be achieved through a process of consultation with interested parties.</P>
      <P>My officials are currently in discussion with parties involved in early childhood education with a view to implementing the White Paper proposals and establishing the necessary structures. This process will be concluded shortly.</P>

    <P>The formulation of outreach strategies to attract people who would stand to benefit from adult education programmes, particularly in the area of literacy and basic education, is encouraged in the Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning. The funding provided by my Department for adult education is increasing significantly in the context of the national development plan, and this will provide for further locations to be developed in the period ahead as the need arises. Implementation of national certification arrangements has also been progressed through the work of the National <Col N="892" /> Council for Vocational Awards, and this area will be further strengthened through the work of the National Qualifications Authority. This will provide for formal progression pathways through which participants can progress to higher education.</P>
    <P>With regard to third level provision, following the report of the steering committee on the future development on higher education in 1995, the Higher Education Authority was requested to conduct a review of outreach centres of higher education institutions. The Higher Education Authority appointed a technical working group, under the chairmanship of Professor Noel Mulcahy, to consider a range of issues regarding outreach centres. The Higher Education Authority will publish the technical working group's report this week. I have asked the authority to consider the recommendations in the report and advise me accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The recently published ESRI-Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment 1998 Annual School Leavers' Survey indicated that about 81% of students currently complete second level education. This figure is broadly in line with my Department's own analysis of data in this area, which indicate a completion rate of some 83% when account is taken of a range of factors such as inter-school transfer and emigration.</P>
      <P>Given the vital significance of school completion for the life chances of our young people, we must continue to press for improvement in the numbers completing second level. As the Deputy will be aware, this is a complex and difficult issue and one not amenable to quick fix or easy solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my view that the correct approach in dealing with this issue is to advance on a number of fronts. In the first instance we must ensure that <Col N="893" /> there is a proper legislative underpinning to school attendance. I see the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, as providing this. We must also ensure that the curriculum provided in our second level schools meets the needs of all pupils. The leaving certificate applied and the junior certificate schools programme are examples of measures which have made a real impact and we need to build further on these.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that we assist schools in a direct and focused manner in coping with the problem of early school leaving. The recent Stay in School initiative will make a real difference here. At the core of this initiative is the concept of schools devising their own plans and being assisted to implement these. This assistance is very much a reality both in terms of advice and, most importantly, additional resources.</P>
    <P>I do not want to understate the scale and complexity of this problem by setting absolute timescales for reaching particular levels of retention. In a buoyant economy the temptations for young people to leave school early inevitably increase and the challenge for Government is to offset this by considered and effective action.</P>

      <P>The discussions which have taken place with regard to road safety matters in the school syllabus have been between officers of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the National Safety Council. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is the body which advises me and my Department on <Col N="895" /> curriculum matters. The National Safety Council is a body established, under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971, and supported by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the consultations, to date, have been concerned with the production, by the National Safety Council, of a resource pack for primary teachers and schools aimed at supporting the introduction of social, personal and health education as part of the revised curriculum for primary schools. This resource pack, entitled Be Safe, has been produced by the National Safety Council, with the co-operation of West Dublin Education Centre, to support teachers in developing the SPHE strand concerned with safety and protection and related issues, including road safety.</P>
      <P>Discussions have commenced between officials of my Department and the National Safety Council on issues concerning the introduction of Be Safe to all primary schools early in the next school year, 2000-01. The use of the National Safety Council resource pack by teachers will be included in the in-career development support provided for teachers as part of the introduction of the revised curriculum for primary schools. My Department will co-operate with the National Safety Council in encouraging teachers in using the resource provided.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the introduction of social, personal and health education to the curriculum at the junior cycle at post-primary level will be initiated in the near future. It is anticipated that the NCCA and my Department will have further discussions with the National Safety Council about the various safety issues, including road safety, which will form a part of the syllabus for SPHE at that level.</P>

      <P>Between 1990 and 1993, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment established a board of studies to examine science provision in the curriculum at senior cycle.</P>
      <P>This board raised the issue of a general science subject for leaving certificate. However, in the course of consultations it was clear that such a development was not widely supported at that time. There was however strong support for the development and modernisation of the existing provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this, work began on the revision of the existing science syllabuses &ndash; physics, <Col N="896" /> chemistry, biology, agricultural science and physics-chemistry combined. The physics and chemistry syllabuses are completed and are being introduced in schools in September, 2000. Work on biology and agricultural science is nearing completion, and I hope to be in a position to announce the date for the introduction of these revised courses shortly.</P>
    <P>The physics-chemistry combined course has been extensively revised and renamed physical science, and it will shortly be circulated by the NCCA for consultation. It contains many innovative elements associated with contemporary developments in science education.</P>
    <P>Following this consultative process, the NCCA will advise me on any further changes that may be needed in science provision at senior cycle. It is my intention to ensure that there is adequate syllabus provision at second level for students who want to study science.</P>

      <P>The provision of speech therapy services is the responsibility of the health authorities. My Department has sought information from the health authorities concerning the current level of speech provision to school going children and the shortfall, if any, which exists in this area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies may be aware, an expert group was established by the Minister for Health and Children in accordance with Labour Court Recommendation 15515 to address, <i>inter alia,</i> the education and training of certain paramedic grades, including speech therapists. I understand that the group has now reported to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, who is considering its report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that there is a shortage of certain health professionals and the terms of reference for a workforce study on physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists have been agreed. As an interim measure, my officials are in discussions with the Higher Education Authority to explore any potential for immediate increases in the intake to the relevant university programmes. I can <Col N="897" /> however advise Deputy Naughton that no discussions have taken place between either my Department or the Higher Education Authority and NUI Galway in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I will continue to liaise with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, in order to ensure an adequate supply of health professionals from the education system generally and that adequate speech therapy services are made available to school-going children who require such support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual school management authorities are charged with the direct governance of schools. In 1993 my Department issued guidelines on countering bullying behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
      <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. Management authorities are not required to notify my Department of bullying cases in schools.</P>
      <P>However, my Department receives telephone calls on a regular basis regarding reports of alleged instances of bullying. These calls are informal inquiries and advice and assistance is offered by departmental staff to the callers. In addition my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. In the 12 month period from July 1998 to June 1999, my Department examined approximately 20 cases of alleged bullying behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>Each of the 38 area based partnerships established training and education sub-committees as specified in the operational programme for urban and rural development 1994-99. The role of these committees is to identify how partnerships can best support education and training provision at local level in conjunction with mainstream providers as appropriate.</P>
      <P>My Department contributes to the planning work of these committees through my nominated representatives who are drawn from the Department's inspectorate and educational psychological services. In addition, each partnership has the services of an education co-ordinator, 12 full time and 26 part-time posts, which are funded by my Department. These co-ordinators, supported by a national co-ordinator based in area development management, assist in the identification and promotion of suitable initiatives, support cohesion of education initiatives within the partnerships and promote integration with community groups and agencies. I am satisfied that this support from my Department makes a substantial contribution to partnerships in identifying and developing additional local initiatives to tackle educational disadvantage in their areas.</P>
      <P>An integral part of the Department's strategy to address educational disadvantage is the promotion of enhanced links between schools and their communities. These links and partnership arrangements operate through the employment of home-school-community liaison co-ordinators in schools in disadvantaged areas; through the role of parents and community interests on school boards of management; through the work of the vocational education committees on local drugs task forces and in the area partnerships; through the co-ordinating activities of the youth service and through the requirement for multi-agency linkages as an integral aspect of the 8-15 early school and stay in school initiatives.</P>
      <P>Area referral networks with links to employment, training, youth, welfare, health, and probation services and with a wide range of community interests are part of the approach with such programmes as youthreach and the adult literacy service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, which is currently being discussed before the House, also makes provision for schools to work with organisations engaged in sporting activities or the provision of youth services. Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Bill provides that schools will, with assistance from the National Educational Welfare Board, prepare statements of strategy, setting out how they <Col N="899" /> intend to reduce the incidence of non-attendance by pupils in their schools. Subsection (2)(f2&gt;d) provides that these statements of strategy shall provide for &ldquo;the fostering, promoting and establishing of contacts by the school with other schools that provide primary or post-primary education and with bodies engaged in the provision of youth work programmes or services related thereto, or engaged in the organisation or sporting activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is my intention that this provision will enable schools to develop and engage in a network of local bodies, which have as a core focus the provision of services to children and young persons of school going age. This co-ordination of activities can only be beneficial to students. It will help to ensure that students receive a more holistic education, not limited purely to the school but embracing a wider section of the local community. In each instance, I would envisage the local school, through its board of management, as being the key actor in determining how, where and when these links should take place.</P>
    <P>However, I am also aware of the need to support schools in preparing and implementing these strategies. Therefore, section 22 also places a duty on the National Educational Welfare Board, through the preparation of guidelines nationally and the intervention of educational welfare officers locally, to support and assist schools in the preparation and implementation of these strategies.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Education (Welfare) Bill will be passed by this House in the near future to allow for a speedy enactment. This will allow for the establishment of the welfare service on a phased basis initially, focusing on areas of disadvantage and thereafter expanding to become a nation-wide service.</P>

The exact figure will not be known until the schools send in their returns to my Department in October 2000. In the current school year, some 23,500 students are taking the programme in 502 schools, 36% of the entire cohort.</P>
      <P>Projections for the uptake of the transition year programme in the school year 2000-2001 show an upward trend. By this time last year, 32 new schools had applied for the programme. The corresponding figure in the current year is 50 schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the transition year programme was revived and expanded in 1994, it has been the policy of my Department to allow schools to choose whether or not to offer it to their students. Recent research carried out by the Education Research Centre for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment shows considerable gains in terms of points attained at leaving certificate level by students who have taken the transition year programme over their peers who have not. Since the objectives of transition year do not include an increase in leaving certificate points, these findings do not in themselves constitute a reason for my Department to encourage more students to take the programme. The outcome of this research should, however, allay the fears sometimes expressed by parents that their children may lose their study skills during transition <Col N="901" /> year and encourage them to request more schools to provide the programme. Such requests always receive a favourable response from my Department.</P>

      <P>Section 28 of the Act was commenced on 23 December last and work is currently under way in my Department on drawing up the grievance and other procedures referred to. At primary level, consultations have been initiated with the education partners and it is expected that existing procedures will be updated before the commencement of the next school year. A similar consultation process will also be necessary in relation to second level and this will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>Section 29 allows for certain decisions made by a school to be appealed to the Secretary General of my Department. Planning work has commenced in relation to the structures and procedures necessary to implement this section. The necessary commencement order will then be made.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, was introduced specifically to relieve some of the supply pressure for student accommodation by providing a scheme of tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector.</P>
      <P>Given that the legislation and regulations are in place a relatively short time, I am satisfied with the progress to date. As relief will be available under the legislation for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create significant additional accommodation for third level students and therefore I do not propose to intervene further at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> The question of providing child care facilities in third level colleges is primarily a matter for the individual third level colleges. The higher education equality unit published a report &ldquo;Who cares in the Campus?&rdquo; on child care provision in higher education institutions in Ireland in November 1999. The report found that of the 40 institutions that responded to the 1998 All-Ireland survey, 30% provided child care support of some kind. It identifies the different levels of provision currently being made and highlights a number of issues for consideration by the colleges.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's plan to invest over £250 million within the national development plan on the development of a national child care infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In relation to steps being taken by my Department, I would point out to the Deputy that my Department's guidelines on the ESF-Aided Student Assistance-Access Fund for Third Level Institutions refers to the possibility of assisting students with family responsibilities, particularly in relation to child care costs, who face significant financial difficulties. As the Deputy may be aware, this fund amounted to £1.296 million in 1999 which represented a significant increase on previous provisions.</P>

      <P>Pre-school provision for the coming school year, other than infants classes in primary schools, will be as follows: early start pre-school pilot programme, catering for a maximum of 1,650 children; Rutland Street pre-school project, catering for up to 95 children; 52 pre-schools for Travellers catering for up to 520 Traveller children; and pilot pre-school provision for autistic children, catering for a maximum of 24 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, sets out a blueprint for the development of the sector. The White Paper will build on existing provision and assist providers to raise quality of provision. Support will continue to be made available for infant classes in primary schools and for the initiatives outlined above. In addition, the State may become involved in further direct provision in certain instances, where the educational needs of the White Paper priority groups &ndash; disadvantaged children or children with special <Col N="903" /> needs &ndash; are not being met by existing State-funded services.</P>
    <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper is currently under way in my Department.

      <P>In 1997, following the mid-term review of the operational programme 1994 to 1999, money was re-allocated for the support of a number of actions. Included in these was the allocation of £2.96 million over a two-year period to test models of support for young people between the ages of eight and 15 years who were at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving or were already outside the formal schools system. It was agreed that the programme would run during the two school years 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 and funding would end on 30 June 2000.</P>
      <P>Applications for support were invited from schools that were designated by my Department as serving areas of disadvantage and from the area-based partnerships in the operational programme. A core issue and a significant development in my Department's strategy for addressing educational disadvantage was included in this new early school leaver initiative for eight to 15 year olds. Consortia of agencies had to be formed at local level for the integrated delivery of a range of their services to the individual young people who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Funding was provided for 17 projects in 14 project areas and a projects' co-ordinator was appointed at national level to support the development of models of good practice that could be replicate in other areas of need. The projects are being evaluated by the children's research centre in Trinity College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have now decided that a new phase of the early school leaver initiative for eight to 15 year olds will run from 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002. Information meetings for representative personnel from the local project areas were held last week in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Funding for actions in the new period will be on the basis of a formal submission from each project area. Each submission will include an audit of existing resources and an account of current actions in the project areas in support of targeted young people at risk of educational disadvantage. They will propose a new costed programme of integrated <Col N="904" /> multi-agency supports for targeted young people and their families which will include in-school and out-of-school activities. Submissions must reach my Department by 19 May.</P>

      <P>An international adult literacy survey conducted in 1995 and published in 1997 provided a profile of the literacy skills of adults aged 16-64. About 25% of the Irish population were found to score at the lowest level, level 1, performing at best tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text with no distracting information, and when the structure of the text assists the task. The survey showed the ratio of unemployed to employed people scoring at the lowest literacy level in Ireland survey was 2:1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental group has been examining how best the literacy service can cater for the unemployed. It comprises the Departments of Education and Science, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FÁS, vocational education committees, the National Adult Literacy Agency and the local employment service. An interim report has been submitted to Government recommending: targets and timescales for an expansion of funding for the adult literacy service. These are being met within the context of the national development plan under which £73.6 million is being provided for adult literacy; an increase in provision of foundation and level 1 programmes under the VTOS element of the back to education initiative to enable progression from basic literacy into ongoing programmes, also in the national development plan; and an expansion of FÁS community employment literacy programmes and increased flexibility to enable a combination and mixing of schemes to enable vocational education committees and FÁS to respond to needs. FÁS has agreed to expand successful pilots in this area <Col N="905" /> to every FÁS region. The work of the Group is continuing.</P>
    <P>In addition, funding for adult literacy has increased from a base of £0.85 million in 1997 to £7.825 million in 2000 plus an additional £0.960 million for programme development; referral networks have been established on an area basis, involving key actors such as FÁS, the local employment service, the area partnerships, welfare and health interests, the Garda and probation services, schools, youth services, innovative approaches are expanding such as family literacy groups, involving both adults and their children, a number of open learning centres, literacy for specific groups such as Travellers, special needs, migrant women; a quality framework has been developed and nationally certified inservice programmes for staff are being implemented; and the Department has commissioned the development of a TV series in literacy awareness and tuition for adults. Work is under way in collaboration with RTE and NALA with a view to broadcasting towards the end of the year. The programmes will be accompanied by materials and a free helpline. As a result of these initiatives, the number of clients catered for annually by the literacy service has increased from 5,000 to 13,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 75 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. For the current academic year, the rates of the maintenance grants payable are set at £1,690 at the non-adjacent rate and £676 at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 1999-2000 academic year is £19,200 in a family with less than four dependent children. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part-maintenance grant, 50%, where the reckonable income does not exceed £20,400. Where two or more children or the candidate's parent are attending full-time approved third level courses the above income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, by £4,320 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,160.</P>
      <P>With some 40% of third level students qualifying for maintenance grants, any proposal that student grants be brought in line with social welfare payments for the unemployed would give rise to considerable cost, estimated by my Department to be in excess of £50 million per annum.</P>
      <P>I intend to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation and I intend to continue the practice of increasing the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases to the value of maintenance grants can only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund of £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. I am developing proposals <Col N="907" /> in relation to these financial supports and I will be announcing the details of the new arrangements in due course.</P>

      <P>Youthreach is targeted at young people aged 15-18 who left school with either minimal or no qualifications, generally those who attained less than five Ds at junior cycle level. Following the mid-term review of EU Structural Funds in 1998, a major expansion of places under Youthreach was agreed, increasing provision in FÁS and the vocational education committees from 4,525 to 7,162 places. The expansion was designed to address a critical shortfall in places and to increase opportunities for participants to progress to further education and training after the foundation stage of the programme. It was complemented by the provision for the first time of a guidance, counselling and psychological service measure and by child care provision within the VEC sector.</P>
      <P>This expansion happened side by side with a dramatic improvement in the economy and a rapid fall in overall unemployment. As a result, providers are having difficulty in filling places and are faced with a seepage from Youthreach into employment as job opportunities increase. I am satisfied, based on the feedback from centres, that there is no need at present for an increase in Youthreach full-time places nationally.</P>
      <P>However, it is intended that under the back to education initiative set out in the national development plan there will be an expansion of part-time education options under VTOS, Youthreach and PLC programmes, particularly aimed at those with less than upper secondary education. This will also enable existing full-time places to be re-deployed to part-time mode where appropriate. A major focus of this initiative will facilitate part-time and more flexible options within Youthreach so as to enable those who leave the programme mid-way to enter employment to continue their education on a part-time basis to gain qualifications. This will also enable education, employment and family responsibilities to be combined and help Youthreach to cater more effectively for lone parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am currently implementing a £194 million three-year multi-sectoral programme to offset educational disadvantage that will provide specific supports for early education, primary, post-primary and third levels of the formal system as well as life-long and continuing education. The supports will target people at risk of, or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. The supports will also be provided to those with poor levels of literacy skills as well as people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the new programme involves a survey of all primary schools to assess the level of concentration in each school of pupils who have background characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. I intend allocating additional resources next September to selected schools that have the highest concentrations of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people. Also, within this new approach, schools that are designated as serving areas of disadvantage will retain the supports they already have and may be eligible for additional help.</P>
      <P>A questionnaire, which was prepared by the educational research centre, ERC, Drumcondra, in consultation with officials in my Department, was issued to schools on 6 April and schools have been requested to return the completed questionnaires to the ERC by 20 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Analysis of the questionnaires will be completed at the end of May and the selected schools will be advised as soon as possible thereafter of <Col N="910" /> the additional resources that are being allocated to them. The resources allocated will reflect levels of need and their continued allocation will be re-assessed periodically.</P>

      <P>An amount of £5 million was provided in the 1999 budget to provide grants to schools that set up and run after school child care services. My Department is currently formulating details of a scheme for an after schools support service in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which has also been allocated £5 million to support community based groups to develop after school child care services in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that my Department's scheme will be confined to schools in disadvantaged areas which will be selected on the basis of criteria being developed by the educational research centre for the new more targeted child centred programme being introduced following a survey of all primary schools. The grant to each school would cover the cost of a co-ordinator and other personnel and would include other operating costs such as insurance, heating and lighting. It is envisaged that this scheme will be operational in the schools selected by September next.</P>
      <P>My Department has also provided £2.3 million this year for child care to support access of participants to Youthreach, traveller training centre programmes for early school leavers and the vocational training opportunity scheme for the unemployed. The funds are allocated to the vocational education committees for direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on existing commercial or community crèches and for the payment of childminders subject to compliance with tax and registration requirements under the Child Care Acts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> I am pleased to inform the Deputies that new measures were introduced recently to ensure that there is appropriate educational provision in place for non-English speaking pupils at primary school level.</P>
    <P>Primary schools which have 15 or more non-national pupils with significant English language deficits will be automatically entitled to an additional temporary teacher for a period of up to two years. Schools with 35 or more such pupils will be entitled to two temporary teachers. Where two schools operate on one campus and have 15 or more such pupils they will be entitled to an additional temporary teacher on a shared basis. Schools eligible for additional teacher(s) will also receive a once-off grant of £200.</P>
    <P>Primary schools in which between four and 14, inclusive, non-English speaking non-national pupils are enrolled will receive grant assistance. Schools with between four and nine such pupils will receive grant assistance in the amount of £5,000 while schools with between ten and 14 will receive grant assistance in the amount of £7,500. This grant aid is intended to enable schools to take appropriate measures to improve the standard of English of non-national pupils with significant English language deficits. Schools with three or fewer such pupils are expected to provide for the educational provisions of those pupils from their existing resources. Managerial authorities of schools with non-national primary pupils enrolled who have significant English language deficits should submit an application for assistance to the primary branch of my Department.</P>
    <P>At second level, my Department has allocated approximately 12 whole-time equivalent teaching posts in the current school year specifically to cater for the needs of children who do not speak English as their first language. Individual post-primary schools or vocational education committees may apply for additional teaching hours in respect of non-national students who may have particular English language deficits.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the arrangements in relation to the allocation of teachers to cater for the education of refugees and asylum seekers will be subject to review. In addition, the refugee language support unit, established under the auspices of Trinity College, will be provided with a budget of the order of £1.2 million over the period of the programme to co-ordinate action for language tuition for refugees to assist them along the pathway to independent living. The unit's functions are fulfilled in co-operation with the Refugee Agency, FÁS and refugee groups themselves. In addition, refugees are among the groups catered for as part of the adult literacy programme provided by the vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>There are some 24,000 promotion posts, including principal posts, in our primary and second level schools. This number of promotion posts provides significant promotion opportunities for teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The filling of promotion posts in schools is primarily a matter for the management authority of <Col N="913" /> each school in accordance with appointment procedures agreed between the managerial authorities, teacher unions and my Department.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been raised that certain elements of those procedures that relate to seniority for promotion purposes may be indirectly discriminatory on gender grounds under the terms of the Employment Equality Act, 1998. Arising from those concerns I understand that management authorities have not proceeded with the filling of certain promotion posts.</P>
    <P>My Department has sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General's in relation to these concerns and my Department is in discussion with that office on the complex issues involved. While the Employment Equality Act is largely untested law, my objective is to ensure that as far as practicable there is in place a system of promotion which conforms with the spirit and letter of the Act. It is further my intention that immediate discussions will take place with the managerial bodies and teacher unions when the advice of the the Attorney General's office is available in order to reach agreement on any changes that may be required in procedures.</P>

      <P>The issue of raising the skills profile of people and of addressing the skills needs of the economy has been identified as a key priority in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in the national employment action plan. Over the past few years, a range of initiatives has been introduced to enhance co-operation between education and business and to ensure that our education system adequately responds to emerging labour market needs. These initiatives will be built upon in the planned educational investment outlined in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring an adequate supply of high quality output from the institutes of technology and universities at sub-degree, degree and post-graduate levels in order to maintain and enhance our ability to attract and retain highly mobile international investment in an increasingly knowledge based global economy. The Government established the expert group on future skills needs as part of the business, education and training partnership set up to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skill needs, manpower needs estimation, and edu<Col N="914" /> cation and training for business. In response to the first report of the expert group on future skills needs, the Government provided a £75 million investment plan to provide an additional 5,400 places predominantly in the engineering and computer hardware and software areas.</P>
    <P>The second report of the expert group on future skills needs has recently been published. In the area of graduate skills, the report considered the chemical and biological sciences sector and made a number of recommendations, which are currently being considered.</P>
    <P>Another initiative in this area is the provision of some 1,500 postgraduate places on a skills conversion programme for 1999-2000 to meet skills needs in the ICT area as identified by the expert skills group.</P>
    <P>Arising from the work of the joint education-industry task force to improve the supply of technicians to the high-technology sector, an industry-college initiative was introduced in 1998 to jointly recruit, educate and train technicians. The national certificate in manufacturing technology was initiated in January 1998 in nine institutes of technology. The course involves structured work placement for six months as an integral part of the course and based on a partnership between industry and institutes with industrial involvement in course design, selection and placement. There are some 1,100 students currently on accelerated technician programmes in the institute of technology sector attending courses in the following skills shortage areas &ndash; manufacturing technology, computing &ndash; IT support &ndash; and industrial science.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the significant investment being made in research in higher education primarily through the programme for research in third level institutions and the commitment to research in the national development plan. This investment acknowledges the importance of creating a leading edge research environment in higher education, which will both facilitate the training of future graduates and post-graduates to international standards and will have a positive impact on the quality of education and training delivered in higher education institutions.</P>

      <P>Children with special needs can be catered for in special schools, in special classes attached to ordinary schools or in mainstream classes on an integrated basis where special support services can be provided. The choice of placement is normally based on the severity of the special need.</P>
      <P>All special schools and special classes enjoy reduced pupil teacher ratios. The ratios in question range from 11:1 down to 6:1 depending on the particular disability involved. Children attending special schools and special classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding and special funding is also made available for materials and equipment.</P>
      <P>Children with special needs who are attending ordinary classes on a fully integrated basis may require special teaching or child care support. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to the support services they require to enable them to benefit fully from the education system. The service in question may take the form of resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the particular needs involved. Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated more than 300 additional resource teachers and more than 700 child care assistants to cater for children with special needs within the primary system. My Department is continuing to extend these services in response to assessed needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> Also, in September 1999 the remedial teacher service was extended to every first and second level school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. Schools with lower ratios have also been advised that they may apply to my Department for a remedial service where they can demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The study of attrition rates is a complex one and figures on attrition across higher education have not yet been established on a common and comparable basis. There is no simple explanation and no one simple initiative that will address the issue. Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved. There must also, of course, be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the <Col N="917" /> necessary, objective standards. The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>In relation to the overall retention rate in the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994, which indicated a completion rate of 81%, which is high by international standards, for those entering in 1989-90. The authority has commissioned the educational research centre, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area and a report is expected shortly. The study will consider a range of factors as to their effect on completion rates such as socio-economic factors, entry requirements, time of enrolment, availability of repeat examinations and the transition from second to third level education.</P>
      <P>The Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology has also commissioned the educational research centre, Drumcondra to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the institutes and the research project team is in the process of collating the necessary data.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is also conducting a two-year quantitative and qualitative investigation of student withdrawal within the Institute which is a similar and comparable study to that commissioned by the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology.</P>
      <P>The above studies are being funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, I am supporting and promoting a number of initiatives in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a database on attrition/drop-out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues. The Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology has established a national committee on retention with representatives from each institute to focus on &ldquo;maximising success rates&rdquo; for institutes' students. The committee has assembled a profile of current good practice in relation to retention across the sector. The profile has been made available to all institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Institutes of technology continue to introduce a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. These include induction/orientation programmes, course information services, tutor services and systems designed for the early identification of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; first year students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a two-year funding initiative to tackle educational disadvantage at third level, I am providing £1.5 million over the period 1999-2000 to address the issue of non-completion in the technological sector. This funding supports and complements the programmes already in place and has regard to the recommendations of the national committee on retention in relation to the funding of action projects/programmes both short and long-term based on best practice.

    <P>Through these initiatives the institutes are developing their strategies and from this year a dedicated member of staff is being assigned to work with students and staff to develop mechanisms aimed at improving retention rates. Considerable work is also being done in collaboration with the National Centre for Guidance in Education and with the post primary inspectorate in my Department to develop other positive actions in this area.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, was introduced specifically to relieve some of the supply pressure for student accommodation by providing a scheme of tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector. Properties qualifying for relief under the scheme are campus areas of the educational institution, or areas, within an eight kilometre radius of the main campus, which are approved by the educational institution as being an area within which a qualifying development may take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the legislation and regulations are in place a relatively short time I am satisfied with the progress to date. As relief will be available under the legislation for expenditure up to 31 March 2003, the opportunity exists to create sig<Col N="919" /> nificant additional accommodation for third level students and, therefore, I do not propose to intervene further at this stage.</P>

      <P>The new primary school curriculum for English has been issued to all schools, and during this school year all primary school teachers have undertaken an in-career course in regard to its implementation.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental principle of the curriculum in English that the child's language competence, attention span, concentration and perceptual abilities should be well developed before being introduced to a formal reading scheme. Consequently, much of the English programme in the child's first year at school will be devoted to oral language and informal reading activities that introduce pupils to print in the environment and to books that are interesting, exciting and pleasurable.</P>
      <P>A basic principle of the curriculum is to cater for individual differences. Pupils' states of readiness for reading vary significantly and teachers are advised to evaluate the readiness of individual pupils and match the teaching of reading to pupils' abilities and needs. Pupils differ and it would not be appropriate to issue a directive prohibiting the teaching of reading to all junior infants.</P>
      <P>It is important that schools explain their policies on the implementation of the reading programme to parents so that they are aware of the range of individual differences in pupils and of the necessity to use different approaches to suit individual children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>A system of continuous assessment could of course be developed for use in the certificate examinations but it must be realised that there are serious practical constraints in releasing teachers from school if such assessment were to be conducted externally. Continuous assessment is in reality only a viable option if it is school based.</P>
      <P>The issue of teacher release and the consequent disruption in schools also places a practical constraint on the development of alternative modes of assessment generally.</P>
      <P>A discussion paper was prepared by my Department in relation to assessment issues at junior certificate as a further contribution to the consultation process begun with the circulation of the Junior Cycle Review Progress Report by the NCCA.</P>
      <P>The discussion paper notes that in the case of the leaving certificate assessment leads to certification for selection and that the integrity of such a system must be beyond question. Consequently in such a high stakes environment the concerns of teachers in relation to participation in school-based assessment are understandable. The paper argues that in the case of the junior certificate there should be scope for change because its value no longer lies predominately in providing certification for selection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>A survey of science facilities was conducted to determine the state of the existing science infrastructure within second level schools, and to inform decisions concerning the optimum approach to targeting resources at schools that offer the physical science subjects.</P>
      <P>One of the key findings of the survey was the perceived inadequacy of equipment within science laboratories. In particular, it was noted that the vast majority of schools do not use information technology facilities in the teaching of the physical sciences. In response, my Department is currently in the process of paying a grant of £1,500 to all qualifying schools to be used for acquiring items of equipment for use in the laboratory. Additionally, a grant of £2,500 is being paid to all qualifying schools for the purposes of acquiring a multi-media PC with DVD drive, printer, and related hardware and software. These latter payments are in addition to an increase by £10 in the annual capitation grant for each student studying the physical sciences. This increased grant was paid to schools for the first time at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>A total of £12 million is being made available over a three-year period for the improvement of resources for the teaching of science on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>The survey also revealed a need for a greater awareness among managerial authorities of schools concerning health and safety issues within science laboratories. In this context, the survey revealed that the majority of science laboratories do not have a fire extinguisher, smoke detector, first aid kit, or a fire blanket. My Department has written to all schools drawing the attention of managerial authorities to their statutory obligation under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, to have a safety statement in place and to ensure that there are adequate safety precautions and safety equipment in place in science laboratories.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed also that there is a need to upgrade the services within the majority of science laboratories. Accordingly, schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded.</P>
      <P>For all other schools that offer science subjects, consideration is being given to the most appropriate mechanisms to fund an upgrade of services within laboratories in the context of the overall needs of the school.</P>

      <P>Teacher estimates derived from the national reading surveys indicate that nearly 10% of pupils in fifth class at primary level have serious literacy difficulties. Tackling this serious problem for our young children is one of the top priorities for me, as Minister.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of primary schools already engage in annual assessments of their pupils' reading using standardised tests. There is a deep understanding among teachers already of the importance of regular assessment of their pupils' achievements. To date, schools have mainly used test results for reporting to parents and for the identification of pupils with reading difficulties.</P>
      <P>I am exploring ways of making a wider range of assessment instruments available to primary schools to assist them in their work. As a first step I am providing all schools with copies of the Drumcondra English Profiles before the end of the present school year. These instruments will be used in addition to standardised norm-referenced tests to enable teachers to build up a profile of each pupil's strengths and weaknesses. The use of the profiles will enable teachers to plan reading, writing and language programmes to suit the individual needs of each pupil. Training in the use of the profiles will be provided as part of the support programme for the implementation of the revised primary curriculum.</P>
      <P>I also intend to conduct a programme of national surveys of English reading at primary level on a regular basis, in conjunction with the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra. I will continue the series of surveys at fifth class level and extend the programme to include pupils at second/third class level.</P>
      <P>The use of particular standardised tests by schools and the system of profiling pupil achievements in English combined, will be the basis for the benchmarking and comparative analysis of performance nationally and locally to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>In October 1996, my Department published a manual, Safety in School Science: A <Col N="924" /> Code of Practice and issued it to all schools. It contains general guidelines for best practice in school science, including a section on laboratory organisation and management which deals with matters such as storage, stock control and waste disposal.</P>
      <P>At the same time, my Department published a manual which it commissioned from Forbairt entitled Safety in the School Laboratory: Disposal of Chemicals. This manual gives clear guidelines on the disposal of individual chemicals which are commonly found in school science laboratories. The manual explains how most of these chemicals may be safely disposed of in schools in accordance with the instructions given. My Department also contracted Forbairt to operate a help-line to further assist schools at that time.</P>
      <P>To assess the range and volume of chemicals, a questionnaire was issued to all second level schools in October 1996. They were asked to identify and report on the amount of certain chemicals which are no longer required for school purposes and which could not be disposed of by the school in accordance with the guidelines given. The completed returns were collated and analysed by the curriculum development unit, CDU, of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. A report by CDU of this analysis was issued to all schools in February 1998.  </P>
      <P>Having regard to the results of the survey, my Department in conjunction with CDU and the Health and Safety Authority arranged for a training programme to provide further assistance and advice for all second level schools on disposal and storage issues. The programme was conducted in April and June 1998 for science teachers from all second level schools. It was intended that this training programme would enable schools to review further their chemical stocks, to arrange for the safe storage of chemicals which will be required for future use and to arrange for the disposal of unwanted chemicals which can be disposed of safely by schools in accordance with the guidelines already given.</P>
      <P>Although it remains the direct responsibility of school authorities to manage their stocks of chemicals and ensure the safety of students, staff and property, my Department has recognised that a co-ordinated strategy is required to deal with the problem of unwanted chemicals which cannot be disposed of within schools. My Department will be in contact with schools shortly to ensure that the information available on chemical stocks is fully up-to-date.</P>
      <P>During 1999 my Department carried out a pilot exercise with 19 community and comprehensive Schools in the Dublin area to engage disposal contractors to identify and remove unwanted chemicals. Based on the results of the pilot study my Department is in the process of putting a comprehensive strategy in place to deal with the chemicals in question in the remaining schools.</P>

      <P>The declining uptake of science subjects at second level relates specifically to the physical sciences at senior level and is a matter of concern to me. The problem is a multifaceted one and Ireland is by no means unique in this regard. It affects most countries in the developed world to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
      <P>A wide-ranging initiative is now being implemented by me to help address this issue.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to female pupils, last week I launched comprehensive reference handbooks for teachers of physics and chemistry. The production of these handbooks constitutes part of the final phase of a major initiative aimed at increasing the participation of females in the study of the physical sciences at senior cycle.</P>
      <P>This initiative, known as the intervention project in physics and chemistry, was implemented as part of my Department's equality of opportunity programme. It involved providing experienced teachers to introduce these subjects to schools that did not have them on the curriculum and providing support to other schools in the region. In all, over 100 schools were involved with this scheme and it has been very successful in encouraging more girls to study the physical science subjects. The number of girls studying chemistry at present is almost the same as the number of boys. The final phase of the scheme also includes the setting up of science resource centres in selected regions.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the measures currently being implemented by my Department will make a significant contribution to addressing the issue, including the under-representation of girls in the physical sciences.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that about 10% of Irish pupils at primary level have serious literacy difficulties arising from various causes. It is recognised that a small percentage of pupils among those have a specific reading disability or dyslexia. The early detection of reading difficulties is a function of class and remedial teachers. A variety of tests, standardised and diagnostic are used for this purpose. Where dyslexia is suspected, assessment by a psychologist is required.</P>
      <P>Where teachers observe behaviours in pupils such as very poor attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, and where there is a co-existing learning difficulty, they may refer such pupils for assessment by a psychologist or child psychiatrist for possible diagnosis of attention deficit disorder.</P>
      <P>It is considered that the present practice of identification and diagnosis of these difficulties by pupils' teachers, by psychologists assigned to schools and by clinical psychologists and child psychiatrists is the most effective way of ensuring timely and appropriate interventions.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated 1,465 remedial teachers and approximately 300 resource teachers at primary level to support pupils with difficulties such as those referred to by the Deputy. In addition, there are several special schools and special classes for these pupils. I am satisfied that these services constitute an adequate response to the special needs of the pupils concerned.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the principal objective of the White Paper on Early Childhood Education is &ldquo;to support the development and educational achievement of children through high quality early education, with particular focus on the target groups of the disadvantaged and those with special needs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive early education strategy in respect of children who are disadvantaged. A key element of this strategy will involve continued support and improvement to existing programmes, including Early Start. This strategy will be informed by the outcome of evaluations carried out in relation to the Early Start programme and the need to ensure the development of best practice for early childhood education for the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper, including proposals concerning children who are disadvantaged, is currently under way in my Department.</P>
      <P>Key principles underpinning the White Paper are that implementation will be undertaken on a phased basis and that progress will be achieved through a process of consultation with interested parties. My officials are currently in discussion with parties involved in the early childhood education area with a view to implementing the White Paper proposals and establishing the necessary structures. This process will be concluded shortly.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to make further announcements in this matter over coming months.</P>

      <P>The revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994. The programme is funded by the Department of Health and Children and is fully operational since 1998. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. While undertaking the diploma programme, the students' fees are paid by the relevant health agency and they receive an annual non means-tested maintenance grant and other supports.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children consulted a number of colleges on the development of accessible degree programmes, which would be open both to nurses graduating under the revised programme and to nurses who graduated under the traditional model of education and training. These programmes were intended to offer post-registration qualifications on a part-time basis. A number of part-time degree programmes have been introduced on a self-financing basis and I understand that it is open to nurses who are employed by health agencies to apply to their employers for financial support towards the cost of undertaking such courses. Part-time courses do not come within the scope of the free fees initiative. Tax relief is available at the standard rate, under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> The National University of Ireland, Galway, has introduced a one year full-time nursing degree programme for students who have completed the three year nursing diploma programme. As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Health and Children has stated that his Department is not in a position to meet the fees of students undertaking this programme.</P>
    <P>This degree course has not been included within the scope of my Department's free fees initiative. As this matter is at issue in the case of Sarena Tansey and Others f2&gt;v. the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Health and Children, the Western Health Board, Ireland and the Attorney General, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I refer to the recommendation of the Commission on Nursing that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses be based on a four year degree programme, the third year of which will involve a 12 month continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. The commission further recommended that no third-level institution should introduce a pre-registration nursing degree programme before the start of the 2002-03 academic year. The Nursing Education Forum has been established to prepare a strategy for the implementation of the new four year pre-registration nursing degree programme for the intake of nursing students in 2002.</P>

      <P>At junior certificate the level of participation in science is very satisfactory, with almost 90% of the cohort studying the subject.</P>
      <P>At leaving certificate the level of participation in biology is also satisfactory, with approximately 47% of the cohort studying the subject. Although there has been a slight decline in recent years, this level of participation is high by international standards. In Scotland, for example, about one third of senior pupils study biology.</P>
      <P>The issue of the uptake of the physical science subjects at leaving certificate level is a matter of concern to me for some time. The declining uptake of the physical sciences at leaving certificate level is a multifaceted problem and Ireland is by no means unique in this regard. In fact, it affects most countries in the developed world to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide-ranging initiative to address the issue is now being implemented. It includes the following elements: Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry are <Col N="931" /> being introduced from next September, along with teachers' guidelines and comprehensive reference handbooks for teachers of these subjects. A review of the junior certificate science syllabus is being undertaken by the NCCA at present. A new physical science syllabus to replace the combined physics and chemistry syllabus, is being prepared by the NCCA at present. The accessibility of ordinary level examination papers in junior certificate science and in leaving certificate physics and chemistry has been addressed. A new format examination paper in junior certificate science will be introduced in this year's examination. The structure and layout of questions in leaving certificate physics and chemistry was initially addressed in the 1999 papers and it is intended that further progress will be made in this year's papers. Sample materials in relation to these adjustments to these papers have been circulated to schools. A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry at both leaving certificate and junior certificate levels is being implemented. All teachers of leaving certificate physics and chemistry will have been provided with two and half days of in-service training by the end of this school year. A significant refurbishment programme for school laboratories is under way. Schools have recently been notified of a capital grant of £1,500 for the purchase of equipment and of funding of up to £2,500 towards the purchase of a PC and related hardware and software specifically for use in the science laboratories. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant for pupils studying each of the three leaving certificate subjects physics, chemistry and physics and chemistry, was paid to schools last term.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the importance of these subjects in the context of our economic development and I will continue to keep the situation in relation to these subjects under review. I am confident that the measures currently being implemented by my Department will make a significant contribution to addressing the issue of the declining uptake of the physical sciences.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recent report of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment From Junior to Leaving Certificate &ndash; which was a longitudinal study of 1994 junior certificate candidates who took the leaving certificate examination in 1997. The report indicates that there is a high correlation <Col N="932" /> between the performance in the junior certificate and the leaving certificate examinations. There is however evidence of poorer performance at leaving certificate level by candidates who took subjects at ordinary and foundation level in the junior certificate than by candidates who took the same subjects at higher level in the junior certificate examination.</P>
      <P>There are other reasons for differences in grades achieved at leaving certificate level in subjects in comparison to grades achieved in these subjects at junior certificate level: different and smaller cohorts may take a subject at leaving certificate level thereby making direct comparison to junior certificate results not fully valid; subjects also differ in terms of their complexity; subjects may have more than one component in terms of assessment (i.e. practical, oral or aural) in addition to written; results may also vary between subjects depending on whether there is one or more components in terms of assessment in the examination.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is my intention to provide wider forms of assessment at leaving certificate level, where possible, with less reliance on the terminal written examination alone.</P>
      <P>A fully comprehensive system of marking is in place in both the leaving and junior certificate examinations to ensure that the work of all candidates is marked fully in accordance with the agreed marking scheme decided upon at the marking conference. The work of all examiners is monitored to a significant degree to ensure conformity with the marking scheme.  </P>

      <P>While the total number of mature students currently in universities is not available, the Commission on the Points System noted that the most recent available figures suggest that about 5% of those entering full-time undergraduate higher education courses are mature students, i.e. over 23 years of age on 1 January of their year of entry. The statistical information available from the Higher Education Authority HEA &ndash; in respect of the 1997-98 academic year indicates that 7% of all new entrants to full-time undergraduate programmes in the Higher Education Authority sector are age 23 and over at 1 January, 1998. The proportion of all full-time students in the Higher Education Authority sector, aged 23 and over, was almost 22%.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Points System recommended that by 2005, each institution should set aside a quota of at least 15% of places for students entering at age 23 or over. It also highlighted a need for greater opportunities for students to return to third-level education on a part-time basis. The Review Committee on Post-Secondary Education identified the need to increase provision for mature students both to tackle under provision in the past and to cater for the demands imposed by the need for life-long learning. The committee recommended the provision of an additional stock of up to 10,000 places for mature students to be built up over a period of years, primarily but not exclusively by increased part-time provision and other flexible options such as distance learning.</P>

    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness addresses the issue of mature student participation at higher education and provides for the establishment of a group, with appropriate social partner involvement, to examine and report on barriers to participation by mature students in higher education. The group will advise my <Col N="935" /> Department on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by mature students to third level education building on the experience of current initiatives. As the Deputy may be aware the Higher Education Authority provides targeted funding to its institutions for initiatives designed to support the participation of mature students, particularly second chance students.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of information about the demand from mature students which was highlighted by both the points commission and the Review Committee on Post-Secondary Education.  My Department has requested the Higher Education Authority to undertake market research to establish the level and range of demand from mature students. The authority has also been requested to bring forward proposals in relation to the provision of mature student places.</P>

      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper is currently under way in my Department. My implementation priorities are the development of quality standards for early childhood education and the necessary structures to promote the quality in education mark among early education providers and parents. I am also anxious to develop further the early childhood provision for the disadvantaged and pupils with special needs as envisaged in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The proposals concerning quality in education cover a wide range of areas including curriculum guidelines, methodologies, staff qualifications and training. The development of standards in these and other areas will be undertaken in consultation with interested parties and experts in the early education field. While progress in this area will be a priority, development of the quality standards will take some time. A significant amount of research into international best practice will be required in order to ensure the highest possible quality of early education for young children. The development of the quality in education mark will be underpinned by support, evaluation and inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key principles underpinning the White Paper are that implementation will be undertaken on a phased basis and that progress will be achieved through a process of consultation with interested parties. My officials are currently in discussion with parties involved in the early childhood edu<Col N="936" /> cation area with a view to implementing the White Paper proposals and establishing the necessary structures. This process will be concluded shortly.</P>

      <P>Certain Montessori teachers are granted restricted recognition to teach in certain special schools and classes. In addition, my Department has recently decided that such teachers are also eligible to apply for and take up positions as resource teachers for pupils with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Montessori teachers who are entitled to restricted recognition are teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale, AMI, College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dun Laoghaire, who have successfully <Col N="937" /> completed the Diploma or Degree in Humanities in Montessori Education recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>Montessori teachers are not currently recognised as fully qualified primary teachers or as remedial teachers, since they may be required to teach the full primary curriculum to the pupils to whom they are assigned.</P>
    <P>Issues related to the training and qualifications of primary teachers are kept under review. At present the existing pre-service training of primary teachers is being reviewed. A working group undertaking that review is expected to complete its work before the summer. Following completion of that review it is proposed to put in place a review of the recognition of Montessori teachers as primary teachers and for remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, which was published last December, sets out a range of proposals concerning educational provision for children aged from birth to six years,. Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in Ready to Learn, including those which relate to Montessori teachers, is currently under way in my Department.

      <P>Recruitment to the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, is organised by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. The Commission has now completed the process of selecting additional suitably qualified psychologists, who will join the agency in two stages. It is hoped that the first group will begin to take up their posts during the current school year.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that, by the end of the year 2000, when the current selection process has been completed, nearly 100 psychologists will be in post. As this is half the eventual target of 200 psychologists, by the end of this year there will be a marked improvement in the level of service being offered by NEPS.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that there was considerable interest in the current competition, with over 250 applications received by the commission. As a result, the recruitment process has taken longer than anticipated, since short-listing and interviewing of this number of applicants took a considerable amount of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and  116 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that managerial authorities of primary schools in certain areas are experiencing difficulties in obtaining the services of fully qualified teachers.</P>
      <P>However, a range of measures have been introduced to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. The intake of trainee primary teachers to the Colleges of Education was increased substantially in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C honours in the leaving certificate are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
      <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. Such teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputies that EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</P>
      <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any difficulties in the recruitment or retention of teachers in second level schools. If the Deputies have any particular areas or schools in mind I will have the matter examined if they supply me with the relevant details.</P>

      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is charged with overall responsibility for co-ordinating child care service delivery arrangements. An investment of £250 million is being provided to expand provision in this area under the national development plan. This will provide for capital grants and grants towards staffing for community based childcare facilities, training and supports to national voluntary and child care organisations, the networking of child care providers, and a new capital grant scheme for independent child care service providers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the education sector, my Department is providing £2.3 million this year for child care to support access of participants to Youthreach and Traveller training centre programmes for early school leavers, and the vocational training opportunity scheme for the unemployed. The funds are allocated to vocational education committees for direct provision of creches, purchase of places on existing commercial or community creches, and payment of child minders subject to compliance with tax and registration requirements under the Child Care Acts. Some 420 children have benefited to date from the measure. While it is hoped that this will increase over the period ahead, feedback to date indicates a shortage of available child minders and a fear of transferring from the black economy. Rapidly rising child care and building costs, growth in other employment opportunities, and a fall-off nationally in the supply of child minding places has added to difficulties in progressing the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amount of £5 million has been provided in the 1999 budget to provide grants to schools that set up and run after school child care services. My Department is currently formulating details of a scheme for an after schools support service in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which has also been <Col N="940" /> allocated £5 million to support community based groups to develop after school child care services in disadvantaged areas. Officials from my Department participate in a synergy group and a child care co-ordinating committee convened by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in order to ensure an integrated approach.</P>

      <P>While the prevention of suicide is an issue for a range of agencies, I acknowledge the role of schools in preventing this tragic and serious occurrence, especially in young people.</P>
      <P>The report of the National Task Force on Suicide, published in January 1998, made a number of recommendations on prevention in the education area. These were: that teachers be supported in respect of the psychological and social dimensions of their work through continuous professional courses; that programmes be initiated aimed at teaching children positive health issues; that guidance counsellors be available to all schools and that the psychological services for schools be extended.</P>
      <P>Social personal and health education, SPHE, is being introduced as part of the revised curriculum for primary schools. This subject is also to be introduced as a core part of the junior cycle curriculum at second level. Colleges of education and university departments of education are taking account of this change. Ongoing in-career development for teachers will be an integral part of the introduction of SPHE and is already available on a regular basis as part of the support for substance misuse prevention education, and relationships and sexuality education programmes at both primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>The provision of counselling in schools has been improved at post-primary level by the sanction of a minimum of eight hours counselling per week for schools with 200 students or less, one full-time counselling post for schools with 500 students or more and up to two full-time counselling posts for schools with 1,000 students or more.</P>
      <P>A National Educational Psychological Service Agency was established by my Department in September 1999. The agency will employ 200 educational psychologists between now and the year 2004. The process of recruiting up to 50 additional educational psychologists for the agency is under way and these additional psychologists will become available during the current year.</P>

      <P>A number of strategies have already been put in place to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>The revised primary curriculum has been sent to all schools and a major in-career development programme is under way. The programme places an increased emphasis in the English curriculum on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills as part of a whole-language process.</P>
      <P>The new leaving certificate English syllabus has a particular emphasis on literacy, comprehension and composition, and follows on from the revised junior certificate syllabus.</P>
      <P>The remedial teaching service has been increased and now comprises of 1,463 remedial teachers at primary level and over 500 at second level who support pupils with diagnosed literacy and other learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>In December 1998 all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 for the purchase of library books, with schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage receiving an additional £2,170 each. In October 1999 a minimum grant of £462 was issued to schools with 60 pupils or less for the purchase of library books, while schools with in excess of 60 pupils received a per capita grant of £7.70.</P>
      <P>The national reading initiative launched in January is a national effort to tackle the problem of poor reading achievements and to promote reading generally. The initiative acknowledges that the problem of low achievement and underachievement is not just a school-based problem. It stresses the importance of parents encouraging their children, by reading to them to develop their vocabulary and imagination and by listening to them read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to adults, funding for adult literacy has increased from a base of £0.85 million in 1997 to £7.825 million in 2000 plus an additional £0.960 million for programme development; £73.6 million is being provided under the national development plan for the period 2000-06; referral networks have been established on an area basis, involving key actors such as FÁS, the local employment service, the area partnerships, welfare and health interests, the Garda and probation services, schools, youth services, to promote awareness of the service, and provide a structured mechanism for the identification of area needs and the referral of those in need to the service; innovative approaches are expanding such as family literacy groups, involving both adults and their children, a number of open learning centres, literacy for specific groups such as Travellers, special needs, migrant women; an <Col N="942" /> interdepartmental literacy group has been established and has made an interim report to Government; programmes for the unemployed in co-operation with FÁS and the community employment scheme are being expanded to every FÁS region following a successful pilot; a quality framework has been developed and nationally certified inservice programmes for staff are being implemented and the Department has commissioned the development of a TV series in literacy awareness and tuition for adults. Work is under way in collaboration with RTE and NALA with a view to broadcasting towards the end of the year. The programmes will be accompanied by materials and a free helpline.</P>
    <P>As a result of these initiatives, the number of clients catered for annually by the literacy service has increased from 5,000 to 13,000.</P>

      <P>In March of 1999, my Department formally requested the Office of Public Works to undertake a pilot survey of 196 schools in the south-east of the country to determine the location, type, form and condition of any asbestos material present and the steps necessary to manage the problem. The intention of my Department in conducting the sample survey was to obtain information on the likely scale and extent of the presence of asbestos in school buildings nationwide. The initial survey was completed in July 1999 by a firm of specialist consultants commissioned by the Office of Public Works. It identified an asbestos presence in some form or another in 59 of the 196 schools surveyed, that is, about 30%.</P>
      <P>Although generally speaking the condition of the material was found to be good and posed no immediate health risk, its removal where possible was recommended and a programme of works was commenced immediately with funding made available from my Department. Remediation work has now been completed in most of the 59 schools identified in the survey.</P>
      <P>The initial survey has since been extended to all schools nationwide, primary and post-primary, and the management authorities and principals of every school were informed of this in December 1999. Following on this phase of the survey, a programme of works involving remediation at 60 schools is currently under way and a further programme involving 58 schools is being prepared for the summer when the schools are closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, <Col N="943" /> either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements to undertake the work in accordance with the relevant health and safety legislation are made by my Department and the Office of Public Works. The entire cost of the programme of detection and removal is being borne by my Department. The necessary level of funding will continue to be allocated to the programme as a priority.</P>

I would like to place on record my appreciation of the co-operation of the colleges of education in achieving this increase.</P>
      <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C honours in the leaving certificate are paid at the <Col N="944" /> trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Higher Education Authority will be publishing the report of the technical working group on the review of Outreach centres of higher education institutions, which was chaired by Professor Noel Mulcahy, this week. As previously indicated, I have asked the authority to consider the recommendations in the report and advise me accordingly.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the role of outreach centres forms part of the wider area of open and distance learning and the Higher Education Authority and Oscail, the National Distance Education Centre, jointly hosted a symposium on the future of open and distance learning in higher education in Ireland last month. I understand that a rapporteur's report on the symposium is being prepared.</P>
      <P>Another relevant issue in this regard is the work that the Higher Education Authority has been asked to undertake in the light of the report of review committee on post secondary education and training places, which was chaired by Dr Donal deBuitleir. The market research that the authority has been asked to undertake in relation to mature students and the proposals that it will bring forward in relation to the provision of mature student places are of particular relevance in this regard.</P>

      <P>Since its appointment to office, this Government has brought about an unprecedented level of improvement in special education services, both for children attending mainstream schools on an integrated basis and for children attending special dedicated facilities.</P>
      <P>Since September 1997 the pupil teacher ratios applicable in all special schools and special classes have been reduced to the level recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>Also, arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to the support services they require to enable them to benefit fully from the education system. The services in question may take the form of resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the assessed needs of the individual child involved. Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated more than 300 resource teacher posts and more than 700 special needs assistant posts to cater for special needs children in the primary system. I am extending this provision as required on the basis of assessed needs.</P>
      <P>Since September 1999, the remedial teacher service has been extended to every first and second level school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. Schools with lower ratios have been advised that they may apply to my Department for a remedial service where they can demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
      <P>In addition, a national educational psychological service has now been established and this service will be expanded over the next five years to ensure that adequate assessment services are available to all children with special needs.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education and Science, it is my intention to continue to build on the these developments and to ensure that all special needs children receive the support they require to enable them to reach their potential within the education system.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that about 10% of Irish pupils at primary level have serious literacy problems arising from various causes. It is recognised that a small percentage of pupils among those have a specific reading disability or dyslexia. Reading difficulties, including dyslexia, should be identified as early as possible in the primary school. My Department has allocated 1,465 remedial teachers and approximately 300 resource teachers at primary level to support pupils with learning difficulties, including those with dyslexia.</P>
      <P>Students undertaking the bachelor of education degree or the graduate diploma in education now follow a course module on special education which covers issues such as reading difficulties and dyslexia. Remedial and resource teachers have access to specific courses which equip them to work with pupils who present with learning difficulties. I am arranging for all schools to be supplied with the Drumcondra English profiles and standardised reading tests to assist in monitoring pupil progress and in the early detection and diagnosis of learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>It is the function of class teachers to detect signs of reading difficulty and it is the function of remedial and resource teachers to diagnose the exact nature of each child's learning difficulty. Where dyslexia is suspected, assessment by a psychologist is required.</P>
      <P>It is considered that the present practice of identification and diagnosis of literacy difficulties by pupils, teachers and by psychologists assigned to schools, is the most effective way of ensuring timely and appropriate interventions for pupils with literacy difficulties, including those with dyslexia.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the national child care census which is being carried <Col N="947" /> out on by Area Development Management Limited which activities fall within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is acknowledged that there is a need for baseline data on the availability of child care throughout the country in order to be able to plan and develop services over the seven years of the national development plan. I understand that the following is the position in relation to the census.</P>
      <P>The project involved a census of group based child care facilities which will provide information in relation to child population, the level of supply of such facilities, the availability of child care places in such facilities and the likely future demand for such services on a county to county basis. It will also provide data for analysis in relation to future planning of child care supports. The collection of data has been completed in most counties at this stage and the county reports are being finished. National reports arising from the census will be published later this year. It is intended to launch the first county reports at the forthcoming childcare conference in Killarney on 8-9 May 2000.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been given responsibility for co-ordinating child care service delivery over the course of the national development plan. This involves the establishment of national and local structures to include the key players in the future development of child care. The structures include: an inter-departmental committee to focus on co-operation and co-ordination on policy issues, including early childhood education, between Departments and State agencies with a role in child care. The national child care census will provide valuable information on the provision of child care in this context; a national co-ordinating child care committee to oversee the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country and county child care committees to advance child care service provision at local levels. Membership will comprise local representatives of the statutory and non-statutory sectors including parents.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that these structures, together with the national child care census and database, will provide a forum for consultation and sharing of information on development of the child care sector.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the census will also be relevant in the context of the implementation of Ready to Learn, the White Paper on Early Education published by my Department recently. Planning for implementation of the White Paper's proposals is currently in progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>School development planning is specifically mentioned in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness as a measure to improve the quality of education and the Education Act, 1998, requires each school to have a school plan.</P>
      <P>The process of school development planning is, by its nature, ongoing. Many schools at primary and second level have been engaged in school development planning for some time and are at various stages in the developmental process. A considerable number of schools have a plan in place or are in the process of refining-revising various elements of their plan. There has been a strong tradition of school development planning in the primary sector for over twenty years and experience of school evaluations indicates that the vast majority of schools have documented various aspects of curriculum and school policies as part of a school plan.</P>
      <P>My Department published comprehensive development planning guidelines for primary schools last summer in order to provide a uniform template for drawing up a school plan. These guidelines were developed in close consultation with the education partners and circulated to all primary schools.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;School Development Planning  &ndash; An Introduction for Second Level Schools&rdquo; was also prepared by my Department, in consultation with the partners in education and circulated to all second level schools in September 1999. More detailed guidelines for second level schools will be issued by September 2001 following a school planning development project being undertaken at present by 130 schools.</P>
      <P>I have allocated £5 million as part of a school development planning initiative between 1999-2002 to assist schools in the school development planning, SDP, process. A key element of the initiative is the availability of SDP facilitators, 44 at primary level and 78 at second level, to work with schools in formulating aspects of their school plans.</P>
      <P>All schools serving disadvantaged areas at both primary and second level have been targeted for help initially as part of the school development planning initiative.</P>
      <P>At primary level 442 such schools received grants from £300 to £750 to assist them in the process and up to two days facilitation for school planning were available to these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level 276 schools, including all schools serving disadvantaged areas, have been grant aided with grants varying from £1,000 to £2,000. The trained facilitators are working intensively with 130 of the 276 schools in a school planning development project to finalise SDP guidelines for all second level schools. These will be <Col N="949" /> published by September 2001. It is intended that all remaining 486 second level schools will be assisted over the next three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that significant progress has been made regarding the implementation of relationships and sexuality education in schools.</P>
      <P>As I indicated recently in reply to a similar question, April 1999 is the latest date for which figures are available regarding levels implementation of relationship and sexuality education, RSE, in primary and post-primary schools. Based on a 66% response rate from primary schools and 64% from post-primary schools the data, collected in late 1998, indicated that 24% of respondent primary schools were already implementing an RSE programme and 57% indicated an intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the 1998-99 school year. Some 67% of respondent post-primary schools are already implementing RSE in some or all classes and 78% indicated their intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the school year. A follow-up survey is currently under way, and I expect the results to be available shortly.</P>
      <P>The RSE training support service, which is funded by the in-career development unit of my Department, acts as a support to schools in this work. It continues to organise information seminars for parents and for boards of management of schools, policy development seminars for school-based committees, whole school staff seminars and the production of resource materials for teachers. In this respect, senior cycle resource materials issued to schools in September 1999 and the final set of materials for fifth and sixth classes at primary level have also been issued. I expect that all of these activities are having a positive influence on the levels of implementation of RSE in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the timeframe within which all schools will be implementing an RSE programme, it is not possible to be definitive in this matter. I recognise that schools are at different stages of implementation and that for many the policy formulation process, which involves school management, parents and teachers working collaboratively, is a relatively new experience. Feedback from schools has indicated that this process has been extremely valuable for all concerned and I am confident that the range of supports <Col N="950" /> being made available to schools will speed up the process of implementation.</P>
    <P>I believe we need to continue our efforts to ensure that all children have access at the earliest possible stage to an RSE programme which enables them learn about their own development and about their friendships and relationships with others.</P>

    <P>My Department also advised the task forces that any educational issues of particular concern in a task force area, which could not be adequately resolved through this representation process, could be referred to my Department through the education co-ordinator.

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of measures were introduced by this Government to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education was increased substantially in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total projected intake in the 1999-2000 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers shall graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>

My Department will make offers of appointment to successful candidates in the near future.</P>
      <P>My Department expects to be in a position to appoint up to 50 additional psychologists during the current year, which will double the present number of psychologists in the National Educational Psychological Service Agency.</P>
      <P>The planning group set up by my Department in 1997 to examine the level of need for the educational psychological service and to make recommendations for the future, recommended that 200 psychologists would be required to provide a psychological service to all schools. As recommended in the report of the planning group, it is envisaged that there will be a fully operational psychological service to all schools at the end of a five-year development phase, that is, by the end of the year 2004.</P>

      <P>The projects strand of the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative seeks to develop models of intervention that are effective in addressing the needs of young people who are risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Also, the models must be replicable in areas other than those areas in which they operate as pilot projects.</P>
      <P>The core element of the initiative is the establishment of multi-agency consortia at local level that deliver in-school and out-of-school supports to young people at risk and to their families. The consortia must involve a school or schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 1,200 young people are specifically targeted for direct support in the project areas. <Col N="954" /> Based on criteria developed at local level, these young people are deemed to be most at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system and of leaving school without qualification. Additional numbers of young people who are potentially at risk, and others, are involved in out-of-school developmental activities.</P>
    <P>All the young people in the projects are involved in holiday time activities that include more academic supports, social and personal development, sport and leisure activities as well as other actions that ensure a safe and motivated return to school.</P>

      <P>I am indeed aware of the findings of the recent study undertaken by ICTU on second level students working during the school term.</P>
      <P>My Department welcomes and fosters the development of school-industry links particularly at senior cycle and promotes work experience within the transition year programme, leaving certificate applied and vocational programmes. However, it is a matter for each school following dialogue between the school, parents and local employers on how best they should deal with part-time working by second level pupils. I am aware that many schools have proactive policies to encourage young people, particularly those in their final leaving certificate year, not to engage in part-time work or, if such must be done, to the minimum level possible. I welcome and endorse such policies. Many schools have dialogued with employers, particularly in the service industries, to discourage and to control the level of involvement of second level pupils in part-time work. However, parents have a major influence on their children and they are best able to control the level of part-time work by their children.</P>

      <P>The substance misuse prevention education programme, Walk Tall, for primary schools <Col N="955" /> was developed by my Department in consultation with the partners in education and other relevant interests and its use was pilot tested in a small number of primary schools prior to the end of 1998. The dissemination of the programme to primary schools began in early 1999.</P>
      <P>The programme is being introduced to schools as staff seminars are organised for the teachers in each school. Walk Tall has been introduced to approximately 1,870 primary schools now. The intention is to introduce the programme to all primary schools over a two year period. The progress of the dissemination will be further reviewed in mid-May.</P>
      <P>In addition to the one-day seminars for school staffs, courses for teachers of 30 hours duration on implementing the programme have commenced. Twenty-seven of these courses have been, or are being held at present. It is intended that this training will be integrated in due course with the in-service support to be provided for the introduction of social, personal and health education, SPHE, as part of the revised curriculum for primary schools.</P>
      <P>A support team has been put in place for the dissemination process. This team consists of a national project officer and six teacher trainers. The team organises the staff training seminars and the longer courses. The administrative support for the dissemination is located in West Dublin Education Centre.</P>
      <P>The financial support for the introduction of Walk Tall was £0.5 million in 1999 and a further £0.5 million is provided this year. The supporting educational resource materials are provided free to schools as they participate in the dissemination seminars. The overall cost of preparation, design and printing of these materials was £142,000.</P>

      <P>One of my key objectives in visiting the United States was to learn about the approaches adopted within the US education system to cater for children with special educational needs, both in integrated settings and in special dedicated facilities. During my visit, I had an opportunity to visit a number of schools catering for children with special needs and to see the US system at work. As is the case when I visit our own education facilities, I was struck by the particular level of dedication and commitment shown by staff catering for the special needs children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> A particularly striking feature of the US system is the sheer volume of research which is being conducted across a range of special needs areas and the level of debate which continues to arise around issues such as the appropriate educational response for children with autism; attention deficit disorder and specific learning disabilities including dyslexia. Indeed, I was interested to note that the issues and difficulties with which the Irish education system is currently confronted in special needs areas have also arisen in the US system.</P>
    <P>My visit to the US was part of a series of ongoing contacts which have developed at ministerial and official level between the Irish and US Departments of Education in recent years. Arising from my visit, arrangements are being finalised for the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the US authorities in June of this year. This memorandum will focus in particular on issues relating to special education services and will allow Ireland the facility of accessing the substantial body of research into special education areas which has already been conducted in the US. It will also allow us to participate with the US authorities in further research projects in special needs areas. Also, as a result of my recent visit, arrangements will be made to facilitate teacher exchanges between Ireland and the US with a particular focus on teachers involved in the delivery of special education services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there has been a gradual increase in the level of car ownership among the under 30s in recent years. The Irish Insurance Federation inform me that while there are no statistics available yet for 1998 or 1999, it is estimated that in 1997 approximately 142,000 people under the age of 30 took out compulsory motor insurance in their own name. The average pre<Col N="958" /> mium for this category of driver at that time was approximately £715.</P>
      <P>The cost of motor insurance for the driver in his or her twenties is reflective of the difficulties being experienced by young people in securing motor insurance and, indeed, the high cost of compulsory motor insurance cover. I understand this situation is directly attributable to the adverse claims experience of young, especially male, drivers as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the average cost of an insurance claim for young drivers is twice that for the more mature motorist and that the former are responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the more mature age group.</P>
      <P>My re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was a major initiative aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The board, whose expanded membership includes a member representing young drivers' interests, has undertaken an ambitious programme of work and research, particularly in relation to the basis of charges to young drivers.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>

      <P>I have had no discussions with IBEC on this issue and am not aware of any companies using the introduction of the national minimum wage to increase prices. It is a matter for each individual company to decide what prices to charge.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that I was able to honour the Government's commitment to introduce a national minimum wage which, it is estimated by the ESRI, will benefit 163,000 employees.

      <P>The interdepartmental working group, to which the Deputy refers, was set up on 26 March 1999 by my predecessor to consider the issue of possible regulation of adventure activities. The group presented its report on 4 June 1999 with a number of recommendations, including the establishment of a statutory authority with responsibility for drawing-up safety guidelines or codes for prescribed providers of adventure centres and for enforcing those guidelines.</P>
      <P>In July 1999, the Government accepted in principle that there was a need for a statutory regime to regulate safety in adventure centres, that the development of this regime be progressed by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and that procedures be put in train to establish a new unit within the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to deal with marine leisure and tourism, including this issue. My Department is currently working on the proposed legislation, the introduction of which is part of the Government's legislative programme for 2000.</P>
      <P>In the interim, a grant of £30,000 was paid to the Association for Adventure Sports &ndash; AFAS &ndash; in August 1999 to enhance and extend the Centre Standards Board &ndash; CSB &ndash; scheme of inspection of providers' facilities and to consult with a view to drawing up a blueprint for an inspection scheme which the new statutory authority could base its operations when established. I expect to receive this blueprint after a specially convened conference, being organised as part of the AFAS consultative process to debate this issue, has taken place in Dublin on 4 May 2000.</P>

      <P>I note from the correspondence supplied that the only issue in which I have a specific function relates to the question of accessibility to public transport for people with disabilities. I propose to confine my answer to this matter.</P>
      <P>It is my policy that all transport operators, and in particular State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them.</P>
      <P>As already announced in the National Development Plan 2000-06 all new and upgraded rail and bus stations financed under the plan will be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people; all light rail vehicles and suburban railcars financed under the plan will also be accessible to mobility impaired and disabled people and all buses purchased by CIE from 2000 for use on urban services will be low floor.</P>
      <P>All DART carriages are already accessible, as are the diesel railcars used on the suburban services. Iarnród Éireann is taking delivery of a further 26 DART carriages and 20 diesel railcars this year which will also be accessible. Wheelchair space is provided in the dining car areas of other passenger trains and, where advance notice of group travel is received, additional wheelchair space can be created.</P>
      <P>Bus Átha Cliath has approximately 30 low floor accessible buses currently in operation with a further 225 such buses on order for delivery this year.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann has 44 low floor accessible buses in operation and a further 66 such buses are on order for delivery later this year. The company is continuing to monitor developments in relation to coach design and manufacture which would improve Bus Éireann's capacity to meet the needs of people with mobility impairments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among other things, the national development plan provides for the establishment of a public <Col N="964" /> transport accessibility committee to advise me on the accessibility of public transport for mobility impaired and disabled people. Included in the plan is a special provision of £10 million to part finance accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities. The committee, which will be convened shortly, will advise me on particular projects which could be funded from this allocation.</P>

    <P>*This particular category has not in fact been recruited for some years.</P>
    <P>From time to time, occasional direct entry competitions may be held to recruit personnel with specialist qualifications for the Naval Service. The director of the Army Medical Corps advises on the eye sight requirements for such personnel. In some such cases, corrective lenses may be acceptable, depending on the nature of the appointment.</P>
    <P>However, a person who has undergone surgical correction of visual acuity cannot be accepted for entry to the Naval Service. All entrants must be free from squint or latent squint and must be free from chronic ocular disease. In those cases where eyesight must meet the required standard without the aid of corrective lenses, I understand this criterion anticipates a situation where personnel would be, or might be likely to be, engaged in duties where sudden and unforeseen loss of lenses could occur in circumstances which would be crucially detrimental to performance, thereby <Col N="965" /> endangering either that person, or others, or preventing the proper carrying out of duties.</P>

My Department contacted the herdowner to clarify the matter some time ago, but so far no response has been received. No payments can issue until this matter has been resolved.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 112 of 24 February 2000, the person named claimed a total of 19.54 hectares on his 1999 area aid application.

      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887-92, when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore, in this case as the overclaim is greater than 20%, no area aid related payments can issue in respect of 1999.</P>

      <P>The penalty to which the Deputy refers is one of a number introduced in 1999 for different specified contraventions of the rural environmental protection scheme. Prior to the introduction of this detailed schedule, the range of penalties available to the Department in enforcing the obligations of REPS participants was restricted, and the consequences of non-compliance could in some cases be disproportionate. Over or under-declaration of area, for example, could previously attract disqualification as opposed to the present reduction of 50% in one annual payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> The contravention itself is a serious one and the level of penalty is therefore justified. As REPS is an area-based scheme, over-declaration could result in participants receiving payments to which they were not entitled. Under-declaration, on the other hand, could mean that an applicant was not meeting or was seeking to evade his or her obligation to farm the entire holding in accordance with the agri-environmental plan submitted, which is an essential component of the scheme.</P>
    <P>To date, the penalty to which the Deputy refers has been imposed in some 170 cases in 16 counties, including both the counties referred to. A number of these cases are at present under appeal.</P>
    <P>In overall terms the penalty regime forms an essential control in ensuring compliance with EU requirements.</P>

Some 15 million gallons will be allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquiring additional quota. A further five million gallons will be allocated to younger dairy farmers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons who have shown similar commitment. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Charges have always been a feature of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. Under section 47 of the Act, public bodies are obliged to charge a requester in respect of the grant of an FOI request unless the cost of collecting and accounting for the fee would outweigh the fee itself. The principal charges currently in operation are £16.50 per hour for search and retrieval of records and 3p per copy of a record made. Therefore there is no question of &ldquo;introducing&rdquo; a charge for FOI requests.</P>
      <P>There are important circumstances where charges do not apply. For example, where records contain personal information relating to the requester, a fee must be disregarded by the public body unless the request encompasses a significant number of records. Furthermore, the Act allows a public body to waive all or part of a fee after having regard to the means of the requester. Also, under section 47(8)(a), a requester may ask the public body to specify the amendments, if any, to the request which would have the effect of reducing or eliminating the fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain changes to the existing charges regime are being examined in my Department following a report undertaken by the network of civil service users of the FOI Act. That report recommended a number of changes to the existing charges regime aimed primarily at curbing flagrant abuses of the Act and at allowing the Act operate more efficiently and effectively. It should be emphasised that the report's recommendations in this area are aimed at improving the operation of the Act from the point of view of both requester and public body. It should also be <Col N="970" /> emphasised that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, made a particular point in a recent statement he made to the Seanad of saying that he did not favour a basic small fee for persons seeking access to their own records or for Oireachtas Members and that he felt it would be appropriate to offset any up-front fee with an allowance for, say, up to two hours search and retrieval time for free.</P>
    <P>No firm conclusions have been reached as yet on charges or other areas of the FOI Act and its operation that have been identified for improvement. The intention has been to consider these matters in depth and to listen to the views of Oireachtas members and others before making or proposing changes. The Minister of State has met with the relevant Oireachtas committees to discuss the civil service users network report. I think that Minister of State's Seanad statement of 6 April 2000 is a useful exposition of the current position on FOI and I have arranged that a copy be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Stamp duty rates for residential property were reduced significantly by the Government as part of the package of taxation measures in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998 arising out of the Bacon report on house prices. This reduction in stamp duty rates has been of benefit to all house purchasers, including first time buyers of second hand houses.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report considered that reductions in stamp duty on all residential property would lead to additional turnover in the second hand house market thus increasing the range of housing available to first-time buyers. Reducing stamp duty on residential property in this way has made the second hand house market more accessible for first-time purchasers.</P>
      <P>At that time the introduction of a specific exemption or relief for first-time buyers was considered. However, given the significant estimated costs involved, any specific exemption for first-time buyers would have prevented a reduction in the rates for residential property generally.</P>
      <P>For these reasons the Government considered that reductions in the stamp duty rates applicable to all residential property, as recommended in the Bacon report, would be more beneficial to first-time buyers and the housing market in general than a specific total exemption aimed at first-time buyers only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stamp duty yield statistics available do not distinguish between first time buyers and other buyers. In the case of second hand houses, the Revenue Commissioners have estimated that the <Col N="971" /> cost to the Exchequer of eliminating stamp duty for first time buyers of second hand houses would be of the order of £50 million or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the EU sixth VAT directive member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates. A rebate scheme on the lines suggested by the Deputy would effectively be zero rating and be contrary to EU VAT Law. The approximate cost of the proposal by the Deputy based on an estimate of new housing and apartments constructed in 1999 is in the order of £550 million. Even if it was feasible, it is doubtful whether such a scheme would reduce house prices. Given current market circumstances, a market rebate would soon be capitalised through an increase in the house price level.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, according to the information available to the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer will not have an income tax liability in the current tax year as his total income is less than the exemption limit of £15,000 which applies to married taxpayers aged 65 and over.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that where a person is in receipt of taxable payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, such as old age pension, the payments are made without tax being deducted. In order to collect the tax due on such payments, it is necessary to reduce the recipient's tax-free allowances by an amount equal to the payments he or she receives. In this case, when the taxpayer's estimated social welfare income is deducted from the exemption limit figure, his remaining tax-free allowance is higher than his other taxable income. Consequently no liability to tax arises.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer is financially better off under the exemption limit rules than if he were to avail of the tax-free allowances appropriate to a taxpayer of his age, marital status etc. Under the exemption limit rules, he does not have to pay income tax. Under the tax-free allowances system, he would have an income tax liability of approximately £260.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, is a matter for its board of management.  Staff of the IBTS are located at three centres, namely, Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Additional staff will be located at two new mobile blood collection centres which are being established in Carlow and Ardee, County Louth.</P>
      <P>The board's objective is to develop a national cohesive organisation which meets the needs of the hospital services effectively and efficiently. This objective is based on the findings of a number of reports including the report of the expert group on the BTSB, the Bain report and the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB, Finlay Report. The board has recently reviewed progress to date in achieving this key objective and considers that further action is now required. This is particularly the case given the establishment of two additional mobile centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board fully recognises the importance of the participation of staff in the ongoing develop<Col N="977" /> ment of the organisation and in improving services for hospitals throughout the country. A consultative process has commenced which is being managed on a collaborative basis involving staff on a functional, such as medical, technical, nursing and donor services, rather than a traditional geographic basis. The board considers that all staff should fully engage in this process in the interests of the organisation as a whole. The board is also developing a revised committee-team structure which will ensure appropriate and ongoing involvement of staff in the planning and implementation of board policy. The question of autonomy for any element of its service on a geographic basis would be in conflict with the board's own reorganisation strategy, undermine the governance function of the board and the corporate responsibilities of the chief executive officer and national medical director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment of a subvention under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is aimed at providing assistance towards the cost of private nursing home fees and is not intended to meet the full cost of nursing home care.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the scheme has increased from £4 million in 1993, when the scheme was introduced, to £38.4 million in 2000. An increase in the maximum rate of subvention from £120 per week to £200 per week would represent an increase in the region of 67%. An increase in subvention rates, generally, of 67% would cost at least £25.73 million per annum. However, account also has to be taken of the fact that many subventions are abated by reference to the means of the applicant; the increase in these cases could be in excess of 67% and this would mean that the total cost of the increase would be greater than £25.73 million per annum. In order to ascertain an accurate figure, the case of each individual in receipt of subvention would have to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's priority this year is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands on the scheme. I am keeping under review the scope that exists for effecting further improvements in terms of the scheme. Any increase in the rates of subvention will depend on the availability of resources and will take cognisance of the need for <Col N="984" /> further improvements in services for older people.</P>

      <P>In 1999, £1 million was allocated to health boards specifically for the support of carers and it was used to benefit carers in a flexible manner based on local needs. This funding was used to develop additional services for carers, including day care, respite care and home support services. Assistance was also provided to aid the setting up of carer support groups and to improve training for carers. Co-ordinators/liaison officers were appointed to assist with the development and support of carers. Some £800,000 was allocated to the boards to recruit more paramedical and nursing staff who were assigned to the home care of older people which, in turn, also assisted carers. These initiatives have been continued this year with a further £1 million provided specifically for the support of carers and £780,000 to improve community supports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to state precisely the cost of extending the medical card to all persons over the age of 66 years. However, recent estimates relating to persons aged 65 years and over put the estimated cost at about £27 million. This figure does not take account of the costs of other health and social services which may be made available without charge to medical card holders. Loss of income from public hospital statutory charges, from which medical holders are exempt, would also have to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a <Col N="985" /> three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, increased by one third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.</P>

      <P>While I am not aware of the difficulties mentioned by the Deputy, I expect that litter surveys this year to be undertaken by local authorities under the national litter pollution monitoring system will quantify the scale of the problem of dog fouling.</P>
      <P>The national anti-litter forum, which was established last July, is reviewing a wide range of issues associated with litter pollution, including the legislative framework in this area, and is due to report shortly with proposals for additional anti-litter measures. The forum recommendations, including any relating to legislation, will be given detailed consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>The development and sale of houses in phases is a long established practice which may be justified especially in large-scale developments. However, in a number of instances in recent years problems have arisen due to uncertainty about the number of houses and the price <Col N="987" /> at which they are being made available under a particular phase of a housing development.</P>
      <P>This issue was highlighted by the Law Reform Commission in its report on gazumping, which recommended the enactment of legislation regulating the advertisement of the sale of houses in new housing developments. The commission recommended that advertisements should specify the number of houses for sale at each price level and the period for which those prices are fixed. The report is being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has overall responsibility for consumer protection issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully committed to removing the disadvantages and discriminations suffered by people with disabilities in so far as they relate to functions under my control. The following are some of the key measures which I have taken to this end.</P>
      <P>Part M of the building regulations, which came into effect on 1 June 1992, applies to the construction of new public buildings and the reconstruction of existing public buildings. I published a consultation document in July 1999 on proposals relating to the amendment of Part M to make all new housing visitable by people with disabilities. This consultation process also included a full review of Part M and its associated technical guidance document. My Department has now completed the review of the submissions received in consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Body. I hope to issue the revised Part M shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing provided by the voluntary sector under the capital assistance scheme is targeted at the needs of specific groups such as disabled persons, the elderly and the homeless with whom the voluntary sector have a long history of working successfully. The assistance available to voluntary bodies under the scheme has recently been substantially increased, including for the first time, the provision of funding for site acquisition. The funding required to significantly increase output from the voluntary sector over the coming years to meet the Government's target of 4,000 units per annum has been included in the national <Col N="990" /> development plan. This increased provision of voluntary housing will improve access to social housing for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also provide housing for people with disabilities. At the end of 1998, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were over 3,400 local authority houses reserved or adapted for people with disabilities. The expansion of the local authority construction programme under the national development plan will increase the availability of social housing for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>An access officer has been appointed in each county and county borough and assigned the function of co-ordinating and promoting access activities in his/her county or city.</P>
    <P>Local licensing authorities are empowered to determine the number of taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi licences which may be granted in their functional areas, to monitor the adequacy of the taxi and wheelchair accessible taxi service in their areas and to decide on action to ensure that the demand for those services is adequately met. In Dublin, for example, a total of 800 wheelchair accessible taxi licences have been granted since 1992.</P>
    <P>The recent Government initiative to increase Dublin taxi licence numbers, currently the subject of High Court proceedings, includes provision for 500 additional wheelchair accessible taxi licences.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, introduced a number of significant changes in relation to the application of traffic and parking laws to disabled persons. These regulations provided for a new type of disabled persons parking permit which can be issued by local authorities, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association. The new permits are available to any person who is suffering from a disability that prevents that person from walking or causes undue hardship to the person walking.</P>
    <P>In addition, local authorities are empowered to provide disabled persons parking bays on public roads in their charge and all wheelchair users, including users of mechanically propelled wheelchairs, may use cycle tracks.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, empowers road authorities to make by-laws governing the type of paid parking controls to be applied on public roads in their functional areas, including the exemption of specified classes of vehicles from the payment of fees in respect of parking, the conditions under which specified classes of vehicles may be so exempted and the identification of exempted vehicles.</P>
    <P>Since October 1997 the offence of parking illegally in a disabled person's parking bay comes within the scope of the on-the-spot fines system which applies countrywide.</P>
    <P>The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in their area is a matter for each local authority as is the selection and prioritisation of projects for funding. The Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads <Col N="991" /> states in a section entitled Facilitation of Persons with Disabilities:</P>
    <P>Local Authorities are urged, when planning and executing road works and particularly the planning and designing of pedestrian facilities to pay particular attention to the needs of the mobility impaired, including the visually impaired. Care should be taken to avoid steep or irregular gradients or sharp changes in the alignment of footpaths which might prove deceptive to blind or partially sighted persons. Kerbs should be dished and wheelchair ramps, constructed of non-slip material, should be provided at pedestrian crossing points, where possible. The potential danger represented by road works can be particularly acute in the case of blind or partially &ndash; sighted persons and special care should be taken to ensure their safety. Local representatives of persons with disabilities should be consulted, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The provision of dished and tactile paving on pavements and the provision of smooth paths are a matter for local authorities. The 1999 allocation to urban authorities included for the first time a special block grant of £4.2 million which had to be devoted to footpath and carriageway restoration. This special block grant has been continued in 2000 and £6.25 million has been provided for such works in 2000.</P>
    <P>For the first time, a regional traffic management grants scheme was introduced in 2000 for the county boroughs of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, similar works are carried out in Dublin city under auspices of the Dublin transportation office. A sum of £1.5 million has been provided for such schemes in 2000. The local authorities involved were requested to submit by 3 March 2000 the work programme they intend to carry out. There are ten categories of eligible works under the regional traffic management grants scheme and one of these is &ldquo;improved pedestrian facilities, i.e. dished kerbs, tactile paving and audio signals at pedestrian crossings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities was published by me and was issued by my Department to all local authorities in July 1999. The code covers issues such as recruitment, integration into the workplace, career development, retention in employment, accommodation and equipment, safety, health and welfare at work and evacuation procedures.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities, and as a further initiative to focus attention on disability issues, I invited local authority political leaders, managers, equality officers and disability officers as well as representatives of organisations for people with disabilities to attend a disability awareness seminar in Dublin Castle on 28 September 1999.</P>

      <P>Last December's social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to over £428 million on a full year basis, provides,<i> inter alia,</i> for a £4 a week increase in social welfare payments in general, including disability allowance. With an expected annual average inflation rate of 3% for 2000, this year's increases will be ahead of expected inflation, representing a real increase of 2.3% for recipients of disability allowance.</P>
      <P>In addition, special increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances are being provided as part of an overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate over the next three budgets. This means that the couple rate of disability allowance will increase by £7.80 a week, 6.7%, which represents a real increase of 3.6%.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, these increases are being paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increases in the weekly rates of social welfare payments, last December's budget also provided for a number of other improvements for people with disabilities, including the payment of full-rate disability allowance to those in full-time residential care, which will result in an increase of £40.70 a week in such cases, and a 50% increase from £50 to £75 a week in the amount of income from rehabilitative employment which is disregarded for disability allowance purposes. This enhanced disregard has also been extended to those in rehabilitative  self-employment. Finally, it should be noted that the recently ratified Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that over the next three years all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 a week for the lower rates of payment.</P>

      <P>The manager of the Department's branch office in Kildare retired recently. In the normal course, when a branch manager retires the question arises as to the nature of the replacement service that will be required to meet the needs of the people living in the area. If it is decided to continue to have a branch office in the area, the branch office contract, which is in effect a franchise to provide services on behalf of the Department, would be re-let to the new appointee on the same basis as currently applies. Alternatively, the processing of claims could be taken into the parent local office and the branch office replaced by a service provided directly by Department staff geared to local needs.</P>
      <P>A decision in relation to Kildare will be made shortly. In the meantime, persons who are registered as unemployed at the branch office are being dealt with from the Newbridge social welfare local office. There is no question of any change in the system of payments to unemployed people because their payments are made at post offices and not at the branch office or local office concerned. The issue raised by the Deputy in relation to people having to queue for payments will be raised with An Post who will be asked to reply directly to the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of social welfare legislation, the social insurance status of spouses engaged in a family business varies with the circumstances of the case. A number of different situations can arise. First, spouses who are engaged in a business partnership are treated as individual self employed contributors. Both make social insurance contributions and will be eligible, in due course, to qualify individually and in their own right for social insurance pensions, including an old age contributory pension. While there are specific requirements in company law regarding business partnerships there is no <Col N="994" /> restriction on married couples operating under such partnership arrangements.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, where a family business is incorporated as a limited company, spouses involved in the business pay PRSI as either employees of the company or as self-employed persons, if they are the proprietary directors of that company.</P>
      <P>However, the legislation also provides that a person who is employed directly by his/her spouse is not covered by social insurance. Social insurance contributions are not due and the employed spouse is not covered for social insurance pensions. Likewise, if a spouse participates in the business of a self-employed contributor, but is not a partner in the business, social insurance contributions are not due and the participating or assisting spouse is not covered for social insurance pensions or benefits.</P>
      <P>Any person who wishes to seek a formal decision as to whether an employment or self employment is insurable for social insurance purposes should apply to scope section of my Department. Where a person is dissatisfied with the relevant decision there is a right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>As regards contributions, a number of arrangements are already in place which cater for the position of persons who are no longer compulsorily covered by social insurance. Former contributors can opt, subject to certain conditions, to make voluntary contributions. In general, voluntary contributions give cover for the pensions which people were covered for when last working as an employee or a self employed person and thereby enable such persons to maintain social insurance cover.</P>
      <P>There are also special arrangements available for homemakers which enable persons who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From April 1994, contribution years spent out of the workforce caring for children up to the age of six, increased to 12 from April 1995, or incapacitated persons may be disregarded for the purpose of determining the minimum yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years can be disregarded in this way.</P>
      <P>My Department will be, during the course of this year, examining the current arrangements applying to the social insurance position of spouses engaged in a family business. I will be giving detailed consideration to the outcome of that examination and, if appropriate, I will bring forward legislative changes in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the 1970s the qualifying age for old age pensions was age 70. In 1970, the retirement pension was introduced for contributors who retired at age 65. Eligibility for this pension is conditional on being fully retired from employment and/or self-employment. A person is regarded as being retired if his/her earnings from (a) employment are less than £30 per week and (b) self-employment are less than £2,500 per annum.</P>
      <P>In the period 1973 to 1975 the age at which a person became eligible for old age pensions, whether contributory or non-contributory, was progressively reduced from age 70 to age 66. Consequently, the retirement condition under the retirement pension scheme referred to above only applies for one year, that is from age 65 to 66.</P>
      <P>While there are no plans to increase the earnings thresholds, which are linked to these for insurability under the PRSI system, the position will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Originally the deserted wife's allowance &ndash; DWA &ndash; was available to women with qualified children or to those without qualified children who were over 40 years of age. Similar provisions applied to the deserted wife's benefit &ndash; DWB. The schemes were designed to ensure that payment were made only to mothers and to those likely because of age to find it difficult to obtain employment.</P>
      <P>On the introduction of the lone parent's allowance &ndash; LPA &ndash; in 1990 newly separated women with qualified children, who did not have a contributory based entitlement, were directed to the new scheme as were those with children who had been receiving DWA. The DWB scheme remained unchanged at that time. The DWA scheme remained open to women over 40 years of age without dependent children until January 1997 when it and DWB were closed to new applicants. Those who were receiving these payments at the time remain on these as long as they continue to satisfy the qualifying conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From January 1997, the Department's main income support measure for lone parents, including separated people, is the one-parent family payment &ndash; OFP. The payment is aimed exclusively at those with qualified children and there is <Col N="996" /> no facility to continue payment when there are no qualified children remaining in a household. One of the objectives of the scheme is to discourage long-term welfare dependency by facilitating lone parents to take up employment and/or training. The income disregard of £115.38 per week which applies to the OFP means test is the main element of this policy.</P>
    <P>People who lost entitlement to DWB because they were under 40 years of age and no longer had qualified children may still return to the scheme when they reach age 40. This facility was extended in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, to former DWA recipients who were transferred to LPA in 1990 and then to OFP in 1997. The current arrangements are considered sufficiently flexible.</P>

      <P>Any such reductions would have major financial implications, and in view of future demographic projections, would only serve to increase pressure on future pensions funding and provision.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance, to carers of people in receipt of prescribed relatives and constant attendance allowance and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other free schemes are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities <Col N="997" /> under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement provided that prior to the death of the spouse or partner, the couple were permanently residing together. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published by the policy institute, Trinity College Dublin, and launched by me last week. The review estimates that the cost of extending the free schemes to all widows and widowers regardless of age, income or household composition would be in the region of £28 million per annum and the cost of extending these to all widows and widowers over age 60 would be in the region of £20 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The review notes that widows and widowers do not have the type of needs which require the same type of targeting as older people or people with disabilities and for this reason, it does not recommend that the free schemes be extended further for this category.</P>
    <P>The review considers that the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
    <P>The review put forward 12 priority proposals for consideration. I am pleased to say that I have already implemented two of these proposals in budget 2000. These extend the free schemes to all people aged over 75 regardless of income and household composition and also to carers in receipt of the carer's allowance. In addition, I have provided in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, that the cost of the schemes will be funded from the social insurance fund for those in receipt of contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>I also intend to move towards the establishment of a single household benefits scheme in future budgets. This will amalgamate the existing separate free schemes administered by my Department into a single household benefits scheme with a streamlined application process.</P>
    <P>The report examines a large number of issues and requires detailed consideration. I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in this report in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The position as outlined in my reply to Question No. 638 of 26 January 2000 remains broadly unchanged. South Dublin County Council has already executed the legal transfer documents in respect of the portion of the demesne in South Dublin, the way is clear for Fingal County Council to complete the legal formalities as the issue of development funding has now been addressed and completion of the legal formalities transferring part of the demesne in Kildare to Kildare County Council is in train.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware significant expenditure is required to make Lucan Demesne fully accessible to the public and, accordingly, my Department sought and received approval from the Department of Finance for expenditure of £3.75 million on the development of the demesne over the next five years, commencing this year. This funding is not proportional to the areas of land within the respective boundaries of the three local authorities but, rather, will be allocated on the basis of an agreed programme of works.</P>
      <P>The sanction from the Department of Finance is subject to a maximum payment each year of £750,000 up to the end of 2004 and the three local authorities involved formally acknowledging that these payments represent the maximum amounts to be made available through my Department for the development of Lucan Demesne. This funding is also conditional upon the agreement of the local authorities to open as much of the demesne as possible to the public as early as possible for obvious reasons. To date I understand that only Kildare County Council has confirmed their agreement to these terms.</P>
      <P>My overriding concern is that the Lucan Demesne should be made available to the public as soon as possible and I would urge the two local authorities who have yet to confirm their acceptance of the conditions attached to the grant of development funding to do so, in order to facilitate commencement of the development works without delay.</P>

    <P>While I can inform the Deputy that the total number of crimes recorded in 1999, 81,274 was approximately 5% less than in 1998, 85,604, I am unable to provide figures on a divisional basis for 1999 yet as the figures are provisional and, as such, may be subject to change. The annual report of the Garda Síochána will, however, contain the final figures in respect of 1999 when it is published later in the year.</P>

      <P>In light of the urgent accommodation needs of asylum seekers, the Government decided on 28 March 2000 that mobile home accommodation be provided for asylum seekers in the former army barracks in Kildare. The decision was taken in the context of a package of urgent measures to deal with asylum, refugee and immigration matters, including the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers. There were no meetings at official level with local authorities or community groups in advance of the Government meeting.</P>
      <P>The number of asylum seekers entering the country has increased dramatically in recent years but particularly since July of last year. On the basis of recent trends, it is anticipated that between 12,000 and 15,000 persons will claim asylum in Ireland during 2000. It is against this background and the need to respond urgently to an emergency situation that the decisions taken by the Government last month arise.</P>
      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services, which was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department, is responsible,<i> inter alia,</i> for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. Since then the priority of the directorate has had to be the sourcing of accommodation on an urgent basis. The alternative, which is unacceptable, is to have asylum seekers sleeping on the streets and in parks.</P>
      <P>With effect from 10 April 2000, the directorate has taken over the allocation of all accommodation to asylum seekers. New structures and arrangements have been put in place which will facilitate both the preparation of asylum seekers and the provision of information to local communities. Under the new arrangements, asylum seekers will be accommodated at initial reception centres in Dublin for a period of one to two weeks for the purposes, <i>inter alia</i>, of needs assessment and processing of the initial stages of their asylum applications before being resettled at other locations around the country. The directorate recently took possession of three initial reception centres in Dublin. Meetings with local community representatives were arranged in each case prior to opening. From the week commencing 17 April, 2000 staff from the Directorate will be arranging and attending similar meetings at locations all around the country including Kildare where asylum seekers are to be resettled. On 4 April 2000, representatives from the directorate met a deputation of interests from Kildare in relation to the accommodation of asylum seekers at the former army barracks.</P>

Furthermore, I am informed that there are no statistics in relation to the number of prosecutions for using a mobile phone while driving.

    <P>Details of prosecutions in respect of 1999 are not yet published. However, the provisional statistics for speeding fines on the spot show that the gardaí issued in excess of 170,000 fines on the spot for speeding and, approximately, 25,000 tickets for seat belt offences. I have been assured by Garda authorities that Operation Lifesaver is being monitored constantly by the Garda National Traffic Bureau and where changes to enforcement tactics are deemed necessary they are introduced.</P>
    <P>The continuous enforcement of the traffic legislation and the full implementation of all the elements of the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety over the period 1998 to 2002 will, I believe, bring home to motorists the need to exercise greater care on the roads and to obey the traffic legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is a traffic corps in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement. The most recent figures show that there are 57 Sergeants and 374 Garda members of the Traffic Corps. In addition, all uniformed gardaí throughout the State are involved in traffic law enforcement as required. Also, there are 140 traffic wardens employed by the Garda Commissioner in the Dublin Metropolitan area who are responsible for the enforcement of the parking regulations. Outside the Dublin area traffic wardens are employed by local authorities under the Local Government (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a separate traffic corps independent of the Garda Siochana has been proposed from time to time. Although primary responsibility of the traffic corps is accident prevention and traffic control, members of the corps deal with all matters which require Garda attention.</P>
      <P>In addition to the traffic corps, in 1997, following a review of the Garda traffic operations, the Garda National Traffic Bureau, headed by a Chief Superintendent was established at Garda Headquarters to give greater focus and direction to Garda traffic law enforcement campaigns.</P>
      <P>I am of the view that the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps, independent of the Garda would not be as beneficial to the community as the existing arrangement which allows traffic corps members to deal with crime other than traffic related crime. If members of a separate traffic unit were to be given powers limited to road traffic matters, they would not be able to intervene in other police matters which come to their attention in the course of their duties.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should state that the deployment of gardaí to traffic functions is an operational decision which is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>In reply to the details supplied by the Deputy, two of the issues raised fall within the remit of my Department, namely, anti-discrimination legislation and the funding for Vantastic.</P>
      <P>Regarding anti-discrimination legislation, I have to date introduced three major legislative measures which between them establish a basis for equal opportunities and mainstreamed service provision for people with disabilities. These are: the Employment Equality Act, 1998; which prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine distinct grounds, including disability; the National Disability Authority Act, 1999, which is a key element in the policy of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities; and the Equal Status Bill, 1999, which will prohibit discrimination on the nine grounds specified in the equal employment enactment, including disability, in relation to the supply of goods and services.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, was brought into operation on 18 October, 1999 at which time the Equality Authority and the Office of Equality Investigations were established. Work on the establishment of the National Disability Authority under the National Disability Authority Act, 1999, is progressing within my Department and will become operational in the very near future. The Equal Status Bill, 1999 is expected to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas today and will then be sent to the President for signature.</P>
      <P>With regard to the funding for Vantastic, £350,000 is being provided by my Department this year for this organisation. This was a special provision announced in the context of the 2000 Budget statement.</P>
      <P>The other issues raised in the details supplied relate to accessibility to public housing and to public places which are matters for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; accessible public transport which is a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise; and personal assistance which is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children. I note that the Deputy has put down a similar question for answer by each of the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>No application for funding has been received from the pre-school concerned. My Department's involvement in the area of pre-school education is currently confined to the provision of infant classes in national schools and to support for a range of initiatives aimed at children who are disadvantaged and children who have special needs.</P>
      <P>Pre-school provision for the coming school year, other than infant classes in primary schools, will be as follows: early start pre-school pilot programme, catering for a maximum of 1,650 children; Rutland Street pre-school project, catering for up to 95 children; some 52 pre-schools for Travellers catering for up to 520 Traveller children; pilot pre-school provision for autistic children, catering for a maximum of 24 children.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, which was published recently sets out a blueprint for the development of the sector. The White Paper will build on existing provision and assist providers to raise quality of provision. Support will continue to be made available for infant classes in primary schools and for the initiatives outlined above. In addition, the State may become involved in further direct provision in certain instances, where the educational needs of the White Paper priority groups &ndash; disadvantaged children or children with special needs - are not being met by existing State-funded services.</P>
      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper, is currently under way in my Department. My officials are currently in discussion with parties involved in the early childhood education area with a view to implementing the White Paper proposals and establishing the necessary structures. This process will be concluded shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully recognise the importance of <Col N="1009" /> ensuring that teachers dealing with special needs children, including children with autism, receive the necessary training to enable them to address the special needs involved; my intention is that this will be the case.</P>
      <P>At the level of pre-service training, the existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs.</P>
      <P>Review groups were set up in 1999 in my Department to examine pre-service teacher education programmes for primary and post-primary teachers. The group for each area is required to have regard to developments in relation to catering for children with special needs. The reports of both groups are due to be completed later this year.</P>
      <P>However, since only a relatively small number of teachers at primary and post-primary level will work with pupils who present with autism, it would not be considered practical to amend the pre-service teacher training syllabus for this purpose. It is considered that it would be best to meet their training needs through the provision of specialised courses for teachers through in-career development courses</P>
      <P>A substantial range of in-career development courses is provided annually for teachers involved in remedial and special education who educate pupils with special needs. The range of courses include supports to individual teachers and groups of teachers to attend specific courses relating to the teaching of children with autism, and support for seminars and conferences for the teachers concerned. The other more general remedial and special education courses also benefit teachers of children with autism.</P>
      <P>An induction course was held in January last for the teachers of special classes for pupils with autism. This course will be made available to all other teachers of special classes for children with autism during the current year. Plans have recently been approved for specialist training for resource teachers who work in mainstream post-primary schools with pupils with autism and other special needs; implementation of these plans is due to commence this autumn.</P>
      <P>The issue of appropriate and planned provision for children with autism and other special needs at both primary and post-primary levels, including training for teachers, classroom assistants and resource teachers, is currently being considered by the Special Education Planning Group established in my Department. This group has been charged with bringing forward recommendations for arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality integrated service for all students with disabilities at all stages of the education system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the development of science in primary schools. All teachers in primary schools were issued with a new programme in science in September 1999 as part of the introduction of the revised curriculum. The programme is set out in two booklets a curriculum statement, incorporating the aims, objectives and content for each class level and guidelines for teachers on the teaching of the subject. The new science programme comprises four interlinked strands, namely: (1) living things; (2) energy and forces; (3) materials; and (4) environmental care.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the revised curriculum will be on a phased basis over four to five years and will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in-career professional development for teachers. The expectation is that most schools will choose to follow the sequence of subject-areas followed in the in-career development programme from year to year. It is planned that in-career professional development in science will form part of the ongoing primary curriculum support programme in the next school year, 2000-01. However schools will be free to introduce subject areas as they see fit, taking account of the expertise and interests of their staffs.</P>
      <P>To encourage schools to incorporate science in their curriculum, all primary schools were issued with grants in October 1999 to assist them with the purchase of science teaching equipment and materials. These grants amounted in total to approximately £1.75 million. The size of grant varied with the size of school: however a minimum grant of £400 was paid to schools of less than 50 pupils while schools of more than 500 pupils received the maximum grant of £1,000. A circular that was issued at the time indicated the types of equipment and materials that the grant could be expended upon. Schools are required to keep a record of all equipment purchased with the grant. Any queries in relation to this grant may be addressed to the primary administration section of my Department in Athlone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditional definitions of illiteracy, as an absolute, are generally not found useful by researchers. Most recently, researchers have adopted various measures of functional literacy to determine the number of people with serious literacy problems. My Department does not have data on standards by socio-economic groups, but it has information on the standards of pupils at some different age levels, and on the reading competence of adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data from the National Reading Surveys, <Col N="1012" /> 1993-1998 of pupils in fifth class and 11 years-old indicate that approximately 10% of pupils have serious literacy difficulties. There is evidence from these surveys that pupils who attend schools in designated areas of disadvantage perform significantly lower.</P>
    <P>Analysis of data from the 1991 IEA Study of Reading Literacy, International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement indicates that between 6.5% &ndash; 8.5% of Irish 14 year olds have serious literacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>A number of strategies have already been put in place to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The revised primary curriculum has been sent to all schools. There is an increased emphasis in the English curriculum on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills as part of a whole-language process. A significant programme of in-career development of teachers in regard to the introduction of this revised curriculum is well under way.</P>
    <P>The new leaving certificate English syllabus has a particular emphasis on literacy and follows on from the revised junior certificate syllabus. Greater attention is given to comprehension and composition thereby enhancing the development of literacy skills directly related to the three areas covered in the IALS study (1997).</P>
    <P>The remedial teaching service has been increased and now comprises of 1463 remedial teachers at primary level and over 500 at second level who support pupils with diagnosed literacy and other learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>In December 1998 all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 for the purchase of library books, with schools in designated areas of educational disadvantage receiving an additional £2,170 each, Furthermore, in October 1999 a minimum grant of £462 was issued to schools with 60 pupils or less for the purchase of library books, while schools with in excess of 60 pupils received a per capita grant of £7.70.</P>
    <P>The National Reading Initiative launched in January is a national effort to tackle the problem of poor reading achievements and to promote reading generally. The initiative acknowledges that the problem of low achievement and underachievement is not just a school-based problem. It stresses the importance of parents encouraging their children, by reading to them to develop their vocabulary and imagination and by listening to them read.</P>
    <P>In relation to adults, tables of the results for Ireland of the OECD International Adult Literacy Survey conducted in 1995 and published in 1997 by age group and socio-ecomonic status are attached. It is important to stress that this was not a survey of illiteracy, but rather of the different levels of skills which are needed for participation in a modern economy. Some 25% of the Irish population were found to score at the lowest level (Level 1), performing at best tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text, with no distracting information, and when the structure of the text assists the task. <Col N="1013" /> Since the survey, funding for adult literacy has increased from a base of £0.85 million in 1997 to £7.825 million in 2000 plus an additional £0.960m for programme development. Some £73.6m is being provided under the national development plan for the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Referral networks have been established on an area basis, involving key actors such as FAS, the local employment service, the area partnerships, welfare and health interests, the Garda and probation services, schools, youth services, to promote awareness of the service, and provide a structured mechanism for the identification of area needs and the referral of those in need to the service. Innovative approaches are expanding such as family literacy groups, involving both adults and their children, a number of open learning centres, literacy for specific groups such as travellers, special needs, and migrant women.</P>
    <P>An inter-Departmental literacy group has been established and has made an interim report to Government. Programmes for the unemployed in co-operation with FAS and the community employment scheme are being expanded to every FAS region following a successful pilot.</P>
    <P>A quality framework has been developed and nationally certified inservice programmes for staff are being implemented. The Department has commissioned the development of a TV series in literacy awareness and tuition for adults. Work is under way in collaboration with RTE and NALA with a view to broadcasting towards the end of the year. The programmes will be accompanied by materials and a free helpline.</P>
    <P>As a result of these initiatives, the number of clients catered for annually by the literacy service has increased from 5,000 to 13,000.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; was formally established on 1 September 1999. Most of the psychologists employed by my Department transferred to the new agency on that date, 43 in all. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission has now completed the process of selecting additional suitably qualified psychologists, who will join the agency in two stages. It is hoped that the first group will begin to take up their posts during the current school year.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that, by the end of the year 2000, when the current selection process has been completed, nearly 100 psychologists will be employed in NEPS. This will double the present number and, even allowing for the replacement of retired or promoted psychologists, will add considerably to the number available to provide a psychological service to schools and to the number of schools being provided with such a service.</P>

      <P>I fully recognise the importance of ensuring that teachers of special needs children, including children with autism, receive the necessary training to enable them to address the special needs involved.</P>
      <P>At the level of pre-service training, the existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs, including children with autism.</P>
      <P>Review groups were set up in 1999 in my Department to examine pre-service teacher education programmes for primary and post-primary teachers. The group for each area is required to have regard to developments in relation to catering for children with special needs. The reports of both groups are due to be completed later this year.</P>
      <P>Since only a relatively small number of teachers at primary and post-primary level will work with pupils who present with autism, it would not be considered practical to amend the pre-service teacher training syllabus for this purpose. It is considered that it would be best to meet the training needs of these teachers through the provision of specialised courses in the context of in-career development.</P>
      <P>A substantial range of in-career development courses are provided annually for teachers involved in remedial and special education. These include supports for individuals and groups of teachers to attend specific courses relating to the teaching of children with autism. Teachers who work with children who present with autism may apply to take the diploma in special education course in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra. This course is of one year's duration and deals with a range of special needs issues, including autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An induction course was held in January last for the teachers of special classes for pupils with <Col N="1018" /> autism. This course will be made available to all other teachers of special classes for children with autism during the current year. Plans have recently been approved for specialist training for resource teachers who work in mainstream post-primary schools with pupils with autism and other special needs. Implementation of these plans is due to commence this autumn.</P>
    <P>A special education planning group has been established in my Department to bring forward recommendations for arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality integrated service for all students with disabilities at all stages of the education system, including children with autism. The focus will be on ensuring that issues such as those raised by the Deputy will be addressed across the spectrum of special needs.</P>
    <P>My Department works in close cooperation with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards to ensure the coordinated delivery of support services for children with special needs, including children with autism.</P>

      <P>In setting up the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the intention is to mirror, in so far as is possible, the membership of the statutory authority. The membership of the statutory authority is as follows: the chairperson of the authority, the chief executive of the authority, two persons nominated by the Minister, one of whom shall be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, is representative of community and voluntary organisations, one person nominated by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the chairperson of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, the chairperson of the Further Education and Training Awards Council, one person nominated by universities, one person who, in the opinion of the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is representative of learners, one person nominated by Forfás, one person nominated by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, one person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, two persons nominated by the authority who have a special knowledge and experience related to the functions of the authority, at least one of whom shall be a person with international experience related to those functions.</P>
      <P>The priority in nominating persons to the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland is for those persons to have the necessary expertise and breadth of experience in the education and training area to enable them to fully contribute to the achievement of the objects of the authority and the Act.</P>

      <P>As a matter of general policy new primary schools are co-educational. This reflects the fact that the promotion of co-education is current Government policy and has been Government policy since the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>Given developments whereby parents are exercising choices for their children's education in terms of gaelscoileanna, denominational and multi-denominational schools, there are obvious economies of scale in providing co-educational rather than separate single-sex schools. However, this is not the overriding factor but rather that co-educating children of both sexes together is in keeping with the concept of equality between the sexes and provides a better basis for developing co-operative but equal roles for men and women in adult life.</P>

      <Quest>the number of remedial teachers employed in County Cork who are providing a service to four, five, six, seven and eight schools respectively; the schools involved in each cluster; his views on whether it is possible for a single teacher to provide an adequate level of remedial service in this regard; and the proposals, if any, he has to improve the service.</Quest>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of remedial teachers employed in County Cork providing a service to four, five, six, seven and eight teacher schools is not readily available in my Department. I will arrange to have the information forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, the remedial teacher service was extended to all first and second level schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios were also advised that they could seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special education review committee recommended that the general criteria for estab<Col N="1021" /> lishing remedial need should relate to pupils who have been identified as being below the 10th percentile on standardised tests in basic literacy and numeracy. The committee also recommended that the caseload of a remedial teacher catering for a single school should be 40 pupils. Where the post is shared with other schools, the committee recommended that the caseload be reduced by two for each school which is additional to the base school, subject to a maximum reduction of eight pupils.</P>
    <P>In extending the service on a nation-wide basis, every effort was made to adhere to the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee.</P>

      <P>Data on the percentage of total primary school payroll costs spent on inservice training are not available at present but will be furnished to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contain appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs. At second level, there are inputs to the higher diploma in education, as part of a general alertness orientation programme, on a variety of learning difficulties which pupils may have.</P>
      <P>Training for serving remedial teachers is provided on postgraduate diploma courses in six centres, as follows: St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra, Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines, Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, St. Angela's College of Education, Sligo, University College, Cork, University College, Galway.</P>
      <P>Each venue caters for up to 25 remedial teachers who, with the exception of St. Patrick's College which caters for primary teachers only, are selected from both primary and second-level schools. The training is organised differently in each of the centres but totals approximately 140 tuition hours in every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each centre, intensive training is provided to enable the remedial teachers to identify children <Col N="1022" /> with learning difficulties in both reading and mathematics, to diagnose the exact nature of those difficulties and to provide remedial tuition to meet those difficulties. It is felt that this degree of training with experienced teachers is appropriate and sufficient to enable them to carry out their duties as remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>Many shorter courses for teachers in the remedial and special education areas are financially supported by my Department. These are provided mainly through the network of education centres, teachers' organisations and the programme of summer courses for primary teachers.</P>
    <P>The provision of training and support for serving teachers of pupils with special educational needs at both primary and post-primary levels is at present under active consideration in my Department.</P>

    <P>In relation to the extent of increase in the income limits since 1990, the reckonable income limit in the case of a family with three dependent children in order to qualify for a full maintenance grant was £10,514. The current equivalent income limit is £19,200, which represents an increase of 82.6%. Over the period, February 1990 to February 1999, the Consumer Price Index increased by 20.9%.</P>
    <P>I intend to follow the practice in recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. The reckonable income limits for the 1999/2000 academic year were increased by 4.6%, based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1997 to March 1998. This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
    <P>The question of providing further additional increases in the reckonable income limits can only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that over 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that adequate secretarial and cleaning facilities are provided for a school (details supplied) in Dublin in view of the fact cleaning and caretaking is at present being carried out by teaching staff.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12012/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the school referred to by the Deputy is that it is currently involved in a secretarial sharing arrangement with another primary school under the 1978 scheme for the employment of secretaries in primary schools. There is no provision at the moment for the appointment of full time secretaries in posts that are being shared. In addition to the shared secretary arrangement, the school had up to this year been receiving an additional per capita grant of £15 per pupil, towards the cost of caretaking services, under the PESP scheme that was introduced in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the increased allocation that has been made available this year, and effective from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils became eligible for a grant towards caretaking services under this scheme. In addition I increased the rate of grant by 33% to £20 per pupil. This has resulted in the grant for caretaking services to this school increasing from <Col N="1025" /> £5,190 in 1999 to £6,880 this year. My Department has already issued the increased grant to the school.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, with effect from January 2001, all primary schools will become eligible for grant assistance under this scheme. My Department has recently issued a circular to all to all schools on this matter.</P>
    <P>The allocation for grant assistance to schools in respect of caretaking and secretarial services increased from approximately £5.6 million in 1999 to £11.2 million this year. I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that in framing proposals for the spending of the increased allocation, it was necessary for me to examine means of ensuring that all schools would receive assistance from my Department in respect of such services. The scheme that I have put in place will mean that from January of 2001 all primary schools will, for the first time, be receiving grant assistance in respect of these services from my Department. In addition the increase of 33% in the rate of grant also means that schools that were already receiving assistance have had their grant levels significantly increased.</P>

      <Quest>the plans his Department has to provide education facilities at primary and secondary levels for children suffering from Down's syndrome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Children suffering from less serious forms of Down's syndrome can be capable of participating in the education system on a fully integrated basis, with the support where necessary of the resource teacher service or the special needs assistant service.</P>
      <P>Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special needs within the primary system, including children with Down's syndrome, now have an automatic entitlement to the support services they require to enable them to participate fully in the education system. The services in question may take the form of resource teacher support or special needs assistant support, or both, depending on the particular needs involved. Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated more than 300 extra resource teachers and more than 700 extra special needs assistants to support special needs children, including children with Down's syndrome, within the primary sector.</P>
      <P>Children with Down's syndrome who attend second level schools on a fully integrated basis are supported by special extra tuition allocations and child care support if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases the level of special need involved can be such as to warrant placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary <Col N="1026" /> school. A range of such facilities is provided to cater for the variety of levels of need which can arise. Each special school and special class operates at a reduced pupil teacher ratio. The ratios in question can vary from 11:1 in the case of children with a mild general learning disability to 6:1 where more severe disabilities are involved. The pupil teacher ratios applicable in all cases are in line with those recommended by the special education review committee. Children attending all such facilities also attract special rates of capitation funding and have access to special funding for the purchase of specialised equipment where required.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring that all special needs children, including children with Down's syndrome, receive the support they require to enable them to derive maximum benefit from the education system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level, temporary accommodation has been provided at existing schools in the Naas area to cater for immediate requirements. Architectural planning for a new 16-classroom school <Col N="1032" /> is under way and it is expected that, when this building becomes available, there will be sufficient accommodation available in the town to meet medium-long-term requirements.</P>
    <P>At second level, building projects are well under way in all three schools in Naas. It is envisaged that the accommodation thus provided will enable the schools to meet the immediate and long-term requirements of the area. The proposed extension at one of these schools has been revised to include 100 additional places. This will enable the school in question cater for 900 pupils in the long-term.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor developments in Naas to ensure that any emerging additional demands are promptly addressed.</P>

      <P>The revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994 and is operated by <Col N="1033" /> schools of nursing in association with third level colleges. The programme is funded by the Department of Health and Children and is fully operational since 1998. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. While undertaking the diploma programme, the students' fees are paid by the relevant health agency and they receive an annual non means-tested maintenance grant and other supports.</P>
      <P>I understand that a total of 1,215 training places were filled in 1999, comprising 812 in general nursing, 254 in psychiatric nursing and 149 in mental handicap nursing. Furthermore, in response to the nursing shortage, the action plan agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike, provides for an increase of some 300 additional training places on the nursing registration-diploma programmes in 2000. The intention is that 1,500 training places will be available; 1,000 in general nursing, 300 in psychiatric nursing and 200 in mental handicap nursing.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring an adequate supply of high quality output from the PLCs, institutes of technology and universities at sub-degree, degree and post graduate levels in order to maintain and enhance our ability to attract and retain highly mobile international investment in an increasingly knowledge based global economy. The Government established the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs as part of the business, education and training partnership set up to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skill needs, manpower needs estimation, and education and training for business. In response to the first report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, the Government provided a £75 million investment plan to provide an additional 5,400 places predominantly in the engineering and computer hardware and software areas.</P>
      <P>The second report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs has recently been published. In the area of graduate skills, the report considered the chemical and biological sciences sector and made a number of recommendations, which are currently being considered.</P>
      <P>Another initiative in the technology area is the provision of some 1,500 postgraduate places on a skills conversion programme for 1999-00 to meet skills needs in the ICT area as identified by the expert skills group.</P>
      <P>Arising from the work of the joint education-industry task force to improve the supply of technicians to the high-technology sector, an industry-college initiative was introduced in 1998 to jointly recruit, educate and train technicians. The national certificate in manufacturing technology was initiated in January 1998 in nine institutes of technology. The course involves structured work placement for six months as an integral part of the course and based on a partnership between industry and institutes with industrial involvement in course design, selection and placement. There are some 1,100 students currently on accelerated technician programmes in the institute of technology sector attending courses in the following skills shortage areas &ndash; manufacturing technology, computing, IT support, and industrial science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns about the uptake of physics and chemistry at leaving certificate link into the future supply of skills, particularly in the light of Ireland's evolution into a high technology economy. This issue is being addressed at second level through the modernisation of school laboratories, <Col N="1035" /> the revision of different science syllabi and the provision of extensive training for teachers.</P>
    <P>These initiatives and the planned investment provided for in the national development plan are indicative of the Government's commitment to meeting the skills needs of the Irish economy now and in the years ahead.</P>
